Weather isnÂ´t loaded because i need to configure it again.
But busy installing other things first.
Oh man this file moving / deleting not being utterly shit is so nice.
FF6 has a relic that lets the wearer dual-wield.
And rather than any complicated maths when you attack they just attack with one weapon and then again with the other immediately after.
This also applies if you use Mug which means Locke now has two steal attempts =D.
So youÂ´re telling my ff6 has a relic that just makes dual weidling the superior option for damage ?
But you don't get a shield.
And you only have two relic slots.
Meanwhile because of how Espers work in this game.
Terra has the following black magic Fire Fira Blizzara Thundara.
The unupgraded versions are probably not relevant anymore anyway.
Nah I'm still at the level range where the lower MP cost is worth it.
I'm actually using Cure though because this dungeon is full of zombies.
Love killing zombies undead with healing.
Argh forgot I had to properly design my sorcerer build for todays game.
And sorcerers can't even spam Magic Missile in 13A!
But as my choices are atm it would be level 1 magic missile which seems like a waste.
Used the talent that gives me a spell of equal level to my sorc spells from the wizard list on force salvo.
Because that is too good to pass up.
Also still unclear to me if this works like wizard who has to prepare spells ahead of time or if I can just spontaneously pick from the list until I run out of spells...With at wills in the system I guess it works like with wizard.
It works like a wizard.
The spells are just different.
And have some sorcerer only mechanics.
Like the spell boost for a turn or the breath spells.
I'm familiar with the mechanics just spell selection is bothering me atm. Well that and what I will use my final talent on.
Should have discussed with my GM which one of those would fit thematically.
Wait theres a talent for that?
There fucking should be.
Sadly I dont see that in the talents.
I haven't looked at sorcerer in a while.
Must just be feats.
Wait these guys are having a kickstarter?
So windows 7 has a pure white background for its notification area.
And a few notification icons that are pure white and transparant.
Which contrasts great if they are on the taks bar.
But are just empty squares in the folded out notification box.
ChaosSmurf btw turns out I have an awful memory and Love Letter had the correct number of romance cubes.
I saw the video p.
Noelor you fucked it.
Noelor almost sold me on 13th Age.
I was scrolled up.
Painting faces is a pain in the butt.
Certainly at those scales.
I've used a quick guide from WD #9 from 2014 with decent result.
What realm were we on.
In future I am going to give as many guys helmets as possible.
I need to finish painting my stormtroopers so I stop having second thoughts about the colour scheme and try to strip paint off them all and start again.
I just went with the default scheme but black fatigues.
This is a cool site.
Races aren't as balanced as I expected and classes are way more so.
Anathema If not juse use the steps on page 45.
And the Wheelies have been around since vanilla.
ChaosSmurf thats because race is not mechanically relevant anymore nor mechanically interesting.
So peole just pick what they prefer and turns out people prefer certain things more than others.
MairBear i neeeed you.
To win a game.
So let me know if you are going to be playing sometime plz ?
MoonWolf my quests are for paladin warrior and priest.
MoonWolf surprised so many prefer human.
I picked it for animations and racials many years ago.
I also didn't think the Blood Elf stuff was true.
ChaosSmurf iÂ´m honestly not. A lot of people honestly like the Normal or Default thing.
MoonWolf gonna give a game a try now if you like.
Same as how the vast majority of players in ME picked soldier.
Instead of anything with actual different mechanics.
Yeah but it was also best.
Man maybe I'm everything I hate.
Yeah but the whole soldier is just Â¨guns betterÂ¨.
And everyone gets to guns.
So from my point of view its an empty choice on my gameplay.
Wouldn't you also expect warrior to get a boost though?
Sure they get a boost in power on guns.
For being FANTASY MAN WITH SWORD.
Okay so weÂ´re assuming that on the whole all classes are roughly equally powerfull.
If i pick soldier i get to guns good.
If i pick vanguard i get to guns not as good but i get fun gravity powers.
If i pick biotic i guns pretty bad but i still have guns but i also have tons of gravity powers.
Does that make sense ?
Never saw much appeal in the other races when I created my main back then. vOv.
Yeah I've read the stuff Bioware have said about Mass Effect numbers.
But I'm interested as to why it doesn't apply to WoW classes.
MairBear on my way.
Not to mention I just like being a middle ground without any specializations or massive drawbacks.
ChaosSmurf WoW its different because you donÂ´t play or make the choice in a vacuum.
Middle Of The Road Man.
While race they have basically made a vacuum.
Since its effects so every little.
It's why I usually tend to play humans in most rpgs and such.
On the other hand class effects who you can play with how easily you can group. what loot is available to you etc.
When I started I went nelf because I was still Illidan obsessed. But Pandaren is my current majority.
So provided that all classes are roughly equal.
ItÂ´ll sort of balance out.
I guess every friend/family group will pick a different class each.
I was thinking but I rarely see other human warriors! but that's because I play barely anything but game-balanced dungeons.
Where two of one class is avoided.
Its like saying Â¨but i rarely see other tanksÂ¨ in a 5 man.
Ofcourse you donÂ´t you are the tank.
Makes me feel special.
I don't know why people like DPSing but I'm glad they do.
They like big crits and being top of the little meter.
But tanks even do good damage now.
Tbh I expect healing is even more of a power trip.
But also it's hard and the buck stops with you.
MairBear this is a weird priest deck.
Thanks for the pack MairBear.
Was it good? o.
Got a prep as an epic card.
I'd like epics for dust c.
So I can get Boom.
Still saving for boom.
ChaosSmurf still needed a second deck to enable 5-player so w/e.
So in todays game round 2 of the final combat had the sorcerer down both our melees confused and the priest halfway down.
Managed to finish the combat with only one melee dead.
Confuse is such a brutal effect.
Well I say melee it was the bard who died.
Bard is a melee class.
Unless you build it very specifically.
Yes but in my mind bard will never be anything.
Bards are a horrible class that for some reason keeps getting put in every dnd and dnd clone.
People should use Chanters from PoE.
But how else are you going to get away seducing the barmaid?
I am not sure he even had the highest charisma in our party.
Since our party has a priest who may or may not be charismatic a sorcerer and a paladin.
The paladins OUT is the most beautiful man in the world.
Who is a paladin of whatever the god for beautiful things is.
Incidentally we named that god Bowie this session.
The leader of his order is Ridge Forrester.
I'm with Robin on this one.
I have to give the man props for putting so much effort into his facial hair.
That is some serious grooming that went into it.
1959 <- accurate FE play.
There's a journal entry in Bayo 2 called rules of nature.
I'd like to point out some of those gods were genuinly... gods.
The 16 that is.
That is pretty hype.
I forgot this game was happening.
Either they are bi or someone had a change of sexuality there.
Oh the Transistor LP finally had its last update.
Back then that was HIGH DEFINTION.
The joke not the subject of the photo.
That looks surprisingly adorable.
I don't think i want to this game about playing a dragon.
!note ChaosSmurf Initial accepted list of games.
!note MairBear this could be neat.
Bleh I did not sleep well last night.
Watched interstellar last night.
Liked it right up untill The Thing happened.
Liked it a lot less afterwards.
I still need to watch that.
Man really looks like EU tokens will be twice the price of US tokens forever.
Oh wow look at that.
They've made the website nice.
ChaosSmurf wonder how that compares to the real money costs.
Nicer at any rate.
MoonWolf ah this isn't a schedule.
IE I wouldn't be surprised if we pay more taking the exchange rates into account.
No its just the list of accepted submissions.
Does it say which weekend it is?
Trihex 100% yoshi's island sign me up.
July 24th â€” Aug 3rd 2015.
Don't know how much stuff that dodges.
EVO and E3 at least.
I think it dodges most important stuff.
Not sure about some esports tournaments.
Certainly not during a dreamhack or something though.
I think GDQ's bigger than everything except EVO E3 League finals International.
According to an article quoted in my text book a Harvard student wrote his own Wikipedia article to demonstrate a point for an essay and as of the article's writing it still says he is the mayor of a small town in China.
It dodges the window in which I can book time off work this summer -.
Omg they're doing Sonic Boom.
Besides which it's when Broelor is back in the country.
Which is why I know I can't take it off work if I could I already would have.
Minister they've got pretty good at scheduling really interesting stuff in times friendly to both continents.
Is Shantae and the Pirate's Curse not like ecchi-at-best?
It's standard level male-gaze-y.
But I thought it was on Wii?
Nah it's on PC.
Eh I'd call Shantae silly cheesecake vOv.
Oh rad an Ori run.
I might be thinking of a different game then.
It's standard level male-gaze-y <- nah its a bit above that.
The male gaze bits of Suits are annoying.
She's wearing a harem outfit and wips people with her hair.
Ok I'm thinking of something else.
I mean I've been playing Bayonetta so I probably can't talk.
ChaosSmurf learn to program and come work for my company.
Anathema I'm worried that would take 4 years or so.
Something something Skullgirls something.
ChaosSmurf i like the saltometer.
Its a nice touch.
As in... anticipated salt level on failure?
No it jus tshows percentages of accepted and rejected runs.
The fuck is going on here.
Also showed undecided and bonus stuff.
People get REALLY angry over runs that get in or not.
Oh cool they're doing Tetris again.
Like its a massive drama fest each 6 months.
ChaosSmurf after this winter how could they not.
The GDQ metagame of what games will turn out to be shit runs with bad runners is my favourite.
My text book has informed me that the etymology of plagiarism is from the Latin word for a kidnapper plagiarus.
Whats wrong with shantae?
Turn over the page next section...
No one wants to be a kidnapper.
Considering the amount of kidnapping that happens i doubt that somehow.
Someone out there right now REALLY just can't wait to be a kidnapper.
Yeah the portal runs are joining the sonic/megaman/metroidvania pile for me.
There is always a whole bunch of them each year they are virtually idendtical from last time and just blegh.
At least they're only 15 mins.
But I'd rater watch HL/2 every time.
2.5 hours of Borderlands D.
Oh cool they're doing a Doom WAD run.
Haven't played that one but have played some by the same dude I think.
What does WAD stand for anyway?
It's the name of the file extension doom uses.
I dunno if it stands for anything.
But this weekend I learned back in 96 people capitalised MOD.
Yeah saw it this morning.
Haven't had time to read it yet but saw some of the replies.
Their anti-psychic defenses are the best.
Is that the narrative one ?
The rock was little too big.
I am pleased to announce that Ms. B previously Director of Health Safety Environment for our UK business has now been appointed as UK Health and Safety Director.
Such a good... promotion?
Promoted to a shorter title.
Fits better on a buisness card.
Is probably the UK's foremost tunneller.
Pierce the Heavens etc.
Liked Interstellar right up untill The Thing happened <- yeah pretty much.
So I have an ISA account which for those outside the UK is a type of savings account.
It's got a high level of interest and said interest is immune to tax but there's a cap on how much you can invest each year and they're usually pretty inflexible.
I wanted to check on it because I'm thinking of buying a flat.
The one I have I had to apply for online.
So when I couldn't log in on the website I rang up the helpline to check on why.
Turns out even though I needed to apply for it online my online account for accessing it was never set up?
Secondarily my understanding of investment was that the whole point was that interest got added onto your account and then itself generated interest etc.
Compound interest basic middle-school maths.
Turns out the interest from my ISA has been getting siphoned back to the original account I invested from so the ISA itself has no more money than I started with.
Which I mean I know technically *I* have more money but it's still annoying to me.
So are things gonna get switched for something more beneficial?
Well in that a flat is more useful to me than liquid assets.
I'm really awful at handling my finances not got an ISA.
There are rolling fixed term deposits somewhere around 20-30k.
But to do net banking with my bank requires first postal application for telephone banking.
Second access telephone banking and request internet banking.
Third postal application for internet banking.
Fourth access internet banking.
Your bank is horrid.
Let me tell you how you get internet banking with my bank.
Step 1 have an account.
Or something like that it's been a few years since I read up.
Step 2 get your hands on a random reader. any will do you can request a personal one from the bank in like 5 ways.
Go to the website to bank online.
The random reader is a 3 factor authentication tool.
You need it to log in and authorize actions.
Well i suppose you also need the bank card.
Does your bank just hate anything past the year 1990 BwaS ?
Serously post application to GET phone banking.
Both technologies that are basically obsoleted by the internet when it comes to banking.
For instance they send me Maestro debit cards they're fun as fuck trying to get recognised in some places.
They work over here.
Because Maestro debit cards are the default.
Well debit cards are.
And 90% of our banks are meastro compatible.
It's pretty much accepted but Dubai I remember stared at it thinking wtf is this phoney mastercard.
Most of the web I get by they either take it or take PP which takes it.
Really dubai didn't accept it.
Of all the nations there i'd have though dubai was most likely to have no problems.
Then ya get K$ and I think google wallet.
K$ goes through amazon.
Nico is saaaaaaad.
She's sad because the runaways are not a comic anymore.
I'm sad too nico i'm sad too.
But she's part of an all girl Avengers team now.
Yeah but this lacks little mutant girls punching skysharks.
Also lacks The Best Skrull.
4chan slow for anyone else?
Looks about as fast as normal.
>all girl Avengers team now <- by which we mean a team that is literally all the girls.
Not a team that is composed only of girls though also that.
All the girls in an avengers team.
Pokémon blue catch 'em all run.
Kirby game utilizing tilt controls. This run is extra fun to watch because I tilt the whole gamecube to control the game. lol.
Looks like i should have read some of these mor eclosely.
The difference in the estimates between any% and glitchless in Earthbound Mother 2 is 3 hours v.
Oh cool Dustforce is coming back.
Maybe this time they won't softlock the game into being uncompletable seconds before ending.
I either missed that or had forgotten.
I have lost one soldier.
OTOH including the Baneblade I can make 1500 points now.
Horrible phobia of bananas.
Thats a lizard alright.
And I was talking about monitor lizards.
But the NPC kept interrupting.
So I had to keep starting again.
And one time I said monitor wizard.
Noelor so did you finally get to tell the npcs about monitor wizards though ?
He didn't agree with my analogy.
The monitor lizard was an analogy for the NPC.
Elegant Saber of the People> rolls 7 dice to emotionally blackmail Fervorous Harbinger of Glory 1099910 86 9 successes.
9 because I spent willpower.
Harbinger is now getting medical attention that he wouldn't admit he needed.
Because I looked at him tsunderely.
Tsundere is actually the context of his intimacy to me.
You can't look at him both ways its one or the other.
I can never remember which is which though.
And saying I tsundere'd him was more amusing.
Havent drawn anything since I started FF14. So I decided to badly scribble this thing while watching a dark souls video.
It seems very happy.
Even for a skeleton.
Well it was meant to.
Synopsis for the latest plastic memories episode seems promising maybe it'll be good again.
Last wk was pretty slapstick.
Well it was not as good as the first episode but it did have its moments this week.
Hopefully next week will keep up and we'll get another retrieval.
Scroll to new items for quick highlights.
Holy gold reward overhaul.
I literally didn't understand any of that.
Roughly less gold per kill especially creeps. bonus from kills based off of the net worth of the people involved.
I presume to make comebacks easier and to make peole get less gold if they are utterly dominating.
Oh and a massive jungle nerf.
Change to mud golems seems v. good.
Means shen and enchantress can now bring them along i think.
Plus you don't just get fucked if you're going x build with y character and get a double golems spawn.
Anyway these items lets check them out.
There's one that builds out of two hyperstones.
Mango is mana tango.
How very original in the naming.
Oh mekanism no longer a dead end.
Though it means you waste your mek cooldown.
When people just want mana.
Still it gives supports and mek builders a thing to go into after mek for reasonable cost.
Not sure if its Good Enough.
But its a nice idea.
I don't understand that item.
Are you a carry ? Did you 6 slot. Is the game still going ? do you want permanen non item stat boosts.
Did you read alch's Aganihm's?
Stop fucking around with armlet icefrog.
Radiance Burn now causes affected enemies to have a 17% miss rate <- hello cancer lancer.
Chain Frost projectile speed from 675 to 750 <- this is one of those change that just goes up and down every other patch.
Chain forst isn't good enough wait its too good wait its not good enough.
Lol morphling scepter upgrade.
Oh god that alchemist scepter bonus.
Why would you DO that.
Buy your team non slotted aghanims bonusses.
Well this is going to shake up the meta.
And by shake up the meta i mean alchemist is going to be first pick/ban every time.
It sounds like it's going back to two years ago.
Oh and shens all over the place.
Because who doesn't want semi permanent ancients as pets.
Valve decided maybe this whole mods payment thing was a bad idea.
And just cancelled it outright.
It'll be back next Bethseda game day 1 mark my words.
And now I don't care.
I don't think they'll do it in a Bethesda game again.
Maybe whatever Valve's next thing is.
ChaosSmurf okay but see the valve model is a author hands them models and they integrate it for what basically amounts to cosmetics only.
I mean sometimes in TF2 new items came with gameplay impact.
But on the whole not so much.
For bethseda it was gameplay impact directly.
Every single TF2 item that isn't a hat has a gameplay effect.
Dota 2 is all visuals.
But not gameplay effects dictated by the modder.
Designed by the people who made them.
I mean I'm sure Valve balances them out a bit.
I thought valve was reponsible for that.
That would involve Valve being involved in some way.
They're not so big on that.
ChaosSmurf that rewteet about paid mods you made like 8 hours ago is infuratingly DUMB.
Nobody is making a living on 25% of revenue and the price the market can carry on mods.
You're basically being paid 25% of the money to do customer support on your mod so valve and bethseda do not have too.
You could make a living out of selling stuff on Steam at 1%.
Do you know how big Steam is.
Anyway nobody disagrees that the percentages were bad.
I know the sales rates of the mods that were on sale on steam.
Bethesda's cut was ludicrous.
Finished reading twitter good to know america still has that police thing going on.
Steam is huge but the market for people willing to pay for mods is low.
Was worried i wouldn't have stories about how american police murder black people for a few weeks.
But no they got it right back up there.
I really hate the ALL POLICE HATE BLACK PEOPLE stuff.
Pretty difficult to argue against.
I don't disagree with the facts.
I just wish my twitter was about things my friends were doing.
That like to tweet things people like to retweet on both topics.
MoonWolf don't worry in two weeks you can hear about how are going to ruin Britain forever.
Britain is already ruined forever so no change there.
Don't be silly Ana.
SNP are going to win every seat in Scotland and enter into an alliance with Labour to become the patron saints of the left wing.
Then they'll ignore reality to make all the good things happen and none of the bad things.
But labour aren't left-wing.
They are in election season.
Twitter filters are your friend v.
Oh I've been waiting for this.
None and thats a shame.
I should make an effort to do better.
Yes a cave-in of the universe!
Jesus chist how is zune so bad.
The power of microsoft.
Download error thanks zune after all you shit this is just what I wanted.
GlennCuttlefish it hasn#t been updated in literal years.
This sounds like a terrible idea v also hey its the same keyboard as me.
Well I guess the final results look decent but the aesthetics are so clashing at the same time.
A paintjob might help.
Fluff is awesome but if you hate everything Space Marines you might have a hard time finding interesting novels to read from the black library. saddest fact.
Still waiting for the next Ghost book which has been pushed forward twice now.
Saved in case i ever need you to fight a landshark.
Have an updated version with more.
Including a possibly dickish gnome.
Anathema tiny babies think HH is space marine books.
Not actually just fantastic.
Aren't they about space marines?
Well not all of them.
There are some parts of it that are non marines.
30k marines are also really different.
And some number are about chaos obv.
This is before the whole Cleanse purge kill thing thats their motto these days.
And usually they're about the primarchs so it's more like they're about demigods.
I mean rules wise in 30k Marines don't even have They shall not know fear.
Because OH BOY DO THEY LEARN FEAR QUICKLY.
Yeah especially once the daemons enter the picture.
Only two weeks until the new Mad Max movie.
What is happening tomorrow?
I'm making some people fight dice monsters in 13th age.
I have a feeling I'm supposed to be doing something tomorrow but I can't remember what it is and ther eis nothing in my calendars.
NA wow tokens getting as ow as 18.8k.
Global market pls Blizz.
Oh neat. X-Wing vs TIE Fighter is on Steam now.
This is REALLY JAPAN.
For a series about not looking at panties this has more plot than I expected.
But how much backstory?
I mean too much plot might be heavy so that needs to be countered by solid backstory.
Or reasonable amounts of backstory.
Two is a perfectly nice pleasant person whose only fault is being a bit naively optimistic. She is in a stable loving relationship with her disciple with no weird sexual hang-ups or kinks between the two. In her spare time she comes up with cuisine using meat from monsters wandering the desert to help better feed people living in the harsh desert climate. And she takes care of fucking.
War orphans like they're her own children just out of the goodness of her heart. She cannot exist in Drakengard's universe. Blood must flow!
Look some people just have to die.
And by some people I mean just about everybody who has ever see an intoner.
Or heard of one.
Or is an intoner.
Intoners have to extra die.
Oh that was a somewhat disappointing twist.
Granted that was just the fight prelude.
Cooked_Auto i'm still holding out for the orphans eating two.
Maybe or they've already been dead for a long time.
My copy of Wakfu arrived today \o/.
Saved in case i ever need you to fight a landshark <- and we'll know how to cook it!
Sound! Euphonium dot jpeg.
My copy of wakfu is still somewhere on the way.
They opened a portal to some kind of british hell in that?
Oh cool wow token info has added differentiation to its curves.
Finally checked the second episode of this dungeon waifu anime. Still not sure if I like it or not.
That the one with the string?
I stopped after 1 ep which is granted longer than I gave gunslinger.
I typed measuring into google.
First suggestion angles second suggestion bra size.
BwaS it's worth following on twitter took.
If you're looking for when it's cheapest.
As much as I have around 150k on my main I'm keeping clear of wow tokens.
I just like looking at graphs.
Following today's shopping trip I decided to measure myself and see what size I am in the wacky world of women's clothing.
The answer probably unsurprisingly is that I'm insufficiently curved.
Though as I'm closer to an hourglass than some girls I am once again annoyed at fashion.
Ah the cliche scene in every SoL where the protag gets squeezed and is found to be an A-cup to much derision from her peers.
It's actually my waist.
403642 so size 16 for BH but 20 for W.
Based on John Lewis' website and self-measured with tape.
Not middle class honest.
It was the first thing on google that wasn't a specific brand something else or wikipedia which is just an article about what BWH stands for.
The chinese tokens are 70k gold.
Jesus christ how heretical.
? big head mode mod.
This is the sort of hiphop I can get behind.
Aww man there was another pin game for prequel and I missed it <.
Why wouldn't there be ?
MoonWolf did you see my tweet about the zine I bought?
Can't say i have.
My flgs has a small section of shelves dedicated to lgbtq comics.
Look to annoy me you would cancel the game in about 30 minutes when I am no longer here.
Between games last night I bought one called Down With the Cis-tem.
That... sure is a name.
I mean bonus points for the pun.
Bought it as opposed to any of the others entirely due to the pun yes.
Opened co and immediately I am again annoyed for missing that pin. Guess I will have to avoid that board for a while now.
There was another prequel pin game.
Well the game is still there but no more pins.
I didn't realise it was for a pin again.
Not that I'd have got one.
I got hit a lot because the controls are a bit ass also I'm bad at games but srsly.
The controls are..okay. mostly I just failed with the seemingly RNG mines.
This is a letter... In a way it is similar to modern emails except that the information is not digital and delivery is not immediate.
Thanks for letting us know.
Soon kids will need to have that explained to them!
The main difference between chatrooms and forums is that forums are asynchronous more practical.
Oh dear someone messed up some formatting.
The accreditation for an infographic Blass 2012 was placed below a tweet.
Said tweet quite evidently not being by the same author due to y'know @NathanFillion being at the top.
And yes the book defines infographic and tweet.
How do you know Nathan Fillion didn't write your textbook!?
Which y'know again fair enough.
He isn't on the authors page.
And again the accreditation suggests that someone other than Nathan Fillion wrote the tweet.
Not the other way round.
But it's got the blue tick!
Stop ruining my jokes with your Noelorness.
I bought some new cufflinks with rainbows on.
A couple of the colours are a bit off though.
Do you habitually wear cufflinks?
Reddish orange yellow green blue cyan purple.
Anathema maybe 1/3rd of my work shirts are double cuffed.
Oh right you need to wear shirts to work.
I think we've gone over Minister cufflink suit thing before.
I'm trying to distract myself from the boring task of updating some unit tests.
What the hell Zero step it up a little. You're getting outperformed by your own damn dragon.
Daaayum new Vivaldi browser has a wee loading bar on the tab label for unfocused tabs.
That is quite slick.
You mean like Chrome?
Anathema doesn't believe in other browsers.
Chrome doe snot do that.
Oh I am a version behind.
Unless you will literally only accept a bar.
What is the latest chrome?
As opposed to a wheel.
'cause 42 has nothing.
And yes I will only accept a bar.
Since the wheel does not indicate progress only it is still doing stuff.
Its still a dumb wheel.
People have already matchfixed for fucking HATS.
And you want to bet real money on this.
Bad idea is bad.
Guys i need mumble details.
It is in fact 07.
Did you use the password as your username?
Because i am an intelligent man.
MoonWolf add mumble integration to PatternSpider.
To what end ?
!mumble -> list of people on + clickable URL to join the channel.
<--- there is the endpoint for our box.
I'll look into it tomorrow.
I could do it if you cba.
You'd need to get PS compiling first.
Eh I only didn't bother earlier because I was on my work PC! at home I don't mind doing the hard bits! p.
Although why you gotta compile that IRC lib from scratch? isn't there a nuget package?
I don't think there is a nuget and even if there is its probably outdated.
Do you what license it is?
Omfg you didn't put a license on relaychains either.
I literally do not care.
Neither does anyone else.
Its a mediocre markov chain.
MoonWolf there you go.
I hope this makes you happy.
I was expecting you to have snuck some sort of wierd change in there.
But its just MIT.
Github has a cool thing where when it sees you trying to add a file called 'license' it gives you a list of popular licenses and lets you pick one and it automatically put your name in from you github profile.
I wanted a license on RelayChains so I can make it a nuget package without issues p.
Anathema but what if i update it.
It has actually had updates and released you knwo.
Then I'll have to update my fork and create another package!
This is the effort I will go to to make cloning PS and 'build' just working a reality!
Its less effort to just drop the libraries in.
I do 'git clean -fdx' -> rebuild often.
To make sure things still work froma clean slate.
So reaching behind my back to scratch is currently agony may have gone too hard at the gym.
You can do it gramps!
The lesson here kids is to always finish your workout with proper stretching even if you are rushing because it is lunch time.
Are you sure thats the lesson ?
Yes some stretching has reduced the pain to discomfert.
I think facebook is trying to start some shit with me.
MoonWolf that thing from the breaking madden guy is brilliant.
One of the suggested groups is polyamoria.
ChaosSmurf it really is.
GlennCuttlefish it just thinks you have a lot of love in your hearth.
He's a god damn artist.
In some way or form.
I had it during hashtag indyref they suggested I like Yes Scotland.
Back in high school in Scotland we took the plastic guards that people put on growing trees to stop deer stripping the bark and sledded straight down the back of the school.
Anathema why can't i connect to mumble ?
Because you did something wrong obviously.
Lets see if I can.
I made sure i could connect and i had the details earlier today just to avoid this shit.
And so is glenn.
Well it seems you did it wrong.
Thats right right ?
Yeah thats what i'm using.
But i'm getting 205932 Server connection failed The remote host closed the connection.
So not even a password failure.
Just not allowed in.
Just tried connecting to another server.
Stop banning moonwolf anathema.
One of the public ones in the list.
I'm going to try reconnecting at 2130 since we are waiting on Noelor anyway.
Noelor is already on mumble v.
Cooked_Auto Xmen 3rd Class?
If that doesn't work i'm very sorry but there will be no game.
Noelor mhm. Not too sold on Jubilee.
That jubilee just lets you know just how fucking early 90's that outfit was.
Its the hair that bugs me the most.
I thin windows 10 lacks the original font i used for the loot cards.
Cooked_Auto she's 80s Jubilee though.
I think even 80's Jubilee had short hair.
Actual Jubilee printed in the 80s if she even was printed in the 80s yes.
However this is a movie made now and set in the 80s.
So they have to have a character with super-80s hair.
And Jean's already on shoulderpad duty.
Also I'm guessing Cyc in the grey sleeveless sweater and Colossus in the red t-shirt?
Waiting didn't do SHIT.
!note Anathema I can't connect to your mumble whats up with that ?
3 of those band names are completely unreadable.
I really am very sorry about this I thought I had mumble set up just earlier today.
I don't know what changed.
At least if I were a fan of Party Cannon I'd know what band I was bopping to.
Oh noes but no worries indeed.
Welp now I just have to come up with plan B.
Guess Im falling back to my plan B earlier than anticipated.
Unless other ideas exist.
Why do gay people keep doing this to themselves.
You are gay stop making your own life HARDER.
In fact I bet he bets the GAYS did this.
>a play on the word harder in vicinity to a story about dick pics.
Boehning said Smithâ€™s disclosure of the photos was part of a campaign to retaliate against him for his vote against the anti-discrimination bill.
Yes how dare civilian do some snooping to point out your hypocrisy!
He might be believed if he was the only gay public figure that was publicly against gay rights.
Just one more in a long line.
Glenn Wanna play TSW or should I just do something else?
Err. Sure if you can tolerate being around...whatever zone I was in.
The one with the amusement park.
Lets just say Im vovergeared for that place by now so combat should be easy.
Its like overgeared by vivverent.
I was going to say vastly overgeared but I dont think thats the same.
Wonder how many patches will I require for this to actually start.
Not thaaaat many I think.
Well technically not that many.
Unfortunately this isn't exactly downloading fast.
Its only 300 megabytes but at 10KB/s.
It goes up and down.
With this rate it will still take...10 to 20ish minutes.
Oh man Ive totally missed Feinne's next LP.
You've missed so much ar tonelico.
This one isn't worse than the third one!
Its still pretty japan though.
I think I never actually bothered finishing the previous ones now that I think about it.
You didn't miss much.
Also the story is completly disconnected.
I think i've forgotten most of ar tonelico 3.
And i genuinly enjoyed some parts of 1 and 2.
But 3 man 3 was just the worst thing.
Noelor catching perfect zapdos is hard D.
Now i Just have to remember the damn password.
Man zero was such a good show.
According to task manager it is launching.
But we all know task manager lies.
Yeah it can be sluggish.
Overall the game is horribly optimized.
Woo got pass on the second try.
Worst part is the first loading.
Spawned right next to some kind of super zombie off to a good start.
Apparently in China they discovered a Maniraptor with memboranus wings its called Yi qi.
In this week's Pleiades the lasses are headed for the Moon of all places.
I fear since this is a Gainax anime the weak Lance of Longinus parallel is intended.
Get it out of the way quick.
Well its a magical girl show by gainax.
So the ending is going to be weird and depressing.
The server log does not let you know why i keep getting connection failed.
Cooked_Auto try login to mumble.
SunTiger looks like when you kept logging in with the password as your name it banned you for some reason.
Yeah i'm in now.
Had people over when you mentioned it on irc sorry get noelor or someone to phone me if there is a problem in future.
Urgh sorry I know what happened I accidentally banned you.
Log has messages like.
Wed 29 Apr 2015 161816 GMT Authenticated Ban.
Where that ban is a hyperlink.
Bans on a GET.
Also that date and timestamp seems off.
Because I could log and relog just fine last night but not now.
You fucked up mate.
I banned you testing it.
That log is from yesterday.
Should be unbanned now.
That log since weird since I had no issues what so ever with mumble last night.
No no the ban there doesn't mean you were banned.
It is a link to do the banning.
It is very misleading.
Oh yes. My normal bookstore has finally gotten Sunstone vol 2. >.
Spider-Man as a teach is like the best thing.
Hm. Might just crack open a beer early. Curious at how that chocolate stout I found yesterday tastes like.
My manager called me Mr Storr earlier and I didn't really consciously notice because male pronouns are sorta background noise but then she apologised and it made me really happy =>.
Wait how am I Noelor that's really confusing.
Hm let's see how this Terrapin Moo-Hoo chocolate stout tastes like.
Chocolate milk stout even. Worrying.
Minister you we're noelor because noelor is currently ember.
Cooked_Auto sounds like it would be quite bitter.
Damn a bit too cold thanks to the fridge to really foam. I keep forgetting that our new fridge is good instead of just middle ground.
No it's a stout not a bitter geez.
It's pretty dark. That's good.
Yeah but adding cocoa which is quite bitter to a beer sounds like you're in for a bitter beer.
I like my beer dark.
Well seems noelor got there first.
Also the mubmle problem has been resolved.
Of course Noelor is Ember because they can't stay connected to save their life.
I wish I could say more about how it tastes other than Pretty good v.
Anathema isn't sure possibly for repeatedly logging in with the server password as my username.
Not that bitter actually. Taste is pretty good.
Slightly dark chocolate-ish in aftertaste.
Last night I received my backer pdf for Feng Shui 2.
Probably gonna let my other beers thaw out a little.
Would anyone be interested in playing?
I'd give it a shot.
It should allow you to play the Revvie-st ever version of Revvie.
If it delivers on its premise.
Well Shadowrun Revvie has two robot arms a troll/fomori for a 'girlfriend' and is employed as a lingerie/fetish model so I'd say I'm going rather well with this version P.
Why is girlfriend in quotes?
It's not really set in stone yet.
In that very wishy washy kind of way despite the fact they're living together.
You mean like some sort of.
Minister i know right.
Also it looks like witcher 3 has a built in cardgame.
Yup always had that afaik.
I know you could play cards in both 1 and 2.
You had a dumb dice minigame in that.
Have not played 2.
There was definitely a card game in Witcher 1.
Famously so in fact.
This is a cardgame with rules that are not fuck all the women.
Not quite the same thing here.
The dice game in Witcher 1 was alright.
ChaosSmurf did you play it to later point in the game ?
I've never got past the first couple of chapters.
Actually maybe I got to chapter 3 last time.
So the quest requires you to defeat higher level players.
And those players basically just cheat.
Their just roll better than you do.
For fistfighting this was alright because you could make your stats better for fistfighting.
You can't for the dice.
Reads linebreaks as finishing a command.
Thats a bit dumb.
And also is designed to never use brackets.
Or well performs the same without them.
Sometimes they can stand in for other syntax.
Though also no brackets or braces.
It is awful to read is what I'm saying.
MoonWolf >complaining about a preview OS being buggy.
Its set to the low update priority.
I should be getting the things without obivous bugs like half your programs don't work when pinned to the start menu.
Nice new bug in windows 10.
The taskbar need to have focus before you can switch tasks on it.
So the first click does nothing.
The second click changes window.
And that'll keep working.
Untill you click a window.
And it looses focus.
We did in fact invent a word for that.
0918 <- do you have the actual tumblr link for this?
Because it is perfect.
Upsides of being an out bisexual. nothing at all half the gay community now also hates you.
SunTiger you forgot and plenty of people will tell you you're a liar.
Meanwhile and I say this to jest rather than complain over here in nonbinary land we're stuck with no commonly-understood words to describe sexuality because it's all about same- or opposite-ness!
Which sucks but sort of expected really.
Language tends to shape around the things that are well common.
When I explained all my stuff to my manager who is the only person at work who knows but she's awesome about it.
I think she sort of assumed being nb made me asexual?
That doesn't suprise me.
For the average straight cishet etc person.
And I was like No gynephilia is a separate thing. I'm just not sure if I want to translate that as straight or lesbian any more.
Sexuality gender gender identity and attraction are all fairly self contained and conflated.
Noelor Sadly only that part.
Today I got my hair cut re-coloured.
It's more red than pink this time but I'm still a fabulous anime-haired thing again.
Tomorrow is casual clothes day at work and I bought this on Tuesday.
I'm sort of nervous about wearing it >.>.
You should be its tie dye.
Wouldn't be caught dead with that.
But it's super cute and purple!
I just hate tie dye as a concept.
I'm not a fan of it usually but this one's a pretty basic pattern so yeah.
Whatever you think is cute.
Right but I am nervous about going into *work* in a pink purple t-shirt.
They handled the hair.
The shirt isn't going to suprise them much imho.
Yeah but paranoia and anxiety don't have to be logical.
I am going to logic myself into wearing it!
But I'm going to be a pangolin on the inside for like the whole morning I think.
Look worst case you'll just be someone who wore a hidious shirt to work.
It is a men's cut.
I was refering to the tie dye not the cut.
I had a related statement.
Which is that I bought a women's cut shirt from Qwertee that also arrived this week.
How does that work on your frame ?
Loose everywhere but the shoulders so the fit is barely noticeable tbh.
Going to try the next size down next time there's a design I like.
Not in an attempt to get away from this topic. but whats the timeframes on Mage/FS2 stuff ?
I have all the setting/hook stuff sorted already.
So I'm going to sit down with FS this weekend and work out what I need to do in terms of NPCs.
Need to find some time to go read fs2 books fairly soon then.
If I can get all or enough folk-to-beat-up built this weekend I'm cool to start chargen next week or the week after if people can do that.
NOTE If you're worried about spoilers probably don't read the comments first. this should probably be on every video on the internet tbh.
And most articles relating to sport or media.
NOTE probably don't read the comments <- ftfy.
Also for getting people on the same page imho it helps to just set a date.
Anyone present got a problem with next week?
Also i think i might be the only one present >.>.
CA was here five minutes ago.
No Im fine with next week.
Peace stalker sounds metal gear.
It is in fact a reference.
I'm the best at metal gear references.
As a side note revegenance is the only MG games i've experienced completly.
In this week's FSN Lancer nails Rin's and Shirou's characters.
He wasn't that dead on in the vn i cna tell you that.
All the tsun's get dered.
Fate path completely skipped the Archer identity reveal right?
Only with retrospects or if you are really paying attention are you going to derive it.
Are there really enough clues?
I think so maybe.
Archer himself figures it out.
Is he genuinely amnesiac?
I've never been sure if he isn't just trolling Tohsaka reflexively.
Tohsaka's ritual wasn't great for the summoning it takes him a while to figure it all out each route.
Mostly they don't figure it out in the fate route because archer stops being there to draw parralels too soon.
Because it's the Saber route.
Stay Night is all about Rin and Shirou/Archer though.
With a sidenote of Rin/Shirou/Saber OTP.
Yeah well nobody uses that.
Even if you are right.
And in heavens feel the game is all we don't have time for this shirou is archer thing and just grafts archers arm onto shirou so he can make with the weapon summong already.
Quality anime subbing action.
Yeah HF is great.
And I use OTT!
But then again I am Noelor.
You are the biggest noelor i know.
Todays SR mission Stealing this from a Zoo.
Why would anyone want to have one of those.
I assumed that as purely wh40k necron like we might be seeing something c'tan consumption.
Oh I didn't realize the armsdealer in AoU was Andy Serkis O.
And the Jackal. An SAS trooper's wet dream of a vehicle. Love that the British Army has never given up its love of rolling the plains raiding everything in sight. D.
Shadowrun update the Dwarf is currently riding an antilope he stole from the zoo and being chased by a police chopper.
Needs a how much does geralts voice sound like snake statistic.
Welp random Serious Sam 3 booster pack on steam.
Turns out I lied.
Walburgis night friend offered me a bottle of rum pretty farcschnickled after all.
Tomorrows zoo will be....Interesting.
I expect I will have a traveling hangover.
A traveling hangover is one that strikes you around 4PM.
Still the best thing.
Goddamnit cap who do you think you are stephen seagal?
Grey is helpful that way.
A somewhat horrible hangover woke up after 5 hours and then rolled in bed for another hour and I must go to the zoo soon.
Can't imagine how my brother feels. He came home about 5 in the morning and is probably now hungover as all hell.
Just got emailed a job ad for a job I'm not qualified for.
Salary up to Â£25000 - Â£35000.
Rather high a range though.
Well no that's the joke.
That phrase allows for any number between the minimum wage and Â£35 thousand.
Which is a long range.
That is pretty standard I get job adverts like that.
Such a long range though!
Oh neat. Chip is working at Volition now.
What did they do?
Well and Conflict Freespace but nowadays they're mostly famous for Saints Row.
Freespace was much better.
Im enjoyimg the SR games.
MoonWolf I have discovered the true endboss of Skyrim. Netch.
MairBear netch are not that badass.
They seem to give no fucks about my weapons and armor and resistances C.
What level are yo u ?
29 I think With upgraded Orcish everything.
Yeaaah betty netches are like level 40.
.....but Netch Leather is needed for armour that's not even relevant then D.
There is a random event where you find a group of hunters who are all we.
're going to hunt netch.
Join up with them.
Oh I see what you did there.
There is netches in skyrim!?
In the dragonborn added solstheim island.
Oh I never went there.
MairBear btw did you hear about the ladder race thing ?
Anathema you missed out on netches and a single silt strider.
And a telvanni ashole wizard in a mushroom.
All my favourite things.
Oh god I want but that price.
Cooked_Auto the models are so gorgeous.
Anathema Dreamforges female troopers are out.
Those are pretty but IIRC GW are a bit anal about using non-GW minis in store games?
It's like 50 to 80% of GW stuff required as a base but of course other manages can be even more anal.
Granted I'd just get the heads or something.
Yeah the heads on scion bodies would look pretty good.
Ive seen a good SoB alternative of using the heavier Dreamforge units with female headswaps.
International Priority 8-12 business days Has Tracking at $47.00 Nnnnnope.
And they're not added to Element Games yet. Oh well.
ChaosSmurf's mum counts from 0.
Based on a recent tweet.
Your mother may be a computer program.
So apparently the Steam marketplace is down and that might be because a lot of the stuff there have been bought up by Russians.
Anathema guessing you were aiming for MoonWolf?
Well saw a lot of cocks today.
Also otters were adorable.
Lions were being more photogenic than usual as well.
Not going to ask.
Just not going to ask.
Was at the zoo.
The local zoo lets peacocks roam free.
Glenn was just boasting about his local zoo.
Don't try to take that away from him MoonWolf.
His zoo can be proud of all the cocks.
I have counted all of the change in the box on my desk.
Roughly 3x as many 10ps as other coins for whatever reason.
Thats not suprising i think.
Anyway I've chucked it all into my bag so I can take it to the bank tomorrow along with this cheque from my b'day.
Time to make mad cash off of your change.
Wait so the gods are visible in tES' sky?
Yes they are the planets.
Or what would be the planets in another solar system.
The sun is a hole in the sky ripped in it when a god sized spirit that was involved in creating mundus decided he wasn't up for it.
The stars are similar holes punches by much less powerfull spirits doing the same.
So... it's explicitly deist?
But I guess the people don't know that.
How does Natima work with that?
The theological arguments center around which gods exist or which gods are the real ones vs interpretatiosn/avatars etc.
I'm not sure i understand your question re natima.
But here have this webm.
Well ignoring how awfully Mair has rolled.
In theory when she prays to Arkay he actually does shit.
But if he's fucked off.
What's the deal there?
He's a planet and everything.
Magnus the sun hole fucked off.
So did the stars the manga-ge although those spirits were tiny by comparison.
Oh I managed to read stars as planets.
The gods exist inside of mundus they are not very hmm active by standard fantasy god terms.
They mostly embody their abstract job.
So akatosh exists and because of that time exists and is linear.
He's also a diety but for the most part the diety doesn't do a whole lot.
There are ofcourse exceptions to that at times.
Arkay and Natima are a bit of an abbaretion that way.
And i wouldn't normally have even suggested that as a OUT.
But its already established that there were 2 other people like Natima in the lore one in oblivion and one in skyrim.
And to reiterate the interpretation part of the gods.
The gods that are mostly talked about in TES are a fusion of the old Nord and High elf pantheons.
They are the gods worshipped in the Empire in general.
And ofcourse also in skyrim and high elf home province in specific.
But if you were to visit Hammerfell or Elseweyr you'd start seeing completly different collections of gods.
You could draw parrelels between some of the imperial pantheon and those gods but it doesn't fit neatly at all.
Ofcours in morrowind they just worshipped a whole bunch of deadra and then later literal incarnate walking the earth gods.
Everyone accepts the deadra exist and is mostly in agreement about who and what they are.
Mostly because unlike the eadric gods.
The deadra show up and do stuff.
Since they are not embodying the world just visiting it.
That's nice of them.
Good old Sheogorath that's what I always say!
Yeah so sheogorath visit the world does things. different cultures have different stories about him slightly different viewpoints.
But the general picture is the same.
Only the conclusions are different.
And sometimes it's Ember.
So some cultures are like sheogorath is a huge evil asshole and some think about him more like a general trickster god with artistic sides.
And yeah Embers ideas about sheogorath are uniquely her own.
Pretty much everything about Ember is uniquely her own.
Those eyes D=.
Why must all bands play at stupid o'clock here -.-.
To convince you to go out and join the party and be down with the cool kids.
1am is not joining the party it's keeping back the temptation to punch drunk people in the face for being tossers with the nordic mantra of drinking until I can't remember what I did is the best way to drink in the world WOOOH!
But still starting at 1am and charging a tenner for entry for the only band is just bad.
A reminder that tomorrow or today for... anyone present who isn't Dob is Free Comic Book Day!
No comic book stores where I live v.
None here either there was an attempt a few years ago but people just went further away to the big posh one.
I mean we've got a book antiquary here but thats about it really and FCBD isn't really a thing here either.
I didn't know swimming anime had a manga adaptation...
Blub blub oh she didn't die blub blub it's like panties blood through nose?
No he's talking about the almost Yaoi one about male swimmers.
Now I'm less interested but still oblivious to what you're talking about so I'll just make due with imagination.
Let's just say it's one of those rare anime that does English really really well.
To the point you pretty go Wait what the fuck?
Cooked_Auto dunno if this will interest you I went to the second hand store a few weeks back because why not and found a copy of OkÃ¤nd Soldat a book I've been meaning to read for a long time due to the winter war and whatnot and with russia having gone apeshit lately I decided why not. Got home and realised it's a 60 year old print <.<.
Third run so there were only 27000 copies printed before this one.
Ok Blook Hulk Pleasure Bot 4000 Iron Man Harrison Jones Hawkeye Garona Black Widow Croman Thor and I guess that leaves some random troll shadow hunter Horde get as Captain America.
What the christ 4chan. These food catpcha are weird.
Oh gods what kind of a time is this to wake up even if I did sleep the full 8 hours.
Today on Solstheim a pile of books.
Everyone of which is either Lusty Argonian Maid v1 or v2.
A shame you don't have the better books textures they'd all be black with whit elace trimming.
I need more mods I guess.
? <- its utterly cosmetic yet i love this mod.
<- lusty argonian maid.
It'd be nice if battle.net would actually let me play hearthstone.
HS is down for the 24 hour ladder event too.
It's been a weird week for HS. 2 days no one was streaming at all other thna some 2400 viewership non-english streams.
And now that we have 4 at once the servers are truly messed up.
Eu servers could not handle the heavy load of 4 professional streamers playing ladder for more than 12 hours.
MoonWolf Reynad was stuck at rank 20 for about 2 hours.
Brilliant plan he had there.
Spend 3 hours to build a slow priest deck.
That doesn't really work against random low level decks.
In his defense every time he swapped to a fast deck he went up against things his preist would have nom'd.
Right now on reynads stream reynad plays random newsgrounds flash games.
Oh god there is a backing chorus in there too.
Oh thats jus the music.
Oh hey finally cardgames on my cardgame stream.
That only took literally hours.
MoonWolf Reynad can be such a happy fellow!
He's actually being pretty reynad.
I ordered Fate Zero off Amazon to arrive today.
It's not yet shown up and I need to go to the bank.
Chances of coming back from the bank to a sorry we missed you card seem high.
Ah well not like I don't have other things to watch.
Almost at the end of tales of vesperia on the crapbox 720 looked at wikipedia and the tales series continues on PS3 and handhelds I don't have anymore <.
Well some of those can be emulated.
Pretty sure vesperia has no sequels.
All of the tales games are their own thing pretty much direct sequels like xillia 2 not counting.
I didn't say sequels.
Well yes but its like final fantasy.
You could emulate some of them.
Thats how I played symphonia.
Dolphin works pretty well there were a couple of parts where I had a noticeable drop in frame rate.
Actually it was a major problem in only one area.
If it's emulated I guess you can just activate god mode if it's unplayable in battle for a while until you move out of the area.
There wasn't even any combat in that area it was just a town with heavy snowfall which for some reason killed my computer.
Nvm after a month of waiting my star ocean the last hope finally started downloading the last 8% at last a forgotten seed has turned up!
MoonWolf turns out it fit through my letterbox anyway!
So it's a good thing I stayed in waiting for it all morning.
Write a letter to royal mail for wasting precious productive time waiting for them.
Goddamnit I cant get that damn cash money from gravity falls out of my head.
Anyway came back from Free Comic Book Day having spent all that money I deposited as change.
MoonWolf turns out it fit through my letterbox anyway! <- hey at least you have it now.
Paid for comics 2nd mathematical volume 1st Fionna volume of Adventure Time tpb of Edge of Spiderverse ie the debut of Gwen Stacey as Spiderwoman Neon Spidergirl Evangelion et al.
I think you might be doing free comic day wrong.
Free comics Avengers ft Miles Black Spiderman Morales Ms Marvel lady Thor Secret Wars and Boom ft Adventure Time Lumberjanes Mouse Guard Help Us! Great Warrior.
What with the money you spent on them.
No see 1 paid-for collection for each free one!
Half price comic day ?
Then I also bought Pandemic because co-op is an important this is a thing board games can do mark in my quest to educate the parents.
Pandemic is 4-player though it's very sad.
Get dob to paly.
There's an expansion that boosts it to 5-player but the 5th is a terrorist.
No see the problem is it's a group of 5.
Because it's my folks and then to persuade mum to play we also invited another couple they're friends with and I actually like.
I'll work it out.
Make someone produce food.
Apparently Munchkin has a comic line now?
Pandemic is pretty good.
Also apparently Captain America is in the Illuminati now.
Oh yeah he was until they wiped it from his memory or something.
It was during the whole planet hopping thingamajig as far as I can recall. He didn't like that.
Still dead as far as Im aware. His brain was used for that whole switcheroo event.
I mean Falcon is Cap now in 616 because Steve got aged up due to some alternate dimension shenanigans thanks to one of the other Hydra guys.
Omg this FCBD Secret Wars deal also includes the English version of Avenge on Titan =D.
This dicussion got very comics very fast.
It was Zola-something. The guy in Winter Soldier the movie.
Oh hey a new episode of plot line.
Wait if Falcon is Captain America.
Does that make him Captain Falcon? =D.
Anyway Captain Falcon to Ms Marvel I have shirts older than you.
Ms Marvel knows more about the history of the Avengers than Iron Man v.
So in this episode of pantsu line the medium is having a date with a claimed gliese...whatevernumberian.
Though also Iron Man isn't Tony Stark any more I think?
Oh no he wasn't an alien after all!
GlennCuttlefish who could have seen this coming.
New inhumans are being referred to as NuHumans.
Also Johnny Storm and Medusa are apparently an item?
Could be Agent Skye and her harem.
Perhaps time travel really is too much power to leave in the hands of a 13-year-old boy and his dog you don't say PB.
Truly worse than hitler.
Good lord feels like I've been whalloped on the side of the head by that beer. But then again it was a 126% Russian Imperial Stout.
Its either that or the post dinner small food coma that I usually get that's slapping me in the face.
12.6% isn't beer anymore it's wheat wine.
ChaosSmurf Adventure Time!
KaunMoth Says 126 here.
Yep that's just wine.
Its in a beer bottle.
You're basically a bunch of farts that were brought to life with some kinda magical spell don't tell me what you doooo! Wow that's harsh.
Adventure Time? oh jeez not you as well.
What? it's rad yo.
Bah. cant decide what to practise drawing on tonight.
A cherry balanced on top of a banana.
Hm. I might end up needing a better display.
Problem with my cheap ass monitor is that it really doesn't show color well.
In fact my TV does everything better than this monitor.
Anathema see my question on twitter ?
Yes I was on the phone to family.
That whole site is so outdated.
MoonWolf it has a TODO and CHANGELOG that have not been updated for7 and 5 years.
Yet the code still gets updates.
Do you know what the version number is supposed to be?
Also no updated binaries around to be found anywhere so you know just build it by hand.
And no i have no idea.
I don't think the author does either.
!note MairBear so somehow after 24 hours of ladder they managed to TIE forsen and savjz and of course reynad came in last.
MoonWolf do you know if is compatible with patternspider?
That thin gis 2 years old.
Well it might be compatible.
But i'm not sure its going to work nicely.
That last published official version is really bad at reconnecting after a disconnect.
Oh well gave my package a new id and uploaded.
Thank RMS for the GPL.
Okay so here is a thing.
I never set up copy actions on building.
So you'll need to manually move the .dll you produce into the bin folder of the patternspider project.
Plugins are .dll files.
Loaded dynamically with composition model.
Dob.
Fuck you poppo you bullying overfuck.
I'm bemused by the Telstra.
ChaosSmurf omg a Deadshot flashback episode really.
It is time!
Chips Watch Dogs LP has been posted.
MoonWolf fun thought being given sacrifice demon by nefarian.
MairBear how is that a fact ?
Oh demonic pact I mean whatever the one that can one-shot a jarraxus.
Bit of rare occurance though.
Entire hearthstone game played before my eyes in the time trump take for turn 3.
Welp that whole match was just whelp.
She really really does.
This cat certainly chose a hiding spot in TSW.
In the middle of a swamp that turns everything in it into some kind of sludge zombie.
Hidden in a box.
Right next to an elite boss monster.
Yeah welcome ot the moon bog.
Good thing I am a blood mage.
Just shield myself up and stroll to the cat like a boss.
And then run like hell.
Yeah not the last mission you'll have to the place though.
Wasn't the first either.
MoonWolf is there a notably superior rework-mod for Morrowind?
There seem to be a few that claim to overhaul textures etc etc.
You can play morrowblivion but i wouldn't personally oblivion engine is not that great to do it in.
You can get one of the complete overhaul mod packs but those are a pain to install and can't fix some of morrowinds fundamental old game weirdnesses.
Neither option is great imho.
But if you insist i'd go for the latter.
Should I just play it as it is then? xP.
You'll definitly hate that.
't have any issues installing morrowind overhaul.
Teehee managed to get one of the guys in the SR group interested in Feng Shui.
Cooked_Auto chip and ironicus watchdogs LP started but I assume you know.
Yeah linked that thread last night.
Which was after you had logged out it seems so.
Wonder if there's an easy pirate of that yet.
So far in the LP I've learned that Watch Dogs Chicago really isn't Chicago and the main characters raspy growling voice is awful.
No no it's dystopian slight future alternative timeline chicaco.
Oh yeah Cyberpunk Chicago.
But the main characters voice is still terrible.
't have any issues installing morrowind overhaul <- Noted and downloadifying.
Cooked_Auto but that would render all Ironicus' Chicago expertise void! D=.
No it mostly entails him But that's not in Chicago!
Game ended early due to domestic disputes |.
So who gets to sleep on the couch tonight?
Hmm.. dark chili chocolate coffee mit cream.
Ok so here's the deal with Feng Shui its entire spec as a game is being quick and easy to get going with.
So how do people feel about just starting on Thursday?
Character generation just being I want to play this character archetype this is my name and my source of melodrama is that X killed my Y.
And NPC generation being what level of challenge is it ok here's your numbers.
Anathema MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish maybe ChaosSmurf how do you feel about just playing Feng Shui on Thursday? this leaves you a few days to do chargen which is as taxing as picking an archetype from a list of 35.
Can certainly see how that works out.
My plan being to finalise character deets get a check-list of why everyone would be in Hiroshima then start in media res starting in media res means I've thrown out the you're all working for the same world-spanning magical organisation angle unfortunately.
Err. Sure but I may or may not need some advice on char creation.
Havent really looked at the book yet so thats a maybe.
Not for me as we discussed I like a bit of meat in character gen.
I flicked through it earlier today.
!note MairBear How do you feel about just playing Feng Shui on Thursday? this leaves you a few days to do chargen which is as taxing as picking an archetype from a list of 35.
Are notes still case sensitive?
I mean Dob is literally the only person whose casing I'm ever unsure of.
So w/e just curious.
!d 1d6 - 1d6.
Noelor>> some inspiration.
Tracer makes me hate my legs -.
First two parts of Baldurks thing for the Watch Dogs LP is up.
ChaosSmurf this week's Gotham is pretty wts.
Noelor I thought they were gonna do something cool.
Like have his wife just go mental.
I mean she could have gone mentaller but.
Cooked_Auto all those weird video effects keep causing fragments in VLC.
That's an intentional effect.
So... it's just awful?
I mean Chip does mention that its supposed to look like that in the commentary.
I mean otherwise just start up the YT version to check.
Have to give it to Obisoft for intentionally making it look awful.
Like most of the game v.
What? It's not like they locked away graphical options from anyone is it?
MoonWolf you should have a standard way of reading settings for plugins.
Well all the plugins use basically the same system but they all use json.net.
And just boring serialize/deserialze.
Was the feng shui set in modern day noelor?
Regular modern day or some sort of weird differen other modern day.
Well ghosts and magic are realy.
MoonWolf yeah but that means they all need to reference json.net! rather than asking PS for settings.
Your characters are action movie protagonists who are in Hiroshima for Some Reason.
Anathema i'll add it to my todo list.
Defence mechanism I imagine.
Also yeah I checked the youtubes.
Actually just looks awful.
When I say modern day btw I mean like... 3 months and 3 days in the future.
The Next tuesday of futures.
Somehow I figured it was that date was already working it into backstory.
See Glenn gets me.
Work it out do a google it's not brain surgery.
No its date math.
I hate date math.
My Feng Shui concept is Johanna McClane I should mention.
I'm making a yakuza goon current or ex named Romeo.
I am building a random generator to make my feng shui character for me.
Also isn't it just a 1d35?
Glenn Making a Yakuza and not taking inspiration from Kazuma Kiryu. For shame.
Yakuza goon seems p great.
Also that leech thing what I want to know what has it been eating or if thats just its organs being regurgitated.
Noelor no thats just i already built the framework for a random text generator ting.
And i'm building a feng shui character one as an excerisize in using it.
Its very easy to make a leech vomit.
Ok MoonWolf whatever you say.
<- its true i made most of it yesterday.
Noelor Oh nothing against that.
C_A who said I wasn't taking inspiration from the yakuza series.
I wasn't. My inspiration so far was actually a song.
Anyway if I know which archetypes you're using I can a make sure you're not repeating each other and b make sure I don't present you with stuff that's too outside competence range and more to the point plenty of stuff that's within it.
I'll probably just use the Maverick Cop outright or something.
Archetypes are there for a reason!
Omg that 2nd schtick.
Does Kaun want to play action movie RPG with us on Thursday?
But thanks for ze offer.
Will I have to study all these factions and stuff for this noelor?
GlennCuttlefish 0 of them.
Your characters unless they're already magical or you have a cool backstory idea have no or only limited idea of all the crazy shit in the world until it starts exploding around them.
Damn you old master stop taunting me.
Old Master obliges me to set one of the fights during a heavy storm.
Let that persuade you in whichever direction you choose.
Otoh I have no idea why the movement schticks have such specific ranges in meters when this game doesn't track movement.
It actively discourages using a board.
It does let you know how fast everyone is I suppose the Speed stat is how far you move in a shot which is this game's tick.
I mean I dont want to take old master but I love the archetype too much.
Oh Maverick Cop means a car chase happens.
You get car chase schticks!
And a free chevvy!
Probably refluff parts of it.
Not particularly. And swap some of the guns too I think. Because me.
You should find the chapter full of gun stuff without too much trouble.
It should be no surprise that's where I went first P.
Just keep the profile of... what is that automatic / revolver / rifle?
I probably mean semi-auto.
Yeah I wasnt going to do anything drastic.
Btw I think the note about the SW including signature weapon bonus is a typo because I cannot find a single gun here that does less than 8.
MoonWolf pull-request in for the plugin.
I'll poke it tomorrow.
About to head to bed.
ChaosSmurf I am loving Hamill in Flash so damn much.
Has he said the thing yet.
That is when I typed it.
!note anathema whats the MumbleCVP for your mumble server ?
!weather remember Burgum The Netherlands.
Was there an exception.
To the debug mobile.
Noelor Ummmmmmmm I have 3 weeks more of japanese classes on thursday so impossible xP.
!weather remember Winchester England.
!weather remember Winchester United Kingdom.
Up for like 20 minutes and it breaks.
I'll fix it once i figure out why Anathema's mumble plugin doesn't want to mumble.
Kinda want to collect Dwarves now.
Actually i think i need to reboot.
!weather burgum the netherlands.
That should have fixed it.
!weather burgum the netherlands.
!weather burgum the netherlands.
Next time i should make sure to put the apikeys right and not have any leading or trailing spaces.
MairBear that guildhest with the turtle is the worst. Half the time the smoke doesn't properly work and then some retard kills the turtle.
No mumble plugin for now.
MoonWolf play dragon consort turn 5. Chromaggus turn 6 mage fireball and pings to make it 6/1.
Then my next draw was divine shield Dc.
Found out why it doesn't work.
When dragon paladin works it's great. But it rarely does.
Yup works fine now.
I do need to refine it though. Think I should remove divine shield which also makes dragonkin sorceror less valueable.
!note Anathema that binding redirect of yours requres there to be a PatternSpider.exe.config present just to convince windows to downgrade FSharp.Core a version.
C_A in this episode of TSW here's this british asshole. Again.
Altho why he speaks with an english accent is a mystery.
Because an english accent is a great way to make someone seem more like an asshole.
GlennCuttlefish so did you finish a route in intoner murder simulator yet ?
For some reason my game gives me a disc read error in one room every time.
Guess i can't discuss this thing that just happened in the LP then.
MoonWolf that's why I added the binding redirect to the app.config in the patternspider project!
GlennCuttlefish Oh him just wait until you figure out who he really is.
Pretty sure I figured it out.
The one who stayed behind.
Yeah but there is more to that.
If there is more I suspect the koyote is involved. Just a blind hunch however.
Not gonna say anything.
Wait why was the tunnel to kingsmouth on fire all of the sudden.
That was not the ideal situation right after running over the zombie bridge.
But there is a nearby mission that fixes that.
And another really great and easy mission too.
Hopefully its one of those two I am thinking of picking up.
One involves a chainsaw.
Oh chainsaw why couldn't I keep you.
There is a chainsaw weapon though later but its like a QL10 special weapon.
GlennCuttlefish your love was forbidden.
MoonWolf Well that was certainly an odd twist in Drakengard.
I think this drink from the power of our ancestors cutscene would work so much better if I still didn't have my hazmat suit on.
Sad part is that everybody on Solomon Island with the exception of your character are pretty much fucked.
And that one lady in her hazmat suit.
Oh and maybe the author?
Nah they're all pretty much screwed.
They've all been Filth infected anyway.
Pretty sure the lady in hazmat suit hasn't. Or the author since he is staying above the fog.
Goddamnit not the mines again.
Nah she's most likely infected too. The entierty of solomon island is above a massive resevoir of Filth. The mine is a perfect evidence of that.
The fog has nothing to do with the Filth in this case that's related to the sword and the draugr.
Somehow this conversation has morphed into a a discussion about someone camptain planet skyrim crossover.
That fight is some bullshit.
The beaumont fight. had to take time off healing myself the second time to win it.
Yeah even I had some trouble with that one with my overleveld character. Part of the trick is dealing with the spawns as fast as possible.
Did that anyway in the last phase. Ignored the dog.
It looks like they were trying for that result though! D.
That doesn't make it look less bad though.
Otoh I'm not going to wait a month to run it sorry >.>.
Go for it xD.
Maybe I can just join up if the plot allows in a month.
I *think* it should be over in a month.
Pending the plot getting completely fucked up or people just generally wanting to play more.
Thats not how that word works Cooked_Auto.
Everyone is gay today apparantly.
Its good to know that Feng-Shui has explicitly an archetype for Kung-Fury the kunfu-cop.
With at least two Jackie Chan references in it.
Its very tempting to run X-COM in Fung-Shui.
Not much to go-on here.
Well then yes maybe.
You just take the basic mechanics rename anything magic to psi.
Pretend the scrounge tech is in fact just high tech.
Which it sorta is.
And play a game of xcom instead of the feng-shui setting.
I mean straight out of the reverse engineering lab.
Instead of cobbled together in the broken future.
A game of X-COM that is not much like a *game* of X-COM but yes.
Cobbled together out of alien bits in the broken present.
Dibs on MEC Trooper for maximum Boosh.
I mean you'd be lacking the horrible random death and all that.
But lets be honest.
So our commander is JadeStar. Big deal v.
After saving and reloading 10 times you're actually playing the squad of guys who manages to beat up 50 aliens against all odds.
I more meant that Feng Shui is hardly tactical cover-based strategy but yes.
Oh t here is an archetype for Dresden Files Murphy too.
She's the cop right?
In fact if you allow sorcerer to be a modern thing i can rebuild like the whole Dresden File cast with these.
Sure though you have to sell me on what sorcery means to your character and how they have/use it.
No that was just general observation that i could.
Not planning on it.
You can also very comfortably skin the sorcerer as a magical girl.
SunTiger Rho Aias =D.
SunTiger RIP Jim Beam.
SunTiger.
Wait what the fuck Thi4f. WHat. The. Fuck.
Wts is this game even any more.
What the shit Th4f.
Have not watched yet.
Psycho-Pass inserting Ode to Joy in German as backing music oh man you so Gen Urobuchi indeed.
Ah so nice random LEGO from dad. And a kit I wanted too for that part.
AH that was that fun.
I think I saw something about that game in the FATAL Friends thread.
Cooked_Auto you got a copy of the Realms of Sorcery WHFRP book?
No I don't think so. Lemme check my external.
Well what do you know. I do.
Can you stick it on dropbox please?
Elegant Saber rolls 18 dice to shoot a bug 75333 59255 12194 394 4 successes diiiiiice.
The winner for last month's poll is cunnilingus I get some fun Patreon backer messages.
You know upon reflection there is an aweful lot of cops in the FS archetype list.
Well it's action movies.
No Old Grumpy Cop though.
We are definitly missing that guy.
<- resonance of fate guns are maximally tacticool.
Friends decided to do a star wars marathon. I thought she hated those movies.
But it's ChaosSmurf's birthday!
Must be a masochist.
What does that have to do with smurfs birthday?
ChaosSmurf loves Star Wars so much the world celebrates Star Wars day today.
Happy birthday btw smurf. I cant find my birthday pictures in the dropbox folder so have this instead.
Glenn Well if she hates the old ones she's a terrible person.
Over here its worldwar 2 was horrible day.
Tomorrow its yay worldwar 2 is over day.
VE day is on the 8th.
I looked it up because I was uncertain.
The original star wars movies were better than I remembered.
Even if the endor scenes drag on way too log.
Too log also. fucking ewoks.
Birthday picture eh?
Well I did find one but I prefer to save that for my own birthdays. Partially because some people could take it the wrong way.
This one. Its my special birthday picture for myself.
Which order was your marathon?
Only originals in the order of release.
If we had the time we might have done the 4-5-2-3-6 thing.
That seems like an odd order of doing it.
Think this is the originator post on it.
I think the logic is something like this Episode 4 and 5 introduce luke as being the protagonist and vader as the antagonist. But starting from 2 we start building vader as this tragic figure whose redemption is the climax of the series.
Also no episode 1 because fuck episode 1 it brings nothing to the table. You can safely ignore it and should do so.
It has some cool fights.
The darth maul fight is entirely overrated.
There were other fights in episode 1?
There's another darth maul fight earlier.
There was? I cant remember it at all.
Gungans v Droids Anakin v Entire Trade Fed Fleet.
Well there was the quick encounter on Tatooine featuring the most pointless sith droid.
Neither of those are good.
Well there is fighting in the palace but that's pretty lacklustre too.
Nope that wasn't firefox.
What did I miss.
Duel of the Fates is a great track though.
That is true. A lot better than the AOTC one.
Yeah duel of fates is about the only decent thing to come out of episode 1.
And fuck 11 year old anakin.
Fuck whatshisname other anakin pre james earl jones anakin too.
Star Wars Pod Racer.
The game wasn't actually that bad from what I remember.
I put more time into that game than any other racer I've ever played.
Damnit steam why haven't you put that one in the sw back catalogue.
I think its n64 exclusive?
Im sure it was on PC.
It was definitely on PC.
Cos I remember playing it at Noelor's.
Rogue Squadron was the best one aside from the Jedi Knight games.
And we only had 1 game for N64 that wasn't Pokémon.
Huh. Guess it was on PC after all.
Rogue Squadron isn't a racing game Cooked_Auto >.>.
No but its still an amazing Star Wars game >|.
Podracing is terrible anyway.
It was a not-great sequence of the movie.
The game was great.
Noelor my last RT.
Is it a patch on Bratt's?
One of the guys I play exalted with.
Apparently has been assuming for the past year+ that I had a wife.
And none of us can work out why he thought this.
You do wear nice shirts for a bacholor.
But other than that yeah.
The best he could come up with was you just seem to have your shit together more than the rest of us.
Sometimes people say that to me.
And all I can think is if only you knew.
So I assume everyone else has the same reaction.
If it's any help Noelor I think you have more of your shit together than I do mine.
That's nice of you to say.
Wts is going on in this bedroom.
4 ikea mirrors that's what.
Omg I just realised they're slowly parting as they extend upwards.
The weirdest thing someone has said to me as when someone asked if I was studying to become an engineer during a stand alone class I took a couple of years ago just because I asked and commented on some space engineering stuff that I had read about.
Ohter than I've just been my old unassuming self vOv.
Nobody assumed I am anything weird ever.
Unless you count jewish as weird.
You're plenty of weird as it is P.
Cant really deny that.
Engineering's not weird.
You clearly do not associate with the same engineers as I.
I was studying Media and PR at the time.
So it felt weird to me.
Is anyone else seeing a modern door suspended over a 3m drop here?
The white windowed one? Yeah.
I assume incomplete or removed balcony could of course be a fence you can't see properly that prevents anything from happening.
Or not by the looks of it.
Yeah I'm assuming removed stairs.
It's just... that's a really modern door you'd have assumed some sort of regulation would have prevented it being installed in the absence of stairs.
Or stairs from being removed in the time since its installation.
Wait a minute...
So what did you now find that made you randomly browse Gmaps? p.
What are you doing in Heaton mate?
Sorry is Heaton not good enough for you?
Do you have do disown me if I move further east than Jesmond?
I'm sure it's lovely.
I expected something more from that.
There'll be plenty of undergrad 2nd yrs around for you to hang out with.
My half-plus-seven is an even 20 now!
I was more expecting It's lovely. If you're a ponce or something like that P.
What is happening is that this is an £80k property and Dob and I currently live in neighbourhoods where you're looking at twice that.
I don't really call people ponces they usually get tosser.
Well I was just saying that as an example.
No idea about the neighbourhoods in this case.
I have no idea who conceived this floorplan.
The double door seems odd.
There are no double doors there.
The ones near the entrance I meant.
That small lobby seems kinda pointless.
Oh as in door - lobby - door - hall?
What you don't have porches?
That's pretty common over here.
It's where you keep your shoes and coats and things.
Granted we have something like that in our house but that small lobby is also connected to a bathroom and another room on either side.
Also lol you should see our property eval we had done lately.
Going to guess I was low.
Though also you're not in a 1-bed flat.
And the door usually stays open unless my brother has girlfriends over.
...how many beds even is your place? 5?
Bow chicka bow wow.
Otherwise it seems okay.
5 beds yeah 1 upstairs room that could feasibly be a bedroom.
Yeah the study's a bed in the sense you're probably taxed on it.
Only got three here.
But nobody's likely to sleep in it.
Even if the TV room is usually used as a guest bedroom with an airmatress unless people sleep in the living room couch.
Like ours is a 6 but that includes Dad's study which again technically sleep-in-able but you'd use the living room first.
Anyway my main problem with the one I linked is having to go through the lounge to get to the kitchen.
When it's allegedly a kitchen/diner as opposed to dining/living room.
Eh I can see that might be a problem.
Here's another single-floot flat plan.
Also the other cupboard opening into the hall seems like it could've been openable into the bedroom instead.
That one seems okay.
Yeah says it's an under-stair cupboard though so might be a support thing.
And I much prefer the second aye.
Does seem to be two entrances to the kitchen as well.
Just so the corridor isn't a massive shaft of darkness or just lamplight.
That tiny double-door isn't a door.
It's a chest-level hatch.
Which is a feature I like but some people may find weird.
Smaller floorspace than the central flat in the film Goodbye Lenin.
Yeah that corridor probably would get pretty dark now you mention it CA.
Bottom of that plan is west-facing.
Of course that depends on window positions but there seems to be an opening in the wall into the kitchen.
Yeah I think it's a doorless entryway from hall to kitchen.
Figured as much as well.
Pale paint helps I suppose?
Throw up something on the wall and it might look okay.
Brb rebooting for updates.
It always pleasantly surprises me when I see some of my scans still floating around 4chan in sword related threads.
Yess my hellhound arrived.
Time to magnetize it so I can troll people with devil dogs.
Anathema are you playing Feng Shui with us currently being me Glenn MW CA or not btw?
Also they totally say I love you in japan.
Or at least in all my Japanese animes.
Oh yeah anime loves the fuck out of which kind of love did they mean bullshit.
Though it reminds me of something one of my brother's friends told me while I was out there.
A romantic phrase for asking a lady to marry you in Japan translates as will you make my miso soup?
IE will you get back to the kitchen woman?
Anyway really? Never once eaten a burrito?
Or really anything tex-mex ish.
Any sort of Mexican food?
I don't believe so.
Never had anything actually mexican.
I mean we usually eat taco during weekends but its not actual proper ones in this case.
Is it just not a common thing in Netherlands/Sweden?
You what i love.
The Redeemed Pirate image.
That weird combination of Chinese Imerial with Western Admiralty thing she's got going is swag.
Yeah she's pretty badass.
Minister I have not yet had time to look at the book.
Knowing the rules isn't mandatory.
I invited Mair after all =P.
But knowing the setting is.
I mean sure you can know about Battlechimp Potemkin and Furious George but its not really that relevant unless you start time traveling and dimension hopping.
Anathema also not mandatory.
I'll barely be sticking to it.
And you're playing action movie heroes thrown in at the deep end.
There will be no time traveling or dimension hoping unless you really really fuck up.
Que us really really fuck up.
And even then I have an NPC in the wings for exposition if needed.
We are actors from action movies?
You the players are the actors.
Your characters are the characters.
It's not Galaxy Quest.
Minister so we are in hiroshima and there will be ghosts right?
Why are we in horishima?
Kain_Spoo yes and yes.
Anathema because that's the setting I've chosen for this story.
The game is set on August 6th 2015 I'm pretty sure it's 6th anyway Glenn can correct me.
I mean why are our characters there?
What your individual characters might be doing there is something we'll establish at the start of the game.
Hm. Johanna MacClane NYPD officer on vacation in Japan with her husband and maybe child. Who are then KIDNAPPED! O.
All right since I apparently cant avoid the old master thing no matter how much I want to my backstory will involve having been a student at hiroshima some 80 years ago.
But because of what Feng Shui is you're disparate characters thrown together by calamity and mayhem.
70? bad at maths this week.
Havent been able to sleep a single nights full sleep since friday .w.
Knew I got that wrong.
CA Die Hard meets Taken?
Also blind since seeing the atomic bombing up close did weird things to his eyes.
Completely unintentional. But a strained relationship with a husband or even girlfriend has to be featured here.
Glenn also gets a =D.
Because he likes what he sees.
Is there a text only version of this book?
No way I can sneakily read this at work.
Well I can't get a text only version into the drop box from work.
That said I've emailed you the backer preview from last year.
Can't promise it'll still work though.
I'll check it out tomorrow.
I invited Mair after all =P <-- |.
CA is that... Fifty with the Buster Sword?
My hellhound that arrived today is the old one with the metal turret and the turrent is glued in place Â¬_Â¬.
Sucks to be you.
Eh I'll just break it off and magnetize it.
This is what pliers and hammers are for.
You could always try the freezer method if its superglue.
Chuck it in the freezer for an hour and see if that makes the glue brittle.
<- turns out this kid is secretly a jojo.
Is there a Bruce Lee archetype in Feng Shui?
Maybe it's road works.
It's still going in broadly the right *direction*.
I had it one time a woman behind me had what seemed to be a schizophrenic argument with herself was painful to look at.
So what would you do if some suspiciously dracula looking motherfucker requested for you to choose between a whip or a sword?
Fear not for there is now a site to answer that question.
GlennCuttlefish this isn't even a question.
But you are wrong thre moonwolf.
If it sa dracula you need a whip.
But remember swords will fucking cut you.
Traditional is not always better.
Cooked_Auto cheers bruv that feezer trick worked.
First time for everything then v.
Good job freezing your tank.
Hah first thunderstorm of the year.
Sound! Euphonium. This week where both the instruments and characters' chests... are flat.
All that Im missing is a melodramatic hook and Im done I think.
Tonight's purchase from the LGBTQIA+ aisle of the flcs a 33-comic collection titled Qu33r.
On the back is a warning that it contains LGBT content.
Is the r sufficiently stylised that it might curve round into an n?
Wouldn't want to buy something without knowning its highly gay.
!weather Remember Burgum The Netherlands.
!weather Remember Karlshamn Sweden.
Also my copy of Captain Marvel v2 arrived.
And I pre-ordered Rat Queens v2.
I could pick it up tomorrow if I were in town but I don't think I will be until the weekend =<.
One thing I know for sure.. CAPTAIN MARVEL WOULD NEVER LET AN ASTRONAUT GET EATEN BY RATS! yeah probs.
That tpb of Captain Marvel included a planet where everyone has to speak in rhyme because obviously a cat containing a pocket dimenson full of tentacles and kittens and Carol teaming up with Santa to beat up baddies.
MoonWolf arena so scary at times D Hand nothing but 5 drops or more till turn 4. Vs a hunter who coined a micro machine o.
Still won but I nearly went reynad at it.
I would probably have just abaondoned that match MairBear.
I am 3-2 so far 2 of those wins and both of the losses were awful starts.
So much hunter in arena.
MairBear not your best run ever.
Enemy had webspinner turn 1 hyena 2 webspinner gave another webspinner and then shot.
Turn 4 beastmaster on the webspinner V.
Will look at feng shui tonight probably.
Anime has ruined us all.
Just a moe crane girl.
And not the bird.
They're a plant hire company that always translates into my mind as cranes.
I'm not sure why but okay.
Also i'm watching jadestar play the most anime golf ever.
Pangya Fresh Up a korean free 2 play anime golf game.
It is the... weirdest thing.
I have heard of this.
I had not untill today.
It is oddly facsinating.
Only anime girls and golf.
Whats wrong with anime and golf.
It has the ability upon starting crash literally everything on your PC.
So in fact it has nothing to do with anime and golf but instead the fucked up cheat protection it has.
GlennCuttlefish feel free to see it in action.
I'm pretty sure I know what its like.
I think I played the wii version at a friends place.
I just did a Glenn and Ctrl+w'd with IRC open instead of browser.
It happens to the best.
Grmbl. hopefully my connection sorts itself out by tonight.
If it turns out there's no game.
I could have gone to get Rat Queens instead and I'll be sad.
And you'll put speakers all over glenn's place ?
Anyhow going away for some hours hopefully my connection will have fixed itself by the time I get back.
Enforced motion blur in games - ick.
Enforced motion blur in games that involve constantly adjusting camera? - Throw up a little in my mouth.
Fuck motion blur in general.
Making players feel sick is not good design D.
Yas the extra days of holiday I bought got added to the system.
18 days left now D.
Also voice acting sins. People who read each line like it's its own sentence. Damn itt FF type-0 I'm trying to like you.
Stop making me hate you.
MairBear move to Cambridge so I have someone to play warhammers with.
Anathema move to Winchester so I don't ahve to move D.
MairBear didn't you in fact just recently move anyway?
So it's Anathema's turn.
Can't argue with that logic.
MoonWolf got to love winning an arena without losing a single minion.
Because the enemy thought they were a face hunter.
Shaman is a subpar arena pick.
When your opponent has 4 attack minions with less than 3 hp.
Don't punch his face for 3.
I mean it is but still.
Also drakonid crushers are horrific.
!hs drakonid crusher.
Ah yeah i'm not a fan.
I'd rather have some blackwing corruptors.
Corrupters rely on synergy though c.
Yeah but they are like fire elementals.
So good at trading.
Almost always 2 for one.
Frostbolt + flamewaker on a shredder it popped out explosive sheep D.
Eh 5 cost I can see myself picking it over drakonid.
With the army underway I decide to finally build a statue. A statue provides the town with an extra 250 in gold each day. According to Morglin in Heroes1 the units that you buy actually wander out of the forest and go live in the dwellings that you make for no real reason. I guess that means that statues are golds natural habitat. I wish I could do sculpting.
Looks like TPB's seeds list isn't updating again.
If anyone's wondering where stuff is.
Noted even if I havent torrented anything in a while.
Is Arrow s3 finished yet?
Couple of episodes yet.
Kickass is so bad dude.
I don't know why people like it.
Where did that comment come from.
I mean the torrent site.
Not the comic book/movie.
Tpb is literally an unreliably piece of shit that doesn't update half the time.
But kickass is bad ?
Kickass's sort by seeds doesn't work.
And it's harder to find a proxy.
She's not goign to be unreasonable about this.
You know whats the best part besides the letter that reads like its from alternate history 1800 ?
At least bi pan and nb folk are safe from her wrath.
The part where she's sueing them to determine if its a sin to be gay or not.
She wants a judge to rule it a sin to be gay.
The even better part of that is.
So she's not even seeking remuneration?
She's doing this on behalf of god and jesus christ.
So apparantly god and jesus christ have lawyered up and are determined to get a judge to rule that homosexuality is a sin.
Except ofcourse this woman is a legal anything.
The kicker of course.
Is not a legal anything*.
Is that I can't honestly say I 100% expect her to lose.
By which i mean no law school not a laywer not a legal aid. nothing.
Minister i don't think this will reach a courtroom.
Just any random part of it.
The hilt on that is the wrong colour.
Is that... a Like Like?
You've surely improved the world with that.
Lets see how many minutes I stay connected this time.
Oh come on thats hardly a maid.
Oh so you are a maid expert now? Know what maids look everywhere? How do you know that is not maid in china?
Also I still think we should play maid RPG at some point.
I know you all want to play little girls anyway.
Don't need a maid rpg to do that.
Man that star wars gay adoption picture makes me more upset than it should.
From what i've read of it it seems like a less homicidal paranoia.
Guess I should start learning their names.
That was the best thing.
I think that was more the result of an intern doing a google search for Technical issues images since it was preceeded by a Simpsons one.
Video in question for those interested.
Cooked_Auto still here they are.
1649 stare <---- ahahahahahahahahaha.
MoonWolf sure is what you want to see when you have 1 life left.
Thankfully he had a very scary opener but nothing to back it with.
So I'm working on my Feng-Shui character generator and I just added a very basic set of possible Melodramatic hook options.
And proceeded to get You've sworn to bring the badguy who is your godmother to justice.
You are looking for your kidnapped secret lover.
Still waiting for it to roll clone on the Loved One table.
<- you can play with it here if you care but it very much Not Done.
Nvm something is broken.
MoonWolf i just went up against the most fucked up priest.
Constructed amongst his cards Lightwell inner fire x2 sylvanas velen faceless thaurissan 2 deathlords velen's chosen Hungry dragon. K'T.
Guess he was hoping for innervate knockout ?
I mean... I guess?
He played sylvanas though when I had a chromaggus.
And then buffed it so that chromaggus would die in a trade.
MoonWolf who is your x type phrase needs a comma at both ends.
Ninja with You've sworn to bring the badguy who is your only friend to justice.
Its a tough life being a ninja.
Karate Cop You've sworn to bring the badguy who is your mother to justice.
The power of random numbers.
Wonder if my connection can handle mumble atm.
It seems stable but web sites take forever to load.
Lets go find out.
Well not showing ping in the favorites menu off to a good start.
Also connecting is taking forever.
Timed out oh boy.
This is looking bad.
FF14 seemed fine just now so this is kinda odd.
It might be your ISP is having connection problems with specific other isp's.
Guess i'll go reset the modem and hope for the best.
So some things could be just fine.
While others are fucked.
I doubt its just to specific ISP's atm no web sites are loading.
Or its just getting worse.
In fact one of the websites not loading is their own.
Hm. odd. phone seems to work...decent via wlan.
Going to try resetting my ipconfig. brb. or not.
Did this die again.
Its..kinda working. for some reason all of my data transfer just stopped for a bit there.
Have words actually traveled from my mumble to yours?
I heard you when MoonWolf thought he heard voices.
But after that I guess not.
God. fucking. damnit internet.
Are people talking on mumble?
I will dance you the dance of my people.
Is my typing going through in roll20? Connection is doing that thing again.
<- alpha footage from the now cancelled silent hills.
So this week I'll be attacked by dice fight spirits in Hiroshima and finally kidnap clones in Richmond. Interesting week.
Meanwhile I'll be down at the pub and just wait for this whole thing to blow over.
I was referring to the RPG sessions I'm gonna have this week.
Kaun is playing some very avant-garde games.
In which he goes to the pub.
Atleast I know the Winchester is loaded.
Should not have listened to dao rap.
Now I want to play DoA.
<-- Krysat using Terror.
But we have a custom playlist when we play DoA with a friend.
Yes people are on mumble P.
Noelor what do I need to create a character for feng shui?
Just the rule book.
The list of character archetypes.
Do I just pick one?
Then decide what makes your version of that character special.
A respect for the concept that moving your plant pot to the northeast corner and the sofa to the west-facing wall will improve the zen.
And decide on your source of melodrama.
BwaS my living room is pretty zen already.
This looks like it takes longer than half an hour.
I don't know how it could.
Unless you're literally going to read every word of every archetype.
Have you met me?
Jks 90% I'll be a Big Bruiser.
All I did was give my Maverick Cop a name and change some guns.
Surprised you didn't choose Full Metal Nutball.
Nah I'd gone with Ex-Special Forces. But Johanna McClane was too tempting.
But here have this SMT thing.
I do not feel very enthused about feng shui.
ChaosSmurf if they have to rename Overwatch following the lawsuit do you think it'll be Halls of the Shootings?
Hallways of the Shooting.
It was aged ago but came up in conversatin on mumble.
Isn't that from some irrelevant company nobody has ever heard of.
And aren't they still releasing apparal with the name on.
Your HotS gets 6/10.
They're certainly still using it.
ChaosSmurf why do you have north korea level internet?
I don't fucking know.
Because this house is a shit hole.
My flatmates are arseholes.
And Steam's a pile of shite anyway.
RPS are censoring him.
And this country is a backward sack of shit ran by and for people who should have died in the 60s.
Yeah the UK sucks.
M8 its all one big happy union didn't you hear?
A union of countries.
Into one big country.
Friday at work is going to suck.
The whole is also shit.
But for different reasons.
That I don't understand.
I have a date for Saturday.
You can complain about the election.
And definitely not drive them away.
Chicks dig politics Noelor.
Dig it out of the ground to be chucked into the ocean maybe.
I lost track of that a bit.
Oh dw she's already expressed her bewilderment at why anyone would have voted No in the independence referendum.
She's a filthy lefty too eh.
Filthy leftie =/= has common sense.
55%+ of a country has no common sense eh.
55% of scotland are cowards or idiots.
The world must be so lovely in black and white.
Also you forgot greedy.
I assume at least some voted out of personal gain.
You should follow Jim on twitter.
I don't think it was a significant number.
Piss jokes scottish fundamentalism video games.
He does the lot.
I get that from sister.
Mate I get it from you.
Why do you need to get it from anyone.
I'm just putting you together with like minded individuals.
What is even going on here.
Talk about finnish politics for a change.
And me being angry that I can't finish writing something and angrier that something else is broken.
I saw a finnish thing today.
I finished something this week \o/.
That your government has a care package they send to every new mother.
We've done that for decades.
It made me want to move there.
My coffee buddy is back in Finland this week work is lonely _.
I am not going to lie Finland is pretty good but fuck the weather.
Imagine actually giving a shit about your future citizens.
Just an excuse to not leave the house Glenn.
+15C all day today.
A twitter-mate of mine recently moved to Asia.
15c is shorts weather.
Because as he put it he could scrape by living somewhere cold or live like a king somewhere warm.
Move to finland smurf around Helsinki area play videogames with me.
No you'll beat me.
Fuck I really want to play fighting games now.
But you'll have really great internet.
You can get good internet here but its going to cost you.
Or you could move to here and get really good internet for good prices and not as annoying language to deal with. Besides I'm sure chicks would dig a guy who speaks english accented swedish.
It is my new headcannon.
Ehh okay 35 is not that bad for 100mbit I guess.
Do I even have to learn Swedish/Finnish.
It will help immensely.
Don't you all just.
That's what I've been lead to believe.
The job market is not very good here atm anyway.
We CAN but in every day life we dont.
Aren't finnish and swedish basically the same.
Swedish norwegian and danish are basically the same.
You're thinking of Swedish and ^.
Don't share a border if you're not willing to be cool about it.
Finnish is more related to hungarian.
Look we didn't ask to be invaded by assholes.
Of those two majority of Finns hate russians more.
ChaosSmurf Finland and Finnish are the Swedish names for those things.
Extrapolate through what you know of imperial history.
Our name for finnish swedes to this days is bÃ¤ttre folk translated better folk. Always spoken in sarcastic tones.
Are you as tremendously racist as it seems.
Finland is probably one of the more racist countries in fenno scandinavia.
Most of the people I know dont really hate Swedes but we hate having to learn the language.
But there is actual racism as well mostly toward dark skinned people.
Glenn Nah Denmark is almost worse.
It's become so systematic there thanks to politics that Swedes are apparently now being called The Decent Ones.
Actually mostly towards dark skinned people and gypsies.
Then again I am hardly faultless in that fuck gypsies around here.
Somalians around where I live seem mostly fine some friends of mine who live in Helsinki are more averse towards that nationality/ethnicity. Because who around here can actually tell one dark skinned person from another.
Anathema so are you playing or not >.>.
Oh nice forgot torrent running in the background was able to finish this OST download while playing.
Seems I missed Ana vs hashtag ge twenty fifteen oh well.
Aww yiss rolling girls songs.
Wait somehow the best song is missing from this and the OST.
Why is it missing.
Licensing or it's in some other release?
If its on some other release I have yet to find it.
So I suspect its licensing.
Oh yeah haven't seen the latest plastic memories.
MoonWolf vs control mech? xP.
His game plan must be control till antonidas and hope it goes perfectly.
That's a case of 1 = 2 that I'd have misplayed.
This guy has seirously fucked himself with that shadowform.
I mean unless he's got velens and 2x mindblast already in hand.
That is to say fuck themselves.
His deck was not nearly agressive enough to make it work.
That was certainly how to over extend into flamestrike.
That was an unfortunate shredder for him.
MairBear wtf is this rogue.
And uses it for trading.
Saved by the power of deathwing.
You know that wolfrider.
That does 3 damage?
And that opponent he had left.
Who had 3 hp?
Would have bee nice to have 3 more damage.
Gun skills in feng shui seem either awesomely stupid or stupidly awesome.
É¼ä»‹ = Little man on a shopping cart assaulting a house.
But what does it mean.
That the thread did not sya.
Noelor nop between gym guitar warhammer and my IRL games I cannot spare the time really >_>.
This is a colour photo of a painted mini.
Could've at least linked the source for more shots P.
I didn't know the source.
MoonWolf dyk the Netherlands Antilles or Antillan Netherlands? still use the guilder?
Aslo Noelor nop between gym guitar warhammer and my IRL games I cannot spare the time really >_>.
Related there was an interview happening on the radio this morning with some people who were in Europe on VE Day.
And the woman they spoke to was a nurse or something and she said and we drove from Belgium over the border to Holland.
And all I could think was Holland doesn't border Belgium you mean Zealand probably.
This is somehow your fault MoonWolf.
I'll take that blame.
Better reaction that Oh god damnit I got from elsewhere.
I am learning about online identities personae.
There is a picture at the start of the section with the caption online identities change for different spaces.
The picture is the front pages of Facebook YouTube and... the BBC iPlayer.
Meanwhile back in the text Understanding how complex your online identity might be is one of the key aspects of digital literacy.
I feel like that's... really obvious to me but doesn't at all explain the issue to people who don't get it >.>.
Yeah thats not a great explenation.
Its better to start with an offline analogues in this case.
Because who you present yourself to be changes from social circles.
Seems par on course with most modern education literature related to IT.
Much like who are present yourself online changes based on where you are.
Well sure that preliminary stuff was dealt with in the previous book.
This being secretly a sociology course and all.
Okay so they should have just referces previous material.
Twitter would have made more sense.
Or eBay which was mentioned in the text.
At least it mentions those. I mean my literature makes mention of Kazaa and Napster at one point v.
Yeah this book was written last year.
And by that means like things to keep in mind for setting up networks and not something that existed in the past I should add.
Fucking Whatsapp is mentioned in this quote.
Your course material continues to be weirdly up to date while also being weirdly just off.
It is the weirdest course to be studying as part of a university degree.
I love it though - it's all been interesting and I'd totally recommend it.
Is Audiosurf 2 really a game that needed to exist?
Its got workshop integration.
And the leaderboards are better.
The picture at the centre of that image seems like the 40k equivalent of a pokÃ©dex entry in terms of numerical accuracy.
THat's from a tg made management game if I remember right.
So numbers can get a little weird.
!note Minister You are playing a Maverick Cop. You are an undercover cop and dread the day you have to betray Pirates.
!note Minister You were raised by Masked Avengers this eats you up inside.
!note Noelor You are playing a Transformed Dragon. You've sworn to bring an Ancient Immortal Chinese Sorcerer from the future who is your uncle to justice.
Squee someone at work said I was looking slimmer.
Goddamn future uncles are the worst.
They do hunt in packs.
Well I might not be improving as an artist but at least my doodling skills are improving.
You are playing a Ghost. You've sworn to bring an Ancient Immortal Chinese Sorcerer who is your clone to justice.
MoonWolf are you going through some Feng Shui character generator or something?
Cooked_Auto i have an important question related to guns.
What is the name of the LMG Hannibal Smith from the a-team likes to use ?
Considering the age of the series I would assume M60 but let me check.
Noelor i needed to do more code to bonsai rather than work on content.
So instead of a random generated character.
I'm now playing Mr Lee.
Nobody believes thats his name but he insists it is.
Also if you need weapon ideas there is this.
I'm fine with this thanks though.
Today's discovery GIMP actually works with editing PDFs.
GIMP... wouldn't have thought that.
I tried Photoshop but I couldnt actually import it because of too little RAM v and I couldnt find a workable torrent for indesign cs3.
Which was my old way of editing pdfs that werent writeable.
But thats shorter than my full name.
Oh yeah I probably should do something about having an actual character sheet.
Aw man I missed racist Finn time last night?
Err. There wasn't that much racism going on.
Well besides me hating on gypsies.
And is that really racism?! AMIRITE? Glenny 2015.
I never said that.
Know who else I hate? Jews. Glenny 2015.
I am perfectly willing to admit me hating on gypsies is racist as fuck.
I expected more hatred towards russians.
Hitler did not do enough Glenny 2015.
Does this milk taste off to you? Glenny 2017.
Hating on pikeys is fine don't wozzle.
They're not pikeys as much as gypsies.
What the hell are pikeys.
I've come to encounter bits of /pol/ in the last 12 months or so.
Just as bad as the stereotypes ?
GlennCuttlefish gypsies that have established a home in the UK and sucking money out of the country via welfare while driving a brand new BMW.
MoonWolf it's impressive how bad they are.
Like all of /co/ and /v/ wrapped into a ball discussing things that actually matter.
//pol/ is what actually ran gamergate.
I like the idea of pol.
In that its a containment board.
IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.
Yeah they bleed into co sometimes.
They bleed into everywhere.
The only reason that bleed into from YCS and FYAD works on SA is because there is a risk of a permanent bann.
Oh lawd that casting.
Mordenkainen's Burning Itch disgustingly common in tieflings. Begins with the genitals taking their own separate prestige class and progresses to level drain culminating with level drain. v.
Melf's Hideous Pustules also known as Vecna's Weeping Ejaculation disgustingly common in halflings. Begins with pubic demons and progresses to genital bursting culminating with genital enchantment. Goddamn Pubic Demons.
How difficult would it be for me to set up a thing that took the HTML of a site.
And saved it every time it changed.
Like a wikipedia revision list but for any site I happen to plug into it.
Say it checked every 24 hours.
Never tried to do anything like that.
It seems like it couldn't be too difficult.
Given Wordpress and Wikipedia already do it automatically.
More things as anime girls.
There is already a tank version v.
Low health music starts playing.
So what would be the 1hp track?
Noelor getting Garchompite is crazy dumb.
Noelor yeah requires you to get 1000 secret base flags.
Mair you missed it all. it was awesome.
Lucarionite requires a win in all 5 top-tier contests.
There were ninjas and shit.
Rub it in >C.
Not much actually happened. There were ninjas. They all died horribly.
Then we went to the hospital and dressed up a statue.
No but they shattered like puny teacups.
Apparently people expected me to play a jolly old kung fu master.
I played lo wang. With all the violence that entails.
I do not know a lo wand.
MairBear>> hmm pretty diverged from mega stones in XY.
They added a bunch you have to jump through a few plot hoops for some but you can find one as early as you can get a bike just glittering on the floor and none of that time-sensitive stuff from XY.
Most are gated behind catching the title-mon.
Old blind lo wang.
Lo wang. Shadow warrior.
<- watch to the end.
For bonus cat.
Hmmm you have a point. Let me rephrase that then. You're an abhorrent repulsive slack-jawed dumbass dragon! Fairies are assholes.
Oh this is rich! You're a dragon and don't know what a faerie is!? On top of being abhorrent repulsive slack-jawed and a dumbass you're clueless and ignorant? Why don't you do us all a favor and just die?
Fairies are MASSIVE assholes. No surprise.
Well shit my character just got licked by a flamethrower.
As a consequence her troll gf is pissed. Things are going to die.
The volume on BBC iplayer goes all the way to 11. v.
Has done since its inception.
Just thought it was amusing.
MoonWolf today is why we need IRL Mind Spider Curse.
And this week in Shadowrun my character almost got burnt to a crisp by a flamethrower and then accidentally flashbanged because seriously fuck SRs grenade rules and thusly spent most of combat slipping in and out of conciousness. And we almost TPK'ed ourselves if we hadn't realized some stuff about SRs rocket launcher rules.
What started with a simple clone kidnapping took a very different turn when one of the BBEGs and a bunch of goons showed up outside the motel room we were currently in.
NO SIR I do not approve.
Wearing a suit over proper office skirts.
What madness is this.
No I think thats pants.
GlennShiro does not apreciate a woman in a suit.
We can no longer be friends.
I still think office skirt is better.
Like a suit is fine but skirts are just better to look at.
Not sure what to do with the CCS.
With 30 points left? Not much.
Dropping the LC down to a regular Commisar is an option which would free up 45 more points.
Lemme boot up battlescribe and recreate that list to see what's available.
2 grenade launchers and a master of ordnance p.
Well there's always two plasmas for 15pts each in the CCS.
Unless you wanna add an HWT for some extra punch.
In 1672 a group of angry Dutch merchants killed and ate their Prime Minister in revenge for him provoking war with the French.
What weapon would 30pt get me in a heavy weapons team? o_0.
All of them by the looks of it. Autocannon is 10 Flakk Missile is 25 Heavy Bolter si 10 Lascannon is 20 Missile Launcher is 15 and Mortar is 5.
What is an astropath?
MoonWolf turn 6 chromaggus play.
Turn 11 it's still alive.
3x consecrate 2x equality in my hand at the end.
Cyberpunk future Chicago everyone is assholes and dont call 911.
Someone remind me did we enjoy the FATE system?
It's heavily improv-based so some of y'all got choice paralysis.
Even Spidey knows that Cyclops is terrible.
Using the Bridge Reed Richards discovered the existence of The Council an interdimensional think-tank and activist group comprised entirely of parallel versions of himself. Sure ok.
We fell towards Doomworld... Towering over Doomopolis was a castle Doom constructed of nothing but smaller dark and twisted castles sounds right.
I was a god says Doom I found it... *beneath me*.
Did that Doom quote come through?
To much doom in that.
Too much doom for my taste.
In the classic Secret Wars.
A superdimensional being ripped a bunch of supers out of Earth into an alternate dimension to fight.
Then Doom consumed its power and became a god.
Drat found a ditto with 3 IVs but they were all the defensive ones.
Pimp it to some Chansey I guess?
I got a 6 IV one.
Yes I know it's almost certainly hacked.
Lol zigzagoon wurmple lottery.
The dexnav is pretty swell for hunting the things while I watch stuff and hatch eggs.
Wooh 6 weeks to download by finally finished 3.
Yeah 4 hours to download 18.6gb 6 weeks to get the final gb because of no seed.
The Dark Id Eh. My daughter has beaten Drakengard 3. She's 13. That's close enough for an M rated game. It's fine.
No seriously its fine. Its just a videogame.
I beat RE Doom Quake and exhumed when I was 12-13 I'm a perfectly normal murderer.
Goat I mean goat!
Yes give me your liver.
Never got that far into Exhumed and never really liked it either.
I didn't have much choice only had a sega saturn and a SNES at that point.
Though loaded and re-loaded were far worse than exhumed.
Ah.I just had/have it on PC.
Here's a character that's a fat guy in a nappie with a pacifier running around killing a crapload of dudes that paint the walls and floor red with blood and his special ability is to fire our homing teddy bears that scream mommy and explode.
Man I loved that old You get one Game and one educational program per month deal that we signed up with at some point because I got so many good games.
Also I will never.. ever.. get the main song from sonic racing out of my head.
I think that's how I got Descent 2 Outcast Incoming at least Fallout 1 Mass Destruction Mechwarrior 3 Interstate 76 System Shock 2 maybe Tomb Raider ShogunTW and the first Conflict Freespace game.
We my mother begged a PC from social services due to my brothers autism got a computer when I was 13 didn't do much but that's when we started getting pc games but at that time I'd broken the record for selling jultidningar and got the star price twice so I got my own tv and bought myself a PS2 and games as well.
My older brothers then gave us Myst and kings quest games as well as RPGs like baldurs gate and planescape wich was awesome at that time.
Yeah I think we got our first computer from the government as well and then dad got some games from a friend aside from Shareware CDs.
The first game I distinctly remember playing as Red Alert 1 and Doom 95.
As in Doom for Windows 95.
Yeah we had a ton of shareware cds went over to stockholm about once every other month and always picked up a gaming magazine for the CD.
And when you were done you started trading them in school for a demo you hadn't played yet.
I can probably finish the first level of MDK blindfolded today.
Oh yeah I did get MDK 1 as well.
I actually have a bunch of playstation 1 and 2 demo cds in the basement.
Have to dig them out one day.
And Battlezone Bermuda Syndrome possibly Red Alert 1 because I have like 2 copies of that on CD Delta Force Land Warrior Die by the Sword Exhumed Incoming MDK 2 Need for Speed 2 SE Alpha Centauri Unreal 1 and Virtua Pool 2.
I played a whole bunch of Virtual Pool 2 I remember v.
I have a DK1 CD next to me atm.
PC and 100% compatible. Windows 95 and MS-DOS.
Refer to reference card for installation instructions. 1997.
And DK1 Gold Classic windows 95 and 98.
Here's something that surprised me I never thought Legend of Dragoon on ps1 would become sort of a collectors game.
Our Win ME home PC came with MDK 2.
I'd never heard of or played MDK 1.
For a long time I thought it was read mock.
Unofficially never really stod for anything.
But yeah I made a few attempts at it and could never get through its opening level.
MDK unofficially was thought to stand for murder death kill by the fans in ye olden days but it was just a couple of letters like xkcd.
MDK2 was made by bioware and good old interplay.
Where as the first one was really mostly known if you had the shareware of it I rarely saw any boxed copies around.
Did someone say sonic racing? Because I think I heard.
I genuinely like that track. Sonic games have surprisingly good tunes.
GlennShiro yes that's the one.
I don't mind the track but I will never forget it as soon as someone says sonic racing I remember it.
Same as I'll never forget aquatic ambiance from donkey kong country because it's the best.
Also water level done right.
Ehh DKC did water levels decent. still a water level.
The best sonic song. Wait what?
Didn't you sea the sign? This is a no Rhino zone.
You get the parrot.
Very well. But this isn't a water level.
Your swordfish is useless here.
I can still throw it at you.
You could but my trusty guard parrot would warn me and I could avoid the sword. and the fish.
Your parrot does nothing but shine a light in the direction you're facing.
And the direction I happen to be facing is the maniac throwing fish at me. Blinding him in this darkness and making him miss.
MoonWolf Teaching children that the world is a cruel and unforgiving place... Such a caring father.
It still flops towards your general direction!
And when you turn around to inspect the flomsplish noise I shall throw another one more accuratly aimed!
Why would I ever turn around I have this level memorized there is nothing behind me that would require me to turn around.
This is a romhack henche the above water aquatic creature.
But in this romhack swordfish gives bananas instead of horrible stabby death.
But the bananas are all black and liquified and you're actually trying to shove them all at King K Rool.
This romhack is dumb.
Lets go play super mario instead.
You load up Super Mario but accidently start Oregon Trail you have died of dysentery.
I'M SORRY I CANT HEAR YOU OVER MY.
I SAID DYSENTERY.
...uncle vash the stampede?
Lemme find the relevant bit.
Oh I had totally missed that Geop is doing a Wind Waker LP.
He's almost 30 episodes in.
I usually don't check the forum itself.
Also any reason why supergreatfriend stopped doing LPs?
He got a job.
I'm not on the forums I just have him subbed and argue with skippygranola at times.
I know he job at 1UP or some place making videos for them. After that I have no idea.
Fair enough any idea who the big quadinfiduple triple AAA game company chip is working for?
He's doing video streams for them now.
Gimme a minute might crash.
Can't actually watch it twitch burns my gpu.
60fps youtube does as well.
I'd get a new computer but the money went on medical bills and paying back friends from saving me from living on the street in london.
Backstabbed by work and the people I lived with.
And I wonder why I keep to myself most of the time p.
Heh I never wanted to share living with people I didn't know b ut being london I couldn't afford not to.
But racism alert they were russian and very ver pro putin and they knew I was finnish.
I was someone to just pay the bills for a few months but I stayed longer so they made things more difficult for me.
Kept upping the rent and bills refused to let me speak to the landlady until I was illegally evicted with a 40 hour notice.
Knocked the door down to my room on friday night past midnight and told me to be gone by monday morning.
And thanks to camerons brilliant plans to not let want any more foreign people into the UK getting any form of social service for housing was impossible despite the fact that I had been in the country for 6 years.
My worst roommate I had when I was at Uni just used my stuff without permission and broke some off it before just going poof and disappearing.
Worst uni roommate I had just woke up at 7am every morning I can't fault him for that he's a morning person but I'm a night person. We rarely ever saw each other excellent guy otherwise.
Yeah I barely had any issues with my uni roommates. I guess I was the terrible one since I was a shut-in p.
Heh I wasn't the shut-in as much as the never-in being born and raised on the island I just wanted to go out and do stuff and meet people when I finally had the chance.
I honestly tried that with going to various parties and such at least a couple of times then I just stopped bothering.
I guess it had something to do with living 20 minutes by buss outside of the city and the last busses were usually at like 1 at night. Or something.
Yeah travel does mess with enjoyment when you have to worry about leaving before anyone else and keep a schedule.
I mean living there let me go to two small anime cons. Before discovering that no that was not for me when I was at older than a lot of the attendants p.
With me it was more that me and my family are rather well known here and I was bullied a lot growing up I just wanted to get away from everything where I could be someone not judged by my family first.
I mean I kinda enjoyed the conventions especially the second one because I hung out with a bunch of people there but at the same time I realized the entire Swedish anime con scene is insular as all hell and way too young for me to feel comfortable.
But hey I got straight A's in art thanks to my great grandmother even when I did fuck all on purpose and had an argument with the teacher about my signature not being creative and artistic.
If you can there's a comic con in london in october.
Yeah I know about those.
I went there last year with Edilith in both May and October and I have a ticket for May but I can't afford the travel.
I guess it'd be neat but the costs and no real income either which means I'm stingy for cash.
So I'm aiming for October this year I'm sure Edface will be there as well.
Even if I have a decent amount saved up. And I've had plans to travel to the Bay area in the US to meet one of my closest real life friends who study there and wont be coming back home over summer.
Flights are about 100 euro return to gatwick and if you don't mind splitting a hotel for 3 days will be cheaper for both of us.
Ah.. which side of US is the bay area? <.<.
I want to say west but I'm oblivious.
He's studying theater there.
Sweet well I hope you get a chance to go.
Yeah haven't really planned anything because Im pretty sure me being terrible at tests and studies will really prevent that or something.
If not I'll just have to drag Edilith over thisaway and have her yell at you then that'll finish your tests and make you travel.
I wish that could've worked if anything.
Actually we've spoken and she wants to visit scandivinavia and finland and whatnots you and glenn included.
Granted there honestly isn't much to see in the town where I live other than maybe some pretty scenery and some boating to the islands.
She wants to come to Ã…land and there's fuck all here except two months in the summer because the government is shite at planning.
Biggest highlight in town is probably the festival in June or July after that its back to boring small town life.
Though I won an argument and an 8 month long planned pun with the red granit here so there's that.
Then again there is always the man city like an hour away with train that has a pretty good Naval museeum and stuff so there is that.
End of June beginning of July towards August is when everything happens here so it'd work fine for her to flop towards your town first.
And yeah Sweden and trains are usually good I know I woke up in Oslo once.
Having had a lot of experience with sleeping on trains and busses lately I have managed to avoid that.
Twice realized I had fallen asleep when the train was about arrive or stopped at my station.
I was suppose to go to gothenburg from stockholm.
But when you travel on a regular basis you get a feel for how long you can kip off for.
A bit of a long trip if anything. Done JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping to Stockholm a couple of times for various things.
Which is a couple of hours of travel and at least two switches.
The worst trains I've been on are the welsh ones 5 years ago.
Still running the same old ones from 1976.
Took 3 and a half hours to get from Aber to Birmingham.
And if you were on the wrong end of the train then yer fucked because the train split halfway through and one half went to birmingham and the other to north wales where you'd be murdered and then forced to shag a sheep.
Oh that happens on the train to MalmÃ¶ from where I live. I always tend to be paranoid about it.
I freaked out first time I came across.
Got to birmingham international just fine train towards aberystwyth the sign said. an hour later *conductor voice* OPÃ–HIRD9PS7BNÃ– ABERYSTWYTH DSLKJGNPÃ„SINGOÃ„IS TELFORDDJ SALKBLÃ–IKUDBFS----DRAI.
What the hell!? I heard aberystwyth started asking around realised I was in a carrige with freshers and no one had a bloody clue.
And now I can't help but to imagine Edi looking bewildered once they start talking over the speakers on the trains here.
20 minutes later the drinks cart came through and all of us stood up and asked WHERE DO WE NEED TO BE TO GET TO ABERYSTWYTH!?
Then one older gentleman in the back who later turned out to be my comp sci teacher started laughing stated that we're all fine.
He'd get on the train every year before uni started just to watch the freshers coming in from birmingham freak out.
And Edi would be fine she speaks english and welsh and if anything goes wrong she'll jump up and bike you in the knee.
Well yeah but she'd still look bewildered once they started talking in Swedish over the train speakers.
But knowing her she'll probably pull a bike out of nothingness and twat you with it.
Its only occasionally on the train to Copenhagen that they talk in English as well and I think that's the later day ones too.
No I know what she'd do she'd record the fucking thing and make me translate it.
And take pictures of everything and say You speak moonlanguage.
Oh god she's going there solo?
She went to Poland solo for a wedding and was fine pissed of her face on pre-reception vodka but otherwise fine.
Granted I've walked around in Prague by myself without issue.
Yeah you make yourself more of a victim by looking scared and lost.
Though I might be wrong acording to the internet when mayo is a gender.
Argument on facebutte about old cartoons when more things were allowed.
And now today you're man woman undefined gay not gay but maybe cisglÃ¶jsaÃ¥Ã¤oibnfpÃ¶ioaugÃ¶ofskjgÃ¤opdisnfoÃ¶sinoisdnÃ¶dlkjnfdÃ¶lkgfdnf. FUCK YOU TRIGGER WARNING YOU GAVE MY CHILD AUTISM BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED VACCINES AND THE ANTIAUTISM VACCINE CAUSED AUTISM.
Everything is just.. the fuck happend.
But why did they get such a bloody presence if they're a minority?
Because they are loud and therefore noticeable.
Because reddit of course.
Well social media in general.
I mean just take a look at how much missinformation is being spread on tumblr despite countless corrections. If you're loud and presistent enough in today's social media society you will most likely succeed.
Fuck you for being gay and not cis you cis gay cis what.
More like Fuck you for not agreeing with me.
Ok so there's two things going on there.
One is I don't like being labelled which is perfectly reasonable especially from anyone marginalised by labels.
I have an aquantance from uni who in uni was gender confused she was/is a she but now is maybe a man. Two years ago she was he but now she is It this thing that exist between genders because IT cannot decide.
The other is I'm not 'cis' I'm 'normal' which is awful.
And she/he was such a nicer person to talk to before she/he discovered these people.
Gender's p bullshit though yo.
Like can't decide is a flawed description because it assumes there are only two.
If there are any genders there should be infinite.
Well from a biological perspective there is two. From a psychological standpoint things are different.
That's not even true!
Sex isn't binary either.
Does any of you remember Norse from WCradio?
Err not really. Purged pretty much all of that.
Fair enough he's a brilliant guy but I was the only one who knew that he was a he.
And that was after 2 years of speaking with him he was born female yadda yadda but when it came to sex he was asexual. Fair enough.
What my worry is when you identify as wolfkin.
The first is an animal the second is a plant.
I mean if someone identifies as wolfkin and therefore tries to eat your face fair enough.
That's something you can complain about.
But otherwise why would it even affect you enough for you to care?
Hm guess I never thought that far. I don't mind furries or roleplayers I guess I worry over nothing that would ever affect me personally but more about people who genuinly believe they are of another species trapped in a human body.
It goes beyond gender confusion and becomes species confusion.
But I do like prodding at peoples brains to see what makes them tick.
Ah well I'm sorry if I offended anyone I genuinly am.
I work with proper Northern men.
I'm just gonna keep mum because I know it won't click with everybody.
That's all I'm gonna say.
You're not going to cause any episodes =P.
No but I still don't want it sour anything.
Seriously there's a guy at work who deliberately says bigoted shit just to get a rise out of me.
The worst person I worked with was my old boss who claimed that Croydon was nothing more than a crack den filled with retards and rejects while he was trying to get the council approval to open part of the school there.
He's from Barbados studied in America and looked down on other black people for not being as good as he was.
The only backtalk I really remember from when I worked at the warehouse that handled wood floors and suc was about the other workteams P.
Friendly banter or christs diper?
I got work for this summer as a chef and the menu is all mine 3.
The more Why the fuck can't they do their damn job kind of banter p.
You know the usual stuff.
The best job I ever had was working night from 8pm to 8am.
Worked 2 days a week and was paid 250 euro under the table.
And when the place closed down staff was renamed to the drain as acording to finnish law any business with an alcohol permit has to dispose of all alcohol down the drain.
Granted I've worked black once. Helping a friend of my mom paint up some place they were going to sell. Nice and easy work. But that was a couple of years ago now or something.
Here at the moment on the official gov site there are 78 jobs listed.
I havent looked for a job since I began the Datacom course.
40 of them I can't do because I don't have the education for it.
Then again I didn't look for much before that anyway >_>.
Oh not having a go or anything I take a black paid job because why the hell not.
Here with such a small community you're bound to.
In my case I've only really gotten jobs through my dad and I'm practically seen as a regular at one of the warehouses now p.
Lesse 65 jobs in the town I live right now.
Most of those are sales jobs. Fuck those.
Others are nurse jobs. or teachers.
About 35 of them here.
My ex is a trained nurse but even she has difficulty finding a job in that field due to union.
So she went into daycare instead.
My brother is working as a temp teacher at the school my mom is working at. Usually filling in her class even when she's away because she's studying to expand her field a bit.
Lesse what else is there available. A cleaning job or a chef job at a Nature park and restaurant.
But pretty much jack all I can do v.
Same as most small towns I'm getting a chefs job because the owner is a friend and knows my cooking. Otherwise I'd take a sailor job if I pass the physical.
Though I'm still tempted with the sailor job 4k a month.
Yeah with my handicap that wouldn't happen.
If anything that place is fucking delicious.
Granted you need a car to get there but still. Also a nice way to see some wildlife.
I don't have a drivers license <.
Probably not get one either because I don't trust myself behind the wheel.
Are those boars just for show or do you get to eat them too?
You can eat them.
Their Visentburger was fucking delicious last time we ate there.
Wild boar bacon is the best bacon I.
<- What I'm gunning for in the long run if they get back to me to say that I don't have to drive just be avaliable to help around the island.
Here's their Lunch meny.
Oh that's a nice menu.
Can't really seem to find their proper menu though.
Heh I went to the store yesterday and asked if they could get me a chicken a whole chicken to roast in the oven. Their response was Well we have marinaded ones No I want a fresh whole chicken! Oh.. there's frozen ones I want fresh! Just give me a live one and I'll gut it myself..
The marinaded ones are so pumped full with water it's almost illegal.
THis is the food court at the Uni I'm at twice a week.
Speaking of Chicken I had that place's Spring chicken this wednesday. It was kinda weird since it was like a club and a piece of breast with some carrots and sauce.
My school was always good with food even with my allergy when I was the only one of 500 kids they'd take me aside and ask what I'd want and then contact my mother to make sure it was okey for me to eat.
Speaking of chicken my girlfriend in aber decided to bring home two pheasants from the butcher one day a cock and hen fully fethered and innards still being innards and not outards. Without telling me just plonked them in the fridge.
During my Uni years whenever I was on campus I always ate at the same sandwhich place because my god was it delicious.
Granted I also tended to eat alone but that's what music and books were for P.
Two days later I decided to ask her what the hell was in that one plastic bag of fethers and legs and she told me pheasants.
Now great chicken once plucked and gutted can last about a week fresh.
Not when they're featherd and their innards still being their innards.
Two days with livers and kidnes shot with ball baring is quite a lot for fresh meat when the coat that keeps them warm is still there.
So on a sunday morning I take these birds out of the fridge and begin plucking them cup o coffee on one side of the kitchen and bin bags all over the floor maybe there's something to redeem but I better do this properly.
So pluck them down the chest like grandfather taught just to gut em and while showing her how to with a 3 day old bird that you should have plucked 3 days ago skin far too loos.
Right the hen was alright after much more work than needbe it was plucked and gutted with the good innards in a pot for stock the cock however.. smelt to high heaven it has been shot through the liver and the kidney and the stomach and begun rotting in our fridge as soon as I opened that poor birds stomach my girlfriend learnt her mistake.
You get a pair of fresh birds from the butcher still fethered you eat them that day.
Or if nothing else you tell your bloody boyfriend that you have them in the fridg.
So yeah pheasants are really nice if you prep them when you buy them and then put them in the fridge not as much if you leave them in there for a few days.
Heh I remember growing up asking why there were always hooks hanging from the garage celing at my nans place until my grandfather deemed me old enough to know that he shot deer and other animals and hung them indoors to mature.
After that he just didn't give a shit yeah there's a couple of rabbits nailed to the tree in the garden.
That was pretty much his train of thought after that then he lost his fingers.
He lost his fingers because he was an idiot.
-26 degrees outside and knocked the cover of the motor into the sea better try to fish that out with my fingerless woolen gloves.
Come back home 6 hours later with frostbite and the wool completely shrunken around it into the skin welp.
Lost 8 fingers felt completely inadequate as he couldn't provide meat for the family anymore stopped fighting cancer after being in surgery for 12 times and died.
Now haunting my nan at their cottage.
Cooked_Auto looking at your school menu next week coq au vin hopefully yum.
Heh probably not during a day I'm there since I only got classes on Monday and Wednesday. Tempted to try the burger though just because.
Also bluecheese zucchini with fried rice is something I want to try.
So I moved all of my webms from one file to another. And on the list I spotted angry lesbian noises.webm.
It wasn't as bad as I thought...Well depending how you look at it. It was cross ange.
Why do her breasts glow.
Also there are no noises.
Whats even the point without noises.
You cant actually hear the angry lesbian in the background I think.
Also why her breasts glow? Because you cant show tits on tv.
Its okay we can have this show that frequently involves rape sexual abuse in general and lesbians all over the place.
But we can't show NIPPLES.
That would be TOO FAR.
Thems the rules I didnt make them.
If it was up to me they could show nipples as well.
I won my first real game of 40k \o/.
Other guy had an all terminator space wolf army which in 1k points meant like 15 guys.
He didn't have an army.
He had a squad.
One unit of veterans outflanked in their taurox and came on the side of the board right beside a squad opened fire with plasma and las and left only the champion who I think was some special character left.
Still would have killed my 1000 point army without a wound probably o.
Guy charges on his turn overwatch takes a wound off then he gets clubbed to death my guardsmen.
Then that squad got oblitered by psychic powers and missle launchers.
But my grav-chute insertion team managed to not scatter! and landed right next to his guys who had the objective! and 2 flamers 1 heavy flamer and a demolition charge killed all but his Rune Priest!
Basically he rolled lots of 1s for saves.
The entire game hinged on whether or not the veterans could take off the last wound of the rune priest in melee.
And they managed it!
Tldr don't underestimate bayonets.
You bayonetted a bunch of space marines to death.
How does that even work.
Were they power bayonettes ?
How doe they get through marine armor ?
Through the joints obviously. But the more you think about how things work in this case the bigger headache you'll get.
MoonWolf space marines in terminator armour*.
They were space wolves though so they probably weren't wearing helmets.
Sigh not taking bookings over the weekend stupid fancy burger place.
Mewnir the name of Cat Thor's hammer.
Man restaurant reviews are funny.
Woman gets annoyed after a waiter becomes impatient I phoned ahead and mentioned I was gluten free and had a special diet. I checked that everything was cooked fresh and I could ask for some things to be missed out of my meal. When we arrived I told the waiter that I was also cow's dairy free and tomato pepper and aubergine free.
Should not have left this to the last minute.
I never claimed to be good at making decisions!
My backup restaurant doesn't open until 6 though I should be OK.
What exactly are you doing?
Trying to book a table at a nice restaurant.
In Cambridge the first saturday after the tories won an election.
Well at least you aren't trying to do it tomorrow.
Except Labour won Cambridge and the Conservatives were nowhere.
BwaS they won the city the rest of the surrounding area is firmly tory.
Fucken 28% majority in the area I voted in.
Mm but I'm sure Cambridgeshire has restaurants too.
No one wants to eat in some swamp restaurant man.
Some people do want to run around in their underwear and that's great for them looking at you Emma and Namor.
Hooray got a table at my favourite indian place.
Anathema ChaosSmurf BwaS I have a new phone! 07480 894 794.
Is it fancy ?
Noelor do you have my number.
If so text me.
If not I'll get it later.
Thanks to google yes I do.
MoonWolf it's moderately fancy.
White instead of metal though with a blue trim which wouldn't be my choice but was all they had in stock.
It's bigger than my old one but not iphone huge and is new hence faster.
Need to get an SD card to expand its memory if I want more than a handful of albums' worth of music in it though.
Main thing is my monthly contract payment went down by over £10.
Haven't let me down yet.
My HTC last for like 5 or 6 years without fault and I only replaced it because it ran out of space and couldnt upgrade the OS.
ChaosSmurf genuine quote from my facebook feed Conservative voters are merely a sympton of the social malaise of conservatism and a mainstream media that panders to whatever they think will generate more sales integrity be damned.
He doesn't seem like the worst human being alive at all.
Mairbear I have a new phone! 07480 894 794.
If I had your number before I still do.
Just need to find my phone.
Because my contacts were saved to my google account rather than my SIM.
FF6 update I lost the world blew up and now I have to climb the cliffs and throw myself into the ocean.
Another successful night of playing videogames with a friend.
I think I might have actually lost tonight.
I wasn't keeping score.
I never do. But I lost quite a few matches.
Pretty sure friend won at least UMVC3 and GG XRD.
Not sure about DoA5U.
But hey at least he liked the grub so thats a moral victory.
We had chicken filled with pesto and not-quite-feta cheese and duck flavored instant noodles with egg.
I just had BBQ today.
Only problem is that tonight cost me about...33 euros? Will seriously have to bum a bar night from the friend on a month or two.
FF6 update I lost the world blew up and now I have to climb the cliffs and throw myself into the ocean <- this is the brilliant part imho of that game.
You don't stop the badguy.
The bad thing happens.
Then Celes tops herself.
Help rebuild in the aftermath.
Because of how bad she fucked up.
Finally some project titan gold to be able to purchase a hero hmm which one.
That one's 10k tier I'm afraid.
Would rather not play a support class role like that in a game like that you get mauled if you're a rookie or playing for fun or playing to beta test.
Emperors new groove was better than I expected.
ChaosSmurf HE FOUND THE BATCAVE.
ChaosSmurf What kind of insurance? The ATOMic kind Felicity why.
Oh turns out FF6 also has a permadeath.
GlennCuttlefish dyk I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying is back on?
Om nom nom.
This Inhumans arc in SHIELD is all well and good.
Except for the part where the best Inhuman is missing.
The 'all well and good part' yeah don't really agree with you on that premise.
I saw an improve play last night was pretty good best bit was you want to sell your son to a madhouse? why? well he's clearly mad! what has he done? *the son* I'm just going to go and vote conservative.
The horror... The Horror...
Oh lawd this is good.
Noelor what's the I in LGBTI.
MoonWolf Have Zorak and friends playing 13th Age.
These are going to see like fucking hotcakes.
Stripped my ebayed baneblade of paint there sure was a lot of warnings on the bottle of the thing I used.
Its pretty agressive stuff.
'if it gets in your eyes call a doctor immediatly do not breathe in use in well-ventilated area avoid pro-longed contact with skin'.
My throat is a little raw even though I wore a respirator must have been left over fumes from when I was done.
On the plus side its also been stripped of any paint you might have breathed in.
Still cannot decide on a colour scheme for my shock troops though.
Yes we've finally moved onto non gimped saber.
Anathema Just use Simple Green or some other UK equivalent to that actually. Lot easier and healthier.
Which is apparently Dettol. Also Green Soap works wonders even if its a bit slow but it will pretty much remove all paint except the basecoat and plastic and strip everything of metal.
Took me embarrassingly long to do 1st time setup of irc on new phone.
Its not that hard.
MoonWolf I managed to forget this server was .com.
Unit 21.3 Citizen Media and Cyberactivism.
Sometimes my sister is such a disappointment my ME3 copy is for wii u.
I didn't think console porting went that way.
I'd be disappointed if my relatives owned ME3 as well.
Bah. I have the motivation to practise drawing but I cant concentrate worth jack today.
Draw smaller things ?
I wasn't exactly working on anything major so far.
Ended up doodling a dumb looking turtle. I dont think this helped me improve at all but at least time passed.
That's all that counts.
Jesus christ nature WHY.
Don't believe its lies.
I don't know it looks legit.
Legit like a moth or legit like a wasp.
Damn you've got me there.
Urgh wtf body do I seriously have another throat infection |.
Would way prefer this to be from inhaling noxious fumes.
Hearing the sound of running water when walking by the kitchen home alone I stick my head in to find no taps running but instead about 10 or more wasps buzzing to make that sound D.
Murder every single one of them.
I'm not going in there.
Somehow this series is going from rampant fanservice to ghost trick.
I have performed my manly duties and assembled a grill.
What is even going on in this house.
I blame dad. He just called and went Alright there's a new grill in the garage I want you to assemble before wednesday. When and why he bought it is still a mystery.
Cousins dogs were here for a while I lock myself inside my room. At some point I think maybe I should make some coffee... and some poltergeist opens my door at the very second.
Your dads a little weird.
When I leave my room cousins dogs have somehow been replaced with my parents dogs.
MoonWolf No he just thinks of really odd times to replace the old grill.
Oh cool this showed up again.
Elegant Saber rolls 19 dice to shoot bugs 53554 106633 25151 2521 2 successes.
Did you hit the bugs?
No I did not.
Must not be normal bugs.
I think they might be void bugs you should kill them.
They're wood elementals yeah.
Well now this is certainly... a species.
With those proportions the head looks upside down.
Hm. Igavania might actually pass the kickstarter.
Around 110k to go out of 500. Launched...Some hours ago maybe?
Pretty sure that's exactly what they did MoonWolf yeah.
Some metroidvania streams happening today if anyones interested.
Darth Arho? That's a pretty stupid Darth name. Where's the ridiculous naming scheme we all enjoy? Darth Poysan Darth Dedbabi anything but Arho. I guess Oliver Queen turned to the Dark Side after all.
Here's another thing I have to share every time I see it.
Noelor you don't HAVE too.
I've not even seen it yet!
And I wont for a while.
But it has cuttlefish.
I might watch it once its on dvd.
Well I say dvd.
But I mean high quality rip.
I am serious. Well okay a mention of cuttlefish. But still.
Apparently already funded too. So well done I guess.
Hm pity that's more the classic design than the MCU one.
One of the guys is talking about a game called Goblins they played.
There was this really scary turtle right.
Also my SR GM mentioned that this week's game might appeal to me. I almost dread knowing what he really means in this case.
Weren't you hospitalised last session?
No. Managed to heal that during downtime.
Huh my first free pack contained a legendary Cenarius.
And all my disconnects were down to my own stupid net I think.
Oh so they revealed who Female Thor was. Huh.
Was it as underwhelming as everybody expected?
Eeh can't say for sure.
Blizzard gave me 120 free dust.
!note MairBear Blizzard give me 2 packs to apolgize for bad network performance. can't get into a HS game.
Grmbl will I have to start melatonin in the mornings or something.
Because I keep waking up too soon.
And then I cant fall asleep again.
TOO SOON! YOU HAVE AWKENED ME TOO SOON EXECUTUS!
I think the last time I had a good nights sleep was around 2 weeks ago.
I am intrigued. Tell me more.
You must find out the rest for yourself.
Ffffuuuuuck its a vita game |.
Emulate a vita. Good luck with that.
Don't think those exist.
I cant stop listening to some stupid video game music/rap mash up.
Some quad cities djs mix?
Its note even very good.
Cant decide if I should take another cup of coffee before I start drawing or not.
GlennCuttlefish your langauge is silly.
List is missing the longer version of no. nii. Which is no. nii. nii. no.
It gets even funnier if you add random -sans to the nii's.
Then it just sounds like a rape doujin.
Goddamnit I forgot where I put my pencils while I was reading that.
Let's learn more about hacltivists!
I'm sure this book will be very capable to explain the idea of hacktivism and the way its just a giant grey morass.
It's actually more about the Arab Spring Occupy and the like.
But that's less amusing =P.
Yeah it's cyber activism.
Hardly the arab spring wasn't cyber antything besides cyber communicated.
But everything in society is that now.
Apparently in 2004 Spain's government was led by the Popular Party.
I didn't choose the title yo.
Yeah well its a bit silly.
Its like calling someone a cyber criminal because they used internet banking to look at their bank account.
You would have had to see the original in person to really get an appreciation for how bad it was. It looked and felt as though it had passed through a plaguebearer's colon on its way to my painting desk.
New phone means teaching it all the English slang like that again!
And hopefully it won't turn out quite as gutter minded as the last one ?
It's still me using it after all.
Photos of people in V masks.
Sorry that was a sarcastic cool >.>.
Typing is very slightly different on this phone.
Probably just because it's a couple OS upgrades later.
2nd picture of people in V masks. Paragraph above In addition you might be interested to know that the mask is the trademark of an activist group caption How to protest 'Anonymously'.
Wasn't all that clever.
!note MairBear pretty 'nids.
SunTiger they've also explained what a internet meme is!
Did they feel the need to invent any new words for that like say thought germs ?
Maybe mind parasite ?
I specified internet meme =/.
Also no because inventing new words for things is somewhat antithetical to the point of educational material.
Also also you're still way too upset about that =P.
I'm exactly as upset as i want to be.
Why are you so upset moonwolf? Did people meme on you too hard?
Did they pronounce it 'me-me' instead of 'gene with an m' ?
Cgp grey explained the concept of a meme the actual original meaning of that word without ever refering to it by that name.
Instead prefering to call it a thought germ.
I hope they called it maymay.
GlennCuttlefish is the worst.
Hey hey! say say? Mayday may may! yay yay.
No nii nii no.
Signs I've been practising too much on a computer While making mistakes I keep reaching for ctrl+Z instead of the eraser.
Try writing ctrl-z on your eraser.
I did not put cheese in my lunch today.
That was a mistake.
Anathema can't operate at 100% without cheese.
Taylor Swift sings about lips a lot.
I underestimated the amount of additional nuts I would require.
I'm not sure what to make of that.
Ministry she likes lips ?
Sorry clarification about her own lips.
She's a lip person.
There's just a lot of lyrics about how red her lips are.
Obv euphemism for aroused vagina.
While Anathema is about as subtle as a brick.
How long have you known me?
Red lips are a good sign of feminine sexuality.
I can't think beyond the obvious atm.
Idk why it bothers me either.
I'm well aware that she's... limited as a lyricist.
Because you're human and your brain noticed and trend and then immediatly jumped to WHAT DOES IT MEAN.
Yeah but you're not a famous pop-star either.
Though I also don't have any melodic ability.
Whereas T Swizzle is p great at the actual music part.
Dont worry neither do famous pop stars.
Ministry really. T Swizzle...
Which is arguably more important.
The longest track name in my music collection is The Dreadnoughts - Legends Never Die #06 Mary The One-Eyed Prostitute Who Fought The Colossal Squid And Saved Us From Certain Death On The High Seas God Rest Her One-Eyed Soul.
Should have named it in a language with logographs.
Japanese or Chinese or what have you.
It being sung by a canadian folk-punk band this is not likely.
My longest is Bal-Sagoth- The Splendour Of A Thousand Sword Gleaming Beneath The Blazon Of The Hyperborean EmpirePart.III I think.
SunTiger almost as good as.
Red Sparowes - And by Our Own Hand Did Every Last Bird Lie Silent in Their Puddles the Air Barren of Song as the Clouds Drifted Away. For Killing Their Greatest Enemy the Locusts Noisily Thanked Us and Turned Their Jaws Toward Our Crops Swallowing Our Greed Whole.
Knowing Anathema this is a 15 minute atmospheric track.
No lyrics. no real beat lots of chirping noises.
Actually that one is 142.
So a lot of chirping and some buzzes.
Anathema i didn't realize they made atmospheric that short.
Well the air is barren of song.
Still recommend this album.
Other than that the shortest trackon that album is 7m.
At this point I have no idea what is the longest song name in my library.
I don't really listen to bands and genres that go overboard with the titles.
I found it for other reasons because i was scrolling through all my music.
And its name was longer than anything even came close too.
My foobar doesn't even display full track names by default if they are too long.
Post-rock is best rock.
And then foobar puts on one of my longest non full album mixes. Which is just 42 minutes of Skyrim atmosphere music v.
Cooked_Auto this name is very much an exception for the dreadnoughts.
Whats wrong with that name ?
It's just a pretty genrefying name.
But they are a prime source for music about poutine getting drunk sailing and polka.
I mean maybe not the poutine.
Until you specifically told me they were Canadian.
Its a song about a mans crippling addiction to poutine.
Dunno if Quebecois uses a different adjective.
Man I want to try poutine.
That is not what i wanted to paste.
Praise the Splayd!
Thats just a very awkward fork.
I agree with SunTiger.
I have emoji in hexchat now.
Yeah that doesnt seem to be supported on my end. All I got was a square.
Go into preferences advanced add Segoe UI Emoji as the second entry in the alternative fonts list.
Can't tell you for other clients.
No idea if I dare updating mirc.
<- you can get that font here if its not working.
Already got it apparently.
Yeah its a regular windows update.
But not all people are uhm good at keeping up to date.
Got it listed in IRC fonts as well.
If you just added it.
Nah its been there for a while now I think.
Well its working for me â˜‘.
That's how that looked for me now.
The irony is that to me what you copied is still what i put in.
You can't display it.
But you can move it around just fine.
Ministry connection being wonky ?
I saw what CA sent.
SunTiger moved around the building a bunch.
Oh. mIRC up to 7.41 while I'm still on 7.36. Might fix something if I update.
Question is of course if I can find a crack for it or not p.
It works so why bother changing it.
'it works' 'I need to find a crack'.
I should say it sounds my basic needs then p.
Hey I can't stay on the good side of the law all the time.
Ministry Morbi is doing that thing again in alt text.
Yes. morbi likes to hint at future suffering for readers.
Eurgh why did I promise I would go buy groceries.
So I decide to finally sit down and watch Korra only to see that in the last week at most Netflix is no longer showing it |.
MairBear I'm pretty sure I still have the whole thing in my hd.
And am seeding a torrent of it.
Although the PC's of right now.
Yeah but it was so much more convenient and now is gone Dx.
That's going to be a noisy one isn't it?
At least it's not Bad Rats.
Bad Rats making money of of ironic steam gifts forever.
Octopuses often mistake each other's genders and accidentally have homosexual sex. They can copulate for days this way before realising. Must be the strangest realization to have.
2 poke balls left and I catch the last of the three regis D.
Dunno why I'm stubbornly catching all legendaries in the base ball when the others would be much faster >.>'.
MairBear uniform ball icons.
I guess also I don't like Ultra balls appearance.
They can copulate for days this way before realising <- no I think they realize within 5 minutes octopi just dont care.
Must. Resist. Using Hans Gruber for bad guy name in a story.
Btw if you like rpg speedruns ugh.
They are doing diablo 3 in 90 minutes though.
Going to watch that.
Hooray I found a song I can play AND sing along to that I don't hate at last.
One of my friends mentioned that back in the day he could play this song guitar after a lot of practice.
Think I'm a few eyars off that.
Cant remember if he mentioned how much time he spent practicing those riffs. But nowadays he just draws stuff instead.
Apparently it got all the ladies p.
Well this episode was surprisingly lewd in etotama.
Noelor do you have a spare palkia I could borrow for giratina portal and a spare groudon for dex-completion?
Didn't think anyone was taking on etotama looked canny dreadful to me.
GlennCuttlefish morbi's gonna morb.
Noelor any response was eaten by disconnect in which case apologies.
Did you get as far as catching groudon and/or palkia and may I borrow for dex/catching a giratina? o.
Think I... wait no.
You did have OR right?
Which means you have neither. Unless transferred from previous gen nevermind! x3.
Yeah I might have some in Bank.
But it's not installed atm.
Bank ate some of my common-mons C.
I think it was just common things. But I did have all eeveelutions in there which have been deleted.
Still got the special event mons from B/W and on so it's not a big deal.
Holy dang a FF7 update.
The first thing you find in the final dungeon is the Save Crystal sic. It's an item that allows you to drop a Save Point permanently at a destination of your choice within the crater. While a fairly unique item it's also possible to drop it in ways that will block your progress permanently locking you inside the final dungeon forever.
Sure is final dungeon.
And then the guy wonders why we accuse him of having bullshit luck skills.
Is... is that demon supposed to just be following half a meter behind him?
Yes. its a familiar.
It was spikes the whole time.
Tonberry is cool because he has an attack called Time Damage which damages you for the amount of time played in the current game. ...huh.
Its an attack useless against speedrunners.
But gold against completionists.
Here's a very secretive Materia hidden in the background to the left of Cloud.
See the floating materia in the platform? When you jump Cloud immediately jumps to the next platform automatically so you have a tiny time window to press the button and get it. It's super annoying.
Well yeah it's the last dungeon.
Gotta backtrack out of it to get anything done.
The weather is working again.
I already know the weather. Its raining.
For once my luck ran out.
Anathema you should ask Davey Camo on Twitter why he thinks Belgians are more human than the British.
Oh sweet my order of Sunstone vol 2 has already been shipped. Probably wont arrive until next week anyway since its a holiday tomorrow and free shipping meant longer shipping times. Oh well.
MoonWolf I had a discussion with Dob on Twitter.
MairBear new FE apparantly removing weapon durability. opinions ?
It seems to be a very controversial move.
One less thing to worry about that didn't make that big a difference to my playstyle. But I can see why it would.
Actually yeah it will make a difference.
Just walking around with the best weapon equipped on everyone is never something you can afford. Cos they break and then you're broke. But if that's no longer a thing....
Yeah but they can just make a game where you have to balance money for combat power that way.
And instead of weapons that have true upsides and downsides instead of clear upgrades for money.
That would be rad.
I historically always just used the cheapest weapon until something -had to die this turn- anyway though.
Well at least theres some progress with my wakfu. Unfortunately the delivery date is on friday.
Yes but friday. Something tells me I will not be at home.
So you'll get it saturday instaed.
Wont be home on saturday.
Nor most of sunday.
Oop no words tonight?
When did that happen?
No rpg cant play FF14 weather outside was miserable and I was dumber than baboon and walked more than necessary the package coming on friday this is a bad day |.
That happened around 12 my time.
I guess most of not in channel / paying attention.
I was just at work.
And also apparently have been disconnected most of the day.
Yeah sorry speedruns happened/are happening.
I mentioned it last night.
Must not have seen it.
So my PC was only switched on at like 10.
One step closer to velociraptors.
I heard games workshop are making a moba o_0.
I know they're doing a chess a moba wouldn't put it past them.
Seen so many I may well have seen something of that and it's glossed over.
GW Is heavily into games developed by small and cheap companies nowadays.
Well except with whatever deal they've got with Sega now but thats a leftover from THQ.
I remember really getting a hardon for dark millenium online.
It sure looks like HD ragnarok.
But where are the porings.
ChaosSmurf given the choice between that and another Iris storyline though or S1 Felicity even.
The worst level up.
That rumor has been going on for a while now. I know I linked an earlier article about it.
Is it bad if I buy just as an excuse to wear makeup and dress fancy?
In this unit you will look at the benefits and drawbacks of using low-cost or free translation tools for study and in everyday life hoo boy.
I am currently reading about Serial Point-to-Point Links over WAN and I want to scream. |.
I have no idea what that means but.
You think I have any fucking clue what even half this means? And then I have to test this in a couple of weeks to.
But of course I can't quit this thing because then my parents will get pissed at me since this all for getting a job or career or whatever.
Rather just write smut all day long or something. At least I find that fun to do than this. >_>.
Sorry. Just pissy that I have a test on the 6th next month which is a saturday and a national holiday which fucks up transportation something fierce.
I see Chip is putting good effort into scene transitions again.
Not very outrageous.
The dumbest way they could do Jem imaginable.
Where is the future where is the punk where are the misfits where is the outrage.
Remember where in Jem got famous by singing a song with an acoustic guitar ?
Where are the holograms.
The people ore the actual holograms.
Anyway biggest point is.
Its like the wrote a girl gets famous but rediscovers value of family thing like so much hollywood generic garbage.
And decided to bran it as that popular thing people liked at some point.
Oh hey a game that a friend of mine is developing is up on Steam for preorder.
What the hell is it with FF and loading pictures these days / Seems like half the time they refuse to load or just gets randomly corrupted even when I nuke the cache.
Been having the same problem. just get a black window.
Good to know its just me then. I just tend to get an outline whenever a 4chan image fails to load and some mention about it being corrupted.
*its just not me.
Why was there a loli in that closet?
Closet/locker/whatever. thing you store other things in.
As long as its not a yandere loli its all good.
The loli does throw a mean punch though.
It seems prefectly clear to me what its about.
!note Noelor I said something dumb to Lemon on irc and now this exists.
So what did you say?
Someone misworded the idea of just putting more C-Bombs in the past junctures.
And i commented that a bomb that explodes back through time was pretty impractical.
Which is ofcourse exactly what jammers are all about.
Why not make a bomb that explodes both backwards AND forwards at the same time?
Because they are in the future junction there are no stable junctures more future than they are.
I mean where is the dedication in getting the job done if you do not make a bomb that explodes so hard it explodes forward through time?
Look this is clearly because templars and or assassins.
So ww2 next probably.
The devs have said that the games won't go any further forward because guns ruin everything.
The games could do with having some actual innovation in them.
They've stuck to the same basic stuff over and over again for a long time.
Well yeah but thats unrelated ot the time and setting tbh.
Having guns in them might force them to actually think of something that isn't the same shit all over again.
This time it has a BOAT.
The things is that better guns just ruin the whole melee combat aspect.
The accurate the guns the less reason you have as a player to go into melee with someone and just start shooting from afar.
Duh make the assassin unable to use guns.
Which is just gonna look really dumb.
>objecting to putting dumb things in an assassin's creed game.
He was bitten by a gun as a child.
MairBear they are afraid of floating?
Even more so than what is already present tbh when previous games in the gunpowder age have firearms.
Hmm. 30% off coupon on GMG. Tempting to get something with that.
Jaina is a single female laywer fighting for her client wearing sexy miniskirts and being self-reliant.
Yeah i'm pretty sure jaina would not defend garrosh.
Since garrosh is the guy that made her all grim and dark and murder the horde.
Well it was either those lines or Having lots of sex p.
...she is pretty clearly the prosecuting lawyer.
That makes more sense.
Fuck whatever Cairn 2's called.
I only know this because of HS.
No Armstrong no.
So STO is a Good Game with Good programming.
And it defintily doesn't break if you try to run to many ships with the wrong kinds of abilities in the same zone.
Come back home attacked by a golden retriever. Well I say attacked but golden retrievers are really bad at that.
HELLO YES I AM THE BREAD QUEEN.
So it was mostly a lot of barking and rubbing against my leg while I scratched it.
Question for today is where the hell is my microphone.
Aaa I need to pick a meal to cook for tomorrow.
You mean puttanesca ?
The thing is once you've been told something is called slutty pasta.
It's difficult to remember another name for it.
>at work after 7.
I mean through the day.
I can leave at 4.
That still rules out slow cook... suggestions.
Also I am entertaining so slutty pasta is unsuitable.
How are you with pies?
How is pasta unsuitable for entertaining?
Anchovies garlic and olives in one dish?
How does a slutty pasta differ from a chaste pasta.
I have never cooked a pie in my life.
GlennCuttlefish its got capers in it.
I'm thinking maybe lemon chicken with something.
Wait..you put vegetables that is not tomato into your pasta?
Wait I forgot onions and garlic.
And i think capers are technically a fruit.
Mushrooms so totes go in plenty of pastas.
Have you never had a flipping carbonara?
I've had regular carbonara.
Not sure flipping carbonara is.
Mushrooms are not vegetables mind you.
This website is written by smart people Pork on itâ€™s own would never be fatty enough to be near ideal Keto macros itâ€™s also very clearly not a vegetable.
Pork not a vegetable.
Jesus christ that plot twist in punchline. Somehow this is now my AotS.
DoA 3 had a pretty good soundtrack from what I remember.
Only got like 2 or 3 tracks for it that I really liked.
Something like that. power shovel and something.
Oh yeah that was the movie that convinced me to get a proper dolby headphone card.
Instead of virtual surround.
Power Shovel It's to SHow True Bueaty Mayflower Caribbean Blue and Hunting Time in my case as my favourite DOA3 tracks.
Power shovel has no business being so good.
Why is 180 degrees akimbo so cool.
So I've come to the conclusion that Finns are basically the Scots of Scandanavia and Scots are basically the Finns of Great Britain.
Ah thats a classic.
Oh gods I always forget that kaskelotti in the middle of the gibberish.
And it always gets me.
Kaskelotti = sperm whale.
I still don't believe is real.
I dont agree with every noni but its pretty accurate.
I refuse to believe.
Robert Gustafsson is the Swedish equivalent to Robin Williams with being really spontanious.
Music for this scene.
Now this is truly outrageous.
Yeah but compared to the movie its great.
Same artist as Glory.
Oh I remember that track. But mostly the first part of the lyrics.
Not that it's installed apparently.
MoonWolf I hate russian dolls. They're so full of themselves.
So much of Feng Shui didn't go how I planned V.
Good thing I prepared it as a situation instead of a plotroad!
What did you actually expect then.
Oh come on internet that's just silly.
So what did you expect?
Ok so you know that one info local roll you made?
I vaguely remember something like that.
That you got a bit under 40 on in a system where the average result is in the low teens?
The information garnered there was originally going to show up over time and require you to chase the ninjas to get some of it.
Relatedly you would have been the pursuers in that car chase and it would have been before the ghost encounter instead of after.
I need more IED's.
At some point btw I think I still want to run the same scenario in Mage.
Maybe call it the gritty reboot =P.
Well Ã­ can't make Mr Lee in mage.
Thought you didn't want to play Mage though?
Actually Lee is probs a technocrat.
But anyway if you don't play you don't have to make your character.
Old notes are old.
AccountingNightmare has posted in the Sandcastle. O.
She was the poster who did the DMC4 LP a couple of years ago.
She never finished it.
I'm still angry about that.
Well yeah this does imply that she's gonna finish it.
If I had a better connection I could stream DMC4.
Ive got the connection but sadly not the skills to even play that game P.
Ministry So much of Feng Shui didn't go how I planned V - It's okay neither did Shadowrun as per usual.
What a cash-in.
A great improvement to an old classic.
Wonder if there was some mix up with my wakfu set or if I had just forgotten this weird cardgame thing was included.
Enjoy your wakfu cardgame anyway.
!note MairBear someone actualy used Twisting Nether against me in HS.
It wipes the whole board.
Just everything goes away.
Anathema FW is making their paint range btw.
Forgeowrld pain its like games workshop paint but MORE EXPENSIVE STILL.
With a different set of referential names.
Apparently their painting process involves a lot of mixing of other paints and including other paint brands.
Apparently painting this one involves a bunch of tamiya paints and other stuff.
Also applying paint that makes arms go seethrough.
Thats an advanced painting skill.
The arms can be swapped sooooo.
Noelor that image is the essence of lifehacks.
Valkyria Chronicles £5.09 on Steam.
I should finish that.
But WoD happened when i started it.
Still want to use that 30% off code I got from GMG on something.
Still havent played 2.
Besides there was a warning a while ago that the GMG W3 codes werent 100% legit as they had not been purchased from CDPR.
Cooked_Auto I'm seeing on facebook that some are calling Mad Max Fury Road feminist propaganda.
As the only person I know who's seen it any thoughts?
Which is pretty much bullshit.
The only thing about fury road i know is that it has a guy who plays a guitar solo on a flamethrower guitar.
Charlize Theron's character is the real MC of the story and there are a bunch of girls in it that do not talk about a guy or anything so this oooooobviously means its feminist propaganda to some.
Passes the Bechdel test = feminist propaganda.
Oh yeah it features women being badass therefore its bad or something.
Its a great action movie with good pacing and a lot of practical effects which is a rare sight these days.
How was its cinematography was it close-up quick-cut mess or did you get wide shots to actually show off the vehicle sequences.
Trailer wasn't convincing me.
The movie is post-apocalyptic car porn pretty much.
There is a whole bunch of good panoramic shots over the chase and fight sequences.
Can't really recall there being a lot of quick cuts and such like say in AoU.
With the vehicle sequences being in the forefront a lot of attention is put into them tbh.
There is also a good fist fight scene that's looks amazingly frantic without a lot of quick-cuts.
The movie also puts a surprising amount of detail into guns as well at parts and highlights something you rarely notice but I won't mention what exactly.
Is it trigger discipline?
Because I know that's your pet quibble.
Nope. Even if good trigger discipline is present.
I blame you entirely for my own noticing poor TD in... basically everything.
At least it's not Wilhelm.
You're in luck not present in this one as far as I could hear.
No I mean I don't recognise Wilhelm.
And am thankful for that.
You probably should be.
!note MairBear Khajit has wears if you have coin.
This is on Steam.
Guess they wanted some money.
Playing assassins at my old uni taught me a bit of TD but I don't think I obsess over looking for it.
After a while you just notice it.
That's the thing right.
I don't look for it.
Yeah I just see it anyway.
After having pointed it out so many times it just becomes a thing you see whenever its wrong.
Oh here's the buxx.
Anathema.
That is a lot of tiny and a few huge plastic soldier mans.
Anathema.
Made a spreadsheet about WoW token prices.
Holy fuck asia prices.
Difference in realm economics macroeconomics of the region the disparity of a currency value from 'real' terms.
I think my math on the percentages is wrong.
But I can't work out why.
Because I'm really stupid.
ChaosSmurf what were you even trying to do with the percentages.
Noelor I'm not sure.
I got tangled up in myself.
So today in front of me there was a seriously adorable little kid in miku cosplay.
And behind me there was a couple doing shibari.
Ropecon is a hell of a drug.
Also while having a beer people were singing the ducktales theme.
Oh and I played some dragonfire.
That game has some serious balance issues.
Ended up with all but one player dying and the final player soloing the dungeon.
Lots of questions over here Glenn.
Why were they doing this.
No sense of right or wrong.
Well they both had all of their clothes on.
Which reminds me there were at least 2 latex superheroes there.
One black cat and one spiderman. Sadly I saw the spiderman a lot more often.
Full disclosure! No update. Getting drunk and seeing Mad Max again. Have a problem? Fuck you. Oh TDI.

I'm home. Its over for me.
Mr Rope's wild ride never ends.
Well its next year.
Also in a less optimal place unfortunately.
Cooked_Auto you should note that to Dob >.>.
He likes robot lego.
Because he's into Pacific Rim and Lego?
!note BwaS.
So sadly I couldn't find any...gnomes/elves whatever the proper word was.
So I ended up buying a ghibli grandmother to fill this years slot in the shelf.
Also got a glow in the dark kodama piggy bank.
Meanwhile in ropecon.
Horse is kill indeed.
Well I just hit credits in ff14.
No idea if this is opening or ending credits.
MairBear I got my magitek armor. I am never dismounting again.
I think thats probably ending credits.
So ropecon has been held at Dipoli for the last 17 years or so.
But its going under renovations this year. There's now an invite in my facebook to an event that is happening around the time ropecon is usually held called door scratching at dipoli.
MairBear I got my magitek armor. I am never dismounting again < Dc.
Loli miku from ropecon. The costume looked better from another angle.
Therefor its not good.
Deliberately misspell a password. For example Smith can be spelled as Smyth or can also include numbers such as 5mYth. Another example could be Security spelled as 5ecur1ty. What the christ Cisco that doesnt really work anymore.
Yeah but this book was written back when kaazaa was still a thing.
Aw yis D.
Forgeworld convention exclusive shirt in this case.
Man Cooked_Auto the thief 4 ending is SO FUCKING DUMB.
You have no clue how dumb it will be.
If a lady says she's slipping you give her the claw thi4f moral.
Not bad using Zinge wheel I see.
Anathema +.
They also got a pretty neat looking conversion kit for the Taurox.
May try that on my next taurox.
Its either that or the Victoria Lamb kit.
But the Zinge kit is the most affordable one though since VM ships from Australia if I remember right.
If thats not a hoax i love it.
!note MairBear the French Facebook page for Hearthstone got updated with a new image cover a few hours ago. may or may not mean anything at all.
MoonWolf What the fuck. What the fuck.
Pretty sure the reverse of hooters would be a bar women go to in which they would be ogled.
MoonWolf What the fuuuuuuuuck.
Which is just amazingly lazy.
Welp turns out the girl I've been seeing is 10 years old than me and is uncomfortable with the age difference.
What a bummer chummer.
In the grim dark future of Sidonia there are still robot model kits.
Well nerds will be nerds and want to spend money on stuff.
The person in charge of the giant robot combat squads is in fact a massive nerd for building tiny giant robots.
Not the first time that's happened.
What exactly was baffling you C_A.
Well you did repeat the phrase what the fuck multiple times.
Oh the ending to Thi4f if you were wonder why went wtf.
So I assume something confounded you.
ALso to the point of reverse I guess it is in that its a place where women go to oggle at men.
That's not the reverse!
For the equivalent of $27 you can also order the â€œWall of Meat.â€.
I mean I know that's what that place *is*.
But that's not the reverse of Hooters x.
But maybe it is.
Have you considered that?
And decided it was wrong.
MoonWolf one of the people in Exalted pasted within a minute of you linking that.
And I got confused and a bit freaked out.
Wait feng shui seriously doesn't have any sentai archetype in it?
You could probably use the werewolf thing?
ChaosSmurf this is also objectively worse than the album version I don't like bad rap.
MoonWolf your country really just declared war on nature huh?
!note Noelor Fuck Nature.
Cooked_Auto will check it out tonight cannae podcast and work at the same time.
Even worse than bad.
I think rei should be mako instead of ryuuko. Mari should be ryuuko instead.
!note Noelor every song has bad rap now tho.
ChaosSmurf there is nothing about playing brightwing that isn't amazing.

BAKERY LOSES GAY CAKE BATTLE.

I'll find a link to... probably a beeb article.
Important to note the region in that story I feel.
Damages of Â£500 were agreed in advance by legal teams on both sides of the dispute. <- this sure is worth the international reporting.
Gotta get them clicks.
Lets see if I fixed my infinite loop.
My most listened to Sigur Ros song The Rains of Castamere p.
I think devs have a right not to be treated like shit too! Ghostcrawler with the revolutionary opinions in here.
I'm sorry but i have a deeply held genuine religious belief that devs are subhuman trash that keep nerfing my favourite class.
All devs hate their players. Its a fact.
Wish he was still working on a good game.
Anyway MoonWolf you know as well as I do that the coverage of that case was nothing to do with the individual case.
Hard to have a discussion when the other party keeps going away.
Now it never loops!
It isn't supposed to loop so yes that is what it now does!
Aw yis Sunstone vol 2 arrived today. And now Im gonna be responsible and read this text about ip subnetting before reading that.
Took thursday and friday off. 5 day weekend fuck yer.
Cooked_Auto enjoy your bitmasks.
I know I still wont be able to grasp jack shit for the practical test on thursday so I dont know why I really bother >_>.
Like I havent heard that a billion fucking times already.
And it STILL doesnt fucking help because as soon as I reach the subnetting part of a test my brain locks up.
Hm. Wonder if I need to get MS Word or can still use gdocs for making an ebook.
Oh wait it does do docx so yes. Good.
Oh wait it's actually not changing.
I imagine Mair will scream the same thing later P.
Dirty corrupt journalists etc.
Kirisu its changing a little bit.
Also no more breaking!
They aren't changing the weapon triangle.
They're folding more things into it.
So its changing a little bit.
They change the magic triangle every game.
That's the scale this is on.
Changing the triangle would be like swords no longer beat axes.
Or either of the other pairings.
What if they turned it into a square.
That would be a change yeah!
Like if they shoved knives between lances and swords.
Because those are a thing now.
I get it they're knives.
Wasn't sure if it went through >.>.
MoonWolf In the TOR companion comic the Empire totally built the Yamato.Â It exploded.
Well what did they expect.
Mage the Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition KS backers keep an eye out for your M20 PDF coming your way this week!
Exalted still not out.
1/3rd of the chapters now have page backgrounds or something.
So is it going to come out in 2015 at all or....
Wait why does that convern me we aren't playing it are we?
Just thought you'd be interested in the game existing.
Also seriously if the wait for E3 goes long enough I am actually going to gather a mostly-different group of players and run the gritty reboot of Shades Over Hiroshima in M20.
Boss fight in skyrim enjoyable get him down to his last legs and then he one shots me by accidentally throwing a physics object at me with his missed fireball.
MairBear that sure is skyrim.
Miraak is actually a decent battle though.
I thought it was overly gimmicky.
And I love/hate Neloth.
Thats the natural reaction.
Now you'll know exactly what your supposed to think about neloth in TGAO.
Anyone any clue what this is from?
Doesnt look like anything specfici.
Nah translating the tags doesnt say anything specific.
Meanwhile in case anyone was thinking y'know Fate just doesn't have enough meganekko.
Hey guess what book that I am on p679 of just showed up in Dropbox.
And which starting from tomorrow I'm not going to let myself read until next Friday.
Â€¢ With the Winter Soldier hot on their tail the Runaways flee to the Wild West of the 1872 domain!
Â€¢ Plus Jubilee is in for the shock of her life!
Â€¢ And Molly gets a cowboy hat! You guys are we still saying â€œadorbsâ€?
Did I miss Runaways actually starting?
I am totes still saying adorbs.
So far 141 people have signed up for the door scratching event on facebook.
Oh balls it's gone midnight and I still have my contacts in.
My eyes are going to be so dry '_'.
Dry eyed Noelor they'll call you.

All done on Solstheim c.
Thanks for saving the world from a horrible tentacle monster dragonborn by becoming the new horrible tentacle monster dragonborn.
Yeah but the last tentacle monster dragonborn was gonna turn on the tentacle monster.
I'm possibly worse therefore.
Well fuck. ran into a FATE in FF14 finished it and went to pick up a quest from town.
Quest tells me to do that FATE.
So now I have about 40-60 minutes of waiting ahead of me.
Go get some snaaaaaacks perhaps a car-bon-na-ted so-da.
I have successfully installed the drawing-based Chinese keyboard.
Man I am running out of alcohol.
But I still dont want to go outside.
That show was pretty good.
Must be a feminist catgirl.

Has science gone TOO FAR ?
One of my colleagues announced today that he and his gf will be having a baby this year.
Which is all well and nice.
He later apologised to me for the fact that he is probably going to raise it cisgender.
So i'm looking for images to turn into tokens for tonights game.
And find this NSFW.
Why would he ever apologize for that.
I dunno could be he's aware that raising spawn non-cisgender is a thing but in a quandary over it or has been overruled.
And then New York City is actually just the real Metropolis because all the cities are real cities in real life so Metropolis is just a fictional version of New York City in the same way Lana Lang is a fictional version of Gillian Zinser and Lex Luthor is a fictional version of Rupert Murdoch.
This thing is a goldmine.
GlennCuttlefish hence the bemusement.
1647 has science gone TOO FAR ? <- without clicking I'm going to say yes.
GlennCuttlefish that one panel in today's Poppy though.
Wait its updating 3 times a week again?
Well it updated today.
Don't think it did on Monday?
Gotta pick up food but will almost certainly be back in time.
But I agree with poppy. Dragons are in fact that.
In fact what ?
Thats a very hurtfull thing to say.
Recorded things someones partner said in their sleep.
Look for Boat on the tokens in 13th age get millenium falcon as a result.
Sorry I had to pop to shops.
Sound! Euphonium becoming Whiplash The Anime even more so now but with less throwing of chairs.
Sword and arrows.
MoonWolf TIL this exists in heraldry.
And it's the best fact about heraldry ever.
Due to reasons I don't fully understand to do with royalty this person exists and her name is... what it is.
Anathema we're blaming you for MoonWolf's balancing woes.
MoonWolf no idea what I just faced.
Hearthstone vs a warlock that I can only assume was trying to get the cheap-minion daily on ladder. But second turn echoing ooze. 3rd turn leper gnome and ooze. He did play a sea giant early on... but other than that it was useless 1-or-2 drops.
And No up front damage so I just priested.
Because thats a word now.
Everything he put down just was efficient trading.
I have a druid deck thats 90% 2 minions for 1 card.
Disconnect may have eaten my questions but Does it work well or is it just for quests.
<- troll parents.
!note MairBear its just for quests.
<- bag mouse.
Chinese have it all wrong ocean elephants are a type of seal not walrus |.
Actually no I think I got that wrong seals would be..sea elephants.
I dont think us Finns are particularly good at naming seals we call various types sea lions sea elephants sea tigers.
Yeah cant really come up with any good swedish examples.
The one exception is the ringed seal which lives in our waters.
GlennCuttlefish this is basically the dutch naming scheme too.
Man flat screen TV's are getting ridiculous.

Speaking of Asgardians from today's Loki Agent of Asgard #13. Quick setup Everything is dying and as the last incursion is happening Loki killed Balder and Jormungandr the World Serpent was awakened turning this into one last proper Ragnarok. Luckily for everyone starting with Odin.
Freyja's got the hookup.
I like odin with a minigun.
Its a good idea.
Odin with a turret.
Man I really should get MS Word installed because gdocs is terrible at fixing grammar.

Haha the same VA who did the japanese voice for Elizabeth in Persona 3 also the voice for Elizabeth in the japanese Bioshock Infinite dub v.
No fucks given.
No fucks given <- original hero do not steal.
So to ease my lonelyness I bought a rooster and painted him green.
This guy just fixed a broken vase by hitting it with a hammer.
Thats real craftsmanship right there.
The editor of PC Games N messaged me and said if I put my current twitter rant in an article they'd publish it.
I knew getting angry on the internet would pay off one day!
Well now I have to go see what it is.
It is a tired and broken record.
Angry over bad sc2 game design.
Over how it got split into 3 games?
I'll cut off your face.
Into three parts yeah?
What did you rant about then.
Still need to finish Dragonfall but they chuck one helluva fight at you with no breaks and I wish I had my entire team with me to deal with it /.
Err. the one in the ai lab or the one after it?
Castle/Mansion Courtyard. Its a bit too much after each other and one part gives you some really bad starting positions.
Oh yeah no FS tonight. Should probably take a nap just so I dont crash during the SR game.
GlennCuttlefish Blizzard balance philosophy in SC2.
His problem is that it's too balanced.
And they're expanding is and leaving its balance alone.
So it'll still be boring.
As opposed to say D3.
Thats not really... his argument.
In which the expansion turned the game on its head.
As opposed to literally all their other games most annoyingly.
Though it worries me for HotS too.
JESUS CHRIST I WONDER IF ANYONE WILL PAY ME TO RANT ABOUT ACRONYMS.
HOW COULD THEY FUCK THAT UP SO BADLY.
Well I mean Hearths of the Stone I don't think got shuffled up that bad?
That wasn't deliberate but I did notice it before pressing enter and chose to leave it in.
Hearthst of the Stone in true blizzard fashion suprised blizzard by being a popular competitive game months after release.
Nah they mix it up with that.
They added loads of random shit that looked like it'd ruin the game.
Turns out that it actually kinda works even though it makes me mad as fuck sometimes.
Yeah i have a lot of things i'd improve about the game.
GvG added a lot.
Nax added a lot.
But i'm not afraid it'll grow stale and stay in a rut.
Blackrock not so much.
The dragon gimmick isn't strong enough.
Which sort of leaves the expansion floundering.
The 6 mana 5/5 is ludicrous.
Blackrock's actual mechanical thing is that it cares about specific cards in hand right?
And grim patron did some stupid things.
But Naxx was like you need all these cards in your deck immediately.
The dragon tribal gimmick is effects on having a dragon card in hand.
But all the dragon cards a very expensive aside from one and none of them really work.
But they lack tempo.
So dragons decks are slow lumbering things.
I'm surprised Hunted Dragon isn't better.
Or whatever it's called.
The one that gives your opponenet a one mana guy.
It's a 4 mana 5/6.
ChaosSmurf its good if you're ahead on board.
Hunted Dragon was a Magic card from a Hunted cycle with a similar effect.
But a dragon deck rarely is when you want to drop a hungry dragon.
Yeah but so's a 4 mana 2/2 no abilities if you're already ahead right.
Oh I just would have thought it'd see play in normal decks.
Like Face Hunter or something.
Well okay not face hunter because lol 4 mana in that deck no ty but you know.
It may make it into some decks later.
But as far as i can tell not really right now.
They seem pretty averse to buffing cards.
Which actually seems alright to me.
Yeah thats one of the things.
So long as they can keep up a regular release schedule.
There are some basic set cards that are now outrigh inferior to expansion cards.
And i wish they'd revisit those.
But I assume we won't hear any more Hearthstone stuff until ... Gamescom?
Especially the boring no ability straight up drops.
That you'd never use over anything with actual powers.
Are they not needed for Arena.
That's always Magic's excuse though obviously they have a lot less to worry about in this department in general.
Like a 5 mana 3/5 is completely unplayable in cosntructed.
And not even that good in draft but sometimes you need a 3/5.
I don't think they'll break arena by buffing a 7/7 for 7.
The high drop slots just won't see play if they don't do something the moment you play them.
I'm not spending 7 mana on no effect.
Anyway they're never going to actually do that.
There has been 1 actual buff to a card on record.
And that was just to make its stated card text match reality.
Bane of doom actually summon a random demon instead of only random demons from the vanilla table.
ChaosSmurf do you know the MTG arcticle about why they can't stop bad cards from existing ?
I wish bane of doom only summoned from the vanilla table jeez.
I think I've read it.
Certain people are great fans of bringing it up anytime discussion of certain underpowered comes along.
And i hate it.
Because most of the cards i hate are not bad becuase their effects didn't really work out or don't work in the current meta.
They are just bad drops compared to everything else at that mana cost.
Often becuase they don't Do Shit.
People need to not compare Magic and Hearthstone.
They're so far apart.
For so many reasons.
Magic in 1994 and Hearthstone have more in common than Magic and Hearthstone now.
Maybe there's an article in that.
I've always been warded away from everyone needs to stop thinking this way articles though.
They sound very boring to write shitty to read and nothing but bad comments.
Yeah i can imagine.
Plus how many sites are intersted in the intersection of hearthstone and MTG.
Yeah not a lot.
The fact fansites don't pay.
Is a major annoyance in my life.
Because the way I think about games is always from the perspective of someone barely scratching the surface or someone deeply invested.
And neither of those perspectives are very valuable to mainstream sites.
They want you embedded but not too deep to not be able to write to the uninitiated.
And the sites that care about in depth are barely making money and if they are they're not going to be paying for you anyway.
Or they're in far deeper than I ever will be.
Damn TL is sweet.
Become part of the TL staff spearhead LiquidMagic.
I'd want to but I probably don't know enough.
Magic fansites DO pay.
But I've never had an angle for a column.
And then I ran out of money.
Another other liquid variation i'm surpised don't exist yet LiquidPoker.
The hell is liquidcardgame.
TeamLiquid probably the most famous starcraft 2 site in the west.
Expanded into other games.
They have LiquidHearth LiquidDota.
This...Didnt answer my question.
Do they have LiquidLeague.
I think its LiquidLegends but whatever.
They're the only ones who did well.
So its just a site for various games?
Man I remember when there was more than one StarCraft fansite.
Before The Reddit Times.
GlennCuttlefish that competitive teams for those games.
But they are sort of the forums/general news and competition tracker.
I remember when there were fansites at all.
With their massive completly comprehensive wiki.
Their SC wikis are good.
Their DOTA one is pretty poor compared to the gamepedia one.
And their league one is real bad.
Never used the league one.
But it's usually the best places for tourney results.
Dota wiki seemed okay to me.
The gamepedia one is official I think.
Or at least it's existed since before I got a key.
I was just wrong.
I was gonna say I thought it did.
Cause a bunch of old BW western 'pros' are poker players.
Elky and all that.
God knows where there is such an overlap between esports players and poker.
ChaosSmurf not just BW.
It's huge in Magic too.
But I guess that's more obvious.
Well for a while there in the US if you were above average intelligence and had decent internet access.
If there is ever a house cup in any of the games i care about tournaments for.
And didn't get bored by playing the same game every 20 minutes.
You can bet there is some massive sidegame of poker going on.
You could make serious money off Poker.
I was listening to one of the magic guys talk about poker.
And how he would play 12 tables at once.
100 hands an hour per table.
And he's in the middle of the pack as far as number of tables at once goes.
Yeah amaz came home from the seatstory cup he got knocked out in quarters but made a few thousand euros off of the poker so he didn't care.
Vs. say 80 hands an hour in a casino.
Yeah but at that point you've just turned yourself into a poker bot.
It sounds like a great way to never want to play poker again.
But if it gives you a six figure salary.
Particualrly back when it just picked up.
So most people weren't doing it.
And you just got a massive advantage on the majority of the field.
Even if you weren't top 50 you were always top 100.
And that's real money at world series etc.
I kinda wanted to get into Poker.
Just when Cad was getting into it.
That's a game I would play.
So c_a your compatriots chose a good song this yr gg.
And they appear to be through to saturday along with norway iceland denmark finland didn't make it though.
I will say this for ff14 The soundtrack has no business being this good.
GlennCuttlefish what part in particular?
Mair quite a few parts. Leviathans first half and king mog most recently.
Also magitek armor but I am not sure that should count.
MoonWolf nah SC2 was at Blizzcon the same year.
It was in Korea I'm full of shit.
Okay that makes more sense than gamecom.
The trilogy was Blizzcon the same year.
I knew it was not blizzcon though.
I was at WWI 2k8 which is where they talked Diablo.
Blizzcon 2k8 was a quiet one I think.
Then Blizzcon 2k9 was the one I was at with Cata and stuff.
Saw some games journos whining about Overwatch today.
Whats the problem with it ?
According to them anyway.
I don't really know.
They were talking shit.
One of them called Mercy a Kritzkreig medic in a skin tight suit.
And that it was just TF2 but worse.
Sadly as I proved myself that is how it seems at first glance.
But this far after announcement and with the videos we've had there's nothing to really support that any more.
Like calling WoW an everquest clone in 2010.
Can't deny that many of the characters are basically tf2 characters with some weapon or other though.
And people are going to see that.
And judge on it.
Being an everquest clone in 2010? What a WoW rip off.
And a whole suite of abilities.
Overwatch looks pretty dope.
Mercy is the closest I think.
But Hanzo doesn't really have a parallel.
Torbjorn is a angineer. hanzo is sort of a bow sniper.
Pharah the melee guys the support guys.
He's not he just has a bow.
His range is way shorter he shoots faster he can climb up walls.
I hope it has good melee gameplay.
It looks like CoD-style melee.
Which I dunno if that's good or bad.
GlennCuttlefish they've not show a melee hero yet.
I liked that if you got close in TF2 they couldn't just hit a button and kill you.
It doesn't one-shot in OW but it is clearly bound to a button rather than a weapon switch.
Individual hits also seem lethal in overwach in general.
Though that could always be tuned and retuned 15 times before release.
Hanzo was super lethal.
Tracer seems to be when she shows up.
I think it'll be about team combos.
Stun/hold/stop/pull them with x hit them with y.
Take point during respawn.
Get the russian lady to black hole them.
Nuke the ball of people.
I liked that if you got close in TF2 they couldn't just hit a button and kill you <- wait who did this?
Whereas in OW there's clearly a melee button.
UNLESS you just change to a melee attack on left mouse when your target is close enough.
I cant decide if melee buttons are good or not.
We'll get a better idea of what the deal is when they should footage of the big guy with the hammer.
Wondering who'll be next.
I liked how The specialists handled it where melee was a weapon of its own.
But could also be used without switching away from your weapon.
I miss that game. Kicking your opponents weapon out of their hands grabbing it from the air and then shooting them with it is the best feeling I've had in a multiplayer game.
Jeez the token slut on my feed thinks half-yearly anniversaries are things that need documenting past 12 months.
1whenever you talk about it it sounds pretty great.
Watching a stream think my music is too loud. press my pause button. my music starts playing. turns out it was just a track o the tream i also have.
Its an ancient HL1 mod.
Didn't it get a newer version that never went anywhere.
Double action boogaloo is a decent sequel but its not the same.
I just played DAB today its alive.
The pace of video release has been really weird.
Beta isn't till fall.
Might be console announcement at E3 I suppose.
Though Blizzard E3 presence.
They did D3 last year.
Or year before? whichever.
I remember fucking shiting it because I didn't see it coming and then it was D3.
Might go all in on Playstation ofc.
Imagine a console release of WoW.
By the time they make that console friendly its a different game.
It just isn't built for it on any level.
You could jerry rig it.
Triggers alter effects of other 6 buttons.
Even after the spells reduction you still have like 3 hotbars of the things.
Gives you 18 that's probably enough.
Many aoes require manual aiming.
Sometimes combined with moving.
Do you really want to raid with gamepad players ?
You can do that on a console.
Nah they'd be on their own servers I think.
Console Hearthstone more likely I suppose.
Honestly suprised its not on console yet.
If it works with 1 finger you can make it work with a gamepad.
Yeah that and Overwatch Sony conference.
Oh man hearthstone with motion controlls.
It'll be SO DUMB.
Could be worse could be on the rift.
Pretty sure you can already do that.
It has no point.
But you can.
Its a 3d game.
Guy behind oculus is really hyped for a VR hearthstone.
Reminds me more of that manly pony video.
That manly pony video is pretty great...If you're into that sort of thing.
Dob while I remember what time you want me over tomorrow?
Broadcast starts at 8.
Depends if you want nomz or not beforehand.
7 for half past?
If you give me something to go for I can get the timing right.
I dunno how I'm getting there yet.
But yeah say half past and I may be there earlier if I'm uncharacteristically punctual.
I think the defining element of our mutual relationship is punctuality is a fleeting goal.
Then again I take Noelor for the one who is either punctual or is usually a bit earlier than expected P.
Well it's one of those 'punctual when it matters' but when it's the informal as it often is it's a looser arrangement.
Cooked_Auto don't get me wrong I think we've been bottom 5 every time too.
And our acts have been awful for all my living memory.
Yeah i'm not sure how you guys decide on acts.
But its not great.
Last year if it had counted for the actual popular people vote.
Last year we had an X-factor style competition.
Common linnets would have been second.
Noelor how was your country THAT WRONG.
It was awful so this time I think the BBC just picked for us instead?
See England should obviously just do it the way we do a series of grand contests done in several places in the country with viewer voting.
I mean it's worked really well for us so far.
Isn't that basically what X-factor is though.
Bear in mind I never watched any of it.
But the X-Factor is all covers.
And I think also the Eurovision thing might have been?
Here's the opening number of the first preliminaries we had for this year back in February just to show the venue.
Based on a bit of what I heard on the radio at Dob's last night.
Hosted by last years winner.
Our problem is we have no good songwriters.
Get sweden to write them.
I think all songs in our case are proffessionally written anyway v.
Or at least nobody ever writes a good song for our Eurovision acts.
They already write a lot of other ones.
The other thing of course.
Is that as a country we don't actually care enough about Eurovision.
Stop being such an American MoonWolf.
Which is hilarious because I had one American friend who actually wanted to watch it while we were gaming last night.
It seems pretty popular in Scandinavia.
Based on their success rate.
Well its either being the ESC country or everybodys punching bag when it comes to immigration or just really plain non-existent p.
Oh and Ikea and meatballs.
So I almost prefer the ESC thing.
The BBC ran a twitter ticker under the in-between segments.
And basically every tweet for Sweden and Italy were to the effect of sploosh.
Yeah that's a joke that zips right past me.
This only makes sense if you watch Archer.
They were very attractive men.
I guess that makes sense.
One of the comments for Sweden was from memory Mr Sweden please take off your shirt and rub butter all over your chest.
I mean I knew about the Archer reference and all that but stil.
On that note there was a lot of people stripping of dresses to have other dresses beneath them this year.
I think it's just a traditional thing that everyone does now.
Since we invented it in the 80s.
As Dob mentioned the biggest surprise in that regard was the one act who was wearing a dress tall enough to fit another person beneath her.
But then actually she just was wearing it for the whole song it was just a silly dress.
Oh I cut my arm while shaving yesterday that explains why it's been feeling irritated by the hem of this t-shirt.
Eh it cut my face while shaving regularly.
Although shaving every day just makes that easier.
More shaving == more risk.
Yeah it was my right arm and I'm right-handed so it's even less of a surprise.
Just not sure how I missed it for something like 12 hours.
Shallow cut usually only starts hurting once its getting agitated.
Except that seriously it's exactly where the hem of that t-shirt sits.
I have longer sleeves in the drawer.
Every year a grand pageant is held where each of the twenty-seven kingdoms send a single talented bard to represent them on the world stage. This contest while supposedly held in the spirit of unity solidarity and building bridges between the kingdoms is in actual fact highly corrupt fractious and riven with political intrigue and tactical voting.
The PCs are tasked by their government who are responsible for hosting the tournament this year to make sure that this year there is no foul play and the event is not marred by the usual politicking particularly of the smaller North-Eastern nations.
>Work in the phrase Dog shaped robot buddy into the story I'm writing. >No fucks given.
MoonWolf he's still going.
I'm willing to bet he's not playing right now.
Damn someone's fucking my internet.
For a charity gaming stream this stream certainly lacks actually playing games.
He did play some.
Whats he even doing.
He's just sitting there.
Not talking not typing.
Might be on ads.
Just... making throat noises.
Can't stream at mobile.
Somebody is doing dirty things to my internet.
Ah first couple of proper strawberries of the year.
Taught the old folks to play Catan today.
Dad got shat on by dice so is not a fan.
Read is salty as fries.
Feelings suck how do people even understand them.
That's basically the root of a majority of the problems in the human world.
Oh wow that WC3 LP resumed.
Clearly once the singularity happens all emotions and feelings will be unnecessary. Beep boop.
MoonWolf the Oblivion LP finally finished the main plot!
Took a long time.
Plot isnt that plotty.
Well it did the proper tES experience.
Ie constantly being distracted by guild quests.
I hear Amsterdam is a tourist trap and all the fun to be had is in Rotterdam.
Because Rotterdam is anywhere Liverpool or Rome?
Its one step below eating macarons.
Cooked_Auto you got imperial armour 2nd edition? this torrent is going at 1kb/s...
No idea but I got the Battlescribe file for it.
Lemme check my drives.
The faux historical photographs are hilarious.
Their photography has gotten a lot better as far as Ive heard.
Apparently the images for their HH and later IA books are really good compared the early stuff like in IA vol 1 and Vraks 1st ed.
Just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right.
Have you received a fist-bump from a stick figure yet then C_A?
MoonWolf Mu More Fishy 13th age.
WC3 LPer I swear I'm not killing all the sheep as some sort of running joke. I just apparently do it automatically and only ever notice when doing the commentary.
That fried rice was cooked on Monday in Chinese grammar is That is Monday cooking's fried rice.
And I can't quite wrap my head round it.
I can see why.
Noelor I think i'd prefer it is That is Monday's cooking fried rice.
But the çš„ which basically translates as 's goes after the verb.
That is very awkward for us westerners.
We should start a petition.
Dear China fix your shit. With regards the imperalistic west.
Watching a special remastered Alien 3 I found in my downloads server iirc someone claimed it is a way better cut than the theatreical release.
Lets hope they were right.
Oh man the guy who plays Roose Bolton is in this.
>it is pointed out that Friends never acknowledges 9/11 other than by changing the opening credits.
Well fuck you too final fantasy 14.
Figured I'd do my daily random dungeon before it resets. I queue up as DPS average wait time is 7 minutes according to this.
21 minutes later still no sign of a party.
Reasons i play healers in mmo's includes that.
I have a tank but I figured I cant tank fast enough to run the party through the dungeon in 25 minutes if we get one of those tougher dungeons.
<- good cosplay.
Split between actually watching the LP or skip it and just check the history corners instead mostly because Ive played this one fairly recently.
Going ot just watch it.
I only know the most marginal stuff about it.
Is that from the same person as the DX LP?
Meaning they've finished the aforementioned LP.
Also the thi4th game.
Also the same guy who did thi4f and The Dark Mod.
But this one is going to be High Effort.
Infinite's the flying Americana one yes?
Might pick it up at some point probs for the essays though.
If there is a fight in tonight's Exalted I think I'm going to be doing Chinese homework on other players' turns >.>.
Really wish I had a garage.
Noelor well it is exalted combat.
Noelor if any of them take as long as C_A you should be able to finish it all off quickly p.
Anathema Well screw you too p.
Okay that bioshock lp episode was pretty good.
I should probably go check out bobbins desu ex stuff.
ChaosSmurf it was a typo.
<- MMD continues to bring us masterpieces.
Fetal Position Is Okay.
Wtf is going on in this examn that people need to curl up into the fetal position.
We've been exposed to the Great Contagion.
And are now all rolling Sta + Resistance.
This is actually tense.
This is why in tech you always need to plan around critical personnel getting Bussed.
As in literally hit by a bus.
Because you just have to live with the chance that sometimes something happens that means there is no chance to do a handoff no way to recover knowledge or information.
Cooked_Auto best at sailing.
MoonWolf you will find most companies are fucked if one or two vital people get bussed.
Thats their bad planning.
So Scully just got strangled by a guy who oozed out of a voodoo inflicted wound on her hand o_0.
Such a good show.
Oh it was just a vision / nightmare.
/d/ made a tv show?
Lemme find the name of it.
Star vs the forces of evil.
Wherein the main character is named Star Butterfly.
And has an arm tentacle ?
No Star has maaaagiiiicaaaal pooooweeeeers.
An exclusive look at Metzen's day planner.
Well they are corrupted orcs arent they?
Well they're not green.
So are they ?
Legend of Galactic Heroes does. not. fuck. around.
Not even a little.
Doesn't even feature the boarding praties of axe murderers.
Seems pretty standard 90s anime.
Then again I think Angel Cop and Mad Dog was a bit more over the top.
Thats because while LOGH might be a little bloody or over the top.
Its coherent and make sense.
Angel cop was just wtf through and through.
Star vs the forces of evil when the west tries making a magical girl show.
Man before and after pictures are getting more and more insane.
Well apparently a friend of mine almost got robbed just now.
But when he handed his possessions over the robber took one look at his busted ass phone with pity in his yes gave it back and left.
Cooked_Auto is that Thorin Oakenshield cross-dressing as a student or just someone taking the piss?
No they're the same person.
I am unbelievably jealous.
I mean frankly the DB Kickstarter should force everyone to spend slightly more money for all the same backer tiers the Solar Kickstarter had. And the very highest-level Solar Kickstarter options shouldn't even be available. sounds right.
New xcom game ? NEW XCOM GAME. it better be.
I'll get my hopes up after the teasing has stopped.
Cooked_Auto that sure was some drakengard.
Mandarin has two u sounds.
When writing one is ü.
TIL when typing that one is v because there's no actual v consonant in Chinese.
Good to know I guess.
I still like that cross is literally ten character.
Because a cross-shape is how you write ten å.
Btw the remastered / recut Alien 3 was waaay better than the original it actually had a plot!
Gonna watch the remastered Alien Resurrection this week at some point too.
Hopefully someone does a better Prometheus cut too at some point.
Let's not get too hopeful here.
Prometheus has less problems than Alien3 had.
Maybe I was distracted by Micheal Fassbender though.
Also fuck this exam has a comparative statement in a format slightly different to what I know.
So I'm not sure if Zhang is three years older or younger than Wang >_<.
Noelor 50% as MairBear would say.
Those odds were in your favour.
It actually was going to allow me two attempts.
The trick was to not put in Wang's age as Zhang's ie know which name is çŽ‹ and å¼.
MairBear why the hell do Lictors now have an Instinctive Behaviour!?
Man my hexchat's unicode is still sorely lacking.
Anathema because they were scary.
So they needed to have a high chance to be useless to the tyranid player.
So like most nid units then? P.
I really want to do a kaiju 'nid list once I've finished painting my guard.
And today one of my friends is getting drunk because the game he's been working on for a while now is going to be released on Steam. toot.
Lictors do have ld10.
So they resist it a lot.
'nids get lotsa warp charges it seems.
And mawlocs seem pretty lulzy.
What makes me grind my teeth is what they did to Instinctive Behaviour for the Feed category.
5050 chance to attack YOURSELF.
If you fail your nids rip each other apart some of the time.
Oh yeah that is silly.
Should only happen if there are no enemies within 12 or something and force you to declare a charge if there are.
Nope to busy to charge eating my friends.
I assume they did it because people would deepstrike a tervigon/mawloc in 5th ed out of synapse hoping they would fail their IB.
Cos that caused them to charge and gain 1 attack or 1 str I forget which.
So it was logical to make it not a reward. But they coulda just axed the boost.
Yeah especially with Overwatch.
Not you know encourage the enemy to kill your big ones even more cos then the shitlings will kill themselves.
Tyranid Warriors seem kinda underwhelming.
They look more badass than they are yeah.
They're good but they are too vulnable to instant death from heavy guns.
Yeah should be a way to give them Eternal Warrior.
Plus every unit of warriors is one less unit of genestealers D.
Yeah but any unit of warriors or genestealers is less points for really big monsters MairBear.
Warriors are fairly large.
But you need to have -some- troops.
They are on 50mm bases right?
Or your big monsters just get fucked up Dx.
It works for Imperial Knights why not 'nids!?
I mean if you just make sure some of your big monsters are tervigons....
Just take 8 flyrants and play.
Also yeah IB results for feed 1-3 hit themselves 4-5 charge closest enemy 6 Charge closest enemy and gain Rage.
If you roll a 6 on any behaviour then you do actually get a buff which offsets the loss of direct control.
Real good unit there.
Only if they fail the test.
Which they probably will if not in synapse.
I should get around to actually reading up how to 'nid again.
Not even picked up a paintbrush since Feb'14.
However with no brother living in this house his old room is now a dedicated cards game and models room.
Tanith Lee died.
MoonWolf on stream just now priest casts divine spirit -before- velen's chosen...
It immediately got equality on it.
And divine not inner who knows if there was an inner lurking though.
He was losing lots of legend points so he swapped early.
Well this is tryhard week afterall.
I made a gimmick maximum cardsteal priest deck.
But everyone is trying way to hard for that to work right now.
I fought one of those in arena c.
It'd be easier if i could just fit in more thoughtsteals.
Instead of 18 other ways to steal or ocpy cards.
Chromaggus better be in there.
Also chromaggus does not double up your nefarion cards.
I only recently realised chromaggus was not start-of-turn draw only though c.
Its everything that says Draw.
The best tweet.
Chinese for museum bo abundant many wu things guan building place.
Bowuguan building with lots of stuff in it museum.
So whats supermarket then ?
Probs just shangdian shop though.
My chinese final assignment is submitted!
Which I'll probably find harder and more stressful and etc.
I have to write an essay about whether the internet is good or bad for diversity.
Part of said essay what the shit does diversity even mean here?
Anathema I found a game that uses Moxie as a core stat.
You didn't notice it before ?
You've missed like 4 updates.
I generally dont actually browse the subforum itself.
I just use bookmarks.
And last time I checked I didnt see it so.
Subforum browsing is for scrubs it's true.
I just have an rss feed fore new LP threads.
Well aint you fancy schmancy.
<- yes and now you can be fancy too.
Dont think I have any rss readers anyway so and really dont use rss feeds.
If you use firefox you can just show it in as a bookmark and it'll show the last 10 items in the feed as a folder.
Fairy Costume Adventures' approach to PC death is that it's common but Don’t worry! You’ll get better as soon as you get bored with not existing.
I'm already bored of not existing.
Also if you're playing irl it recommends tracking Magic points with actual small candies.
That you can eat when you spend them.
This is never a good idea.
Is it the best idea?
Look someone is going to eat candy they're not s upposed to or there is going to be an accounting problem and now you need to give them more candy again.
And also its candy.
If they eat their candy without getting any benefit.
Just use something that isn't sweet and possibly messy if it gets wet or warm ?
But nobody wants those.
I mean obviously the candy is wrapped in some sort of shiny wrapping.
To prevent it getting sticky.
Anyway getting bored of not existing officially takes either five minutes/posts or as long as it takes you to go to the bathroom get another drink etc.
That's right this game is specifically set up to measure time in posts made for pbp games.
Most games just don't really care about pbp.
Or even anything not actually at a table.
If your Magic Tokens happen to be.
Edible it’s also the GM’s job to remind everyone not to snack on them during the game. But it’s not.
Her fault if you forget!
Slowly and at a loss ?
I mean isn't any bitcoin mining a loss when you really get down to it?
Speed dating featuring Vergil and Neromom would be something I never knew I wanted in a stylish action game.
Noelor okay yeah but i mean the electricity costs would be 10 or 100 times higher than the actual mined value.
Could an IBM mainframe from the 1960s mine Bitcoin? The idea seemed crazy so I decided to find out. I implemented the Bitcoin hash algorithm in assembly code for the IBM 1401 and tested it on a working vintage mainframe. It turns out that this computer could mine but so slowly it would take more than the lifetime of the universe to successfully mine a block. While modern hardware can.
Compute billions of hashes per second the 1401 takes 80 seconds to compute a single hash.
To summarize to mine a block at current difficulty the IBM 1401 would take about 5x10^14 years about 40000 times the current age of the universe. The electricity would cost about 10^18 dollars. And you'd get 25 bitcoins worth about $6000.
My estimate was... off.
By a few orders of magnitude.
Fairies have an innate sense for how to cause the most chaos in any given situation and for most it's both an unconscious and intuitive thing. There's a little voice in the back of their heads whispering “Hey... you know what would be awesome?” And that voice is almost never wrong. Shenanigans are the in-game representation of this sense.
As you carry out shenanigans your score goes up.
The goal is therefore to perform as many shenanigans as possible each session.
Does dying make your score go down ?
It's a group score.
Co-op costume fairy adventures.
In which fairies wear costumes. and have adventures. and aren't very creative at naming things.
The costumes grant them powers and many of them are anachronistic.
Aw man I'm two weeks behind on Fate.
I want to go to bed.
But my bed is occupied.
Eeyup all in our plan to reconquer what was once ours.
With Norway we are slowly infiltrating their society as cheap labour.
As for danes... go figure. We dont like those guys anyway.
Hahaha the setup for this must've been amazing.
Cooked_Auto I mean I felt it pretty obvious that's Nina.
Also is this a game that in any even slight way exists?
According to the Drakengard 3 thread yes.
It looks like the main focus of the game isn't going to be the game itself of which they are very little details but a town-building element that basically another ios/android shovelware F2P game. It seems like building up the town is going to be mandatory to progress in the actual game.
I should play DQ.
Y'know after all the other RPGs I have in my queue.
!weather remember Newcastle Upon Tyne.
Pants for your drinks?
I have no idea.
MairBear so there is now going to be a HS tournament where the deck rules are If you can build it you can play it.
You can play any deck you can build in the time between matches.
I don't get it.
So the tournament is 16 people everyone plays eachother once.
And there is no decklists no fixed decks no nothing.
SUrely people will just memorise top decks and build them in seconds.
I just don't see why that's a big difference from the usual approach D.
MairBear you know how long war made Van Doorn a character with his own voicepack ?
So Firaxes used the voice actor behind Van Doorn for a lot of stuff and never released many of those lines for game development reasons.
And they gave those the long war devs.
So now Van Doorn has a ton of new lines in the 15e test releases.
I love how no one has apparently pointed out the hilarity and absurdity that it's the US of all countries who is the head of the FIFA corruption investigation.
Cooked_Auto its actually sort of logical.
I know. But its still amusing.
Since the US is the one western country big enough to do that where they don't have a ton of infuence.
Considering how little the US cares about that sport.
I mean it makes perfect sense if you look at it but that doesnt stop it from being hilarious at the same time.
Also i heard its actually because some US companies got pissed of by FIFA over qatar stuff.
So its really still stupidly corrupt.
But this time its companies angry they don't get to be in on it.
And just going well FUCK YOU TOO BUDDY.
Apparently FBI had a mole inside FIFA. Which is kinda funny too.
The raid was carried out by more than a dozen plainclothes Swiss federal officers while journalists from the New York Times looked on from the hotelâ€™s well-appointed lobby. Like the cherry on top of a delicious cake if anything.
Well ofcourse it full of journalists.
FIFA can't do anything without journalists on top of it.
Not sure what the NYT was doing there though.
Not exactly great followers of football.
Based on what I read from the source tweet they apparently tipped those journos off that something was going on.
I mean it does specify NYT and not just journalists in general.
And the worst corruption of all pretending to be a football association when in fact you only associate soccer!
If i was on FIFA's side in that court case i would never not call it football.
Amazon now do subscriptions.
They have probably done them for a while.
Subscriptions to what ?
So I can tell them to send my 8 replacement razor heads every month.
Seems like a lot of razor heads a month.
That lipstick looks really out of place.
Yeah that's the pack size.
I might see if I can fiddle it to 6 weekly.
Cooked_Auto which RL? ?
I have no idea lemme check the thread.
I mean it could be any of them.
It could be nethack!
...any modern day one anyway.
Nothing in the thread.
And nothing via an RevGIS.
In fact that points me towards BSOD.
I figured it was a post-apoc one.
Also this will be the first and last time in my life i google electro lotus nodachi.
Amazon subscriptions are not flexible down to the week only per month.
Will it though SunTiger.
Show me your rigid numeric tower.
Would it hurt to remember my login for a week.
A highly practical weapon.
SunTiger wouldn't want hackers getting into your elfgames.
Stealing all them waifus.
Noelor what are they going to do.
Move my pogs around ?
Replace them all with dongs?
Okay guys i know you all wanted to go to some dwarves to argue about dwarf science.
But instead were playing fateDongs.
Please come up with aspects for you dong.
Going full on Magical Realm now.
Nah totally hackers' fault.
Rogue I think you might be doing this gym clothing thing a bit wrong.
Gambit's powers include agility?
I thought it was just the explosion thing.
Yeah that's mid 90's issue or something.
Like back when Rogue has Ms/Cptn Marvel's powers permanently because comics.
Yup Gambit has enhanced agility.
Like back when Rogue has Ms/Cptn Marvel's powers permanently because comics <- best rogue.
Dunno kinda like this look.
Is the M for Mutant?
The M is for Mommy Issues.
But shouldn't that be MI?
Well it seems smokes are going to get more expensive here. Again.
Not sure how I feel about that. On one hand it was an expense I can barely afford already on the other hand if you are going to tax something that is one of the better places. Now I just hope our government can put the money to good use.
What the piss.
Wait someone held a TES LARP? Huh.
ChaosSmurf sure looks like high level rifts.
Hm. 15% off for it.
Eh waiting for a sale to get it.
<- this is hiliarious only to me but hilarious. trust me.
Red you do with it?
Its just deal with it.
Literally as much as possible translated.
A completly literal translation back would be save yourself with it.
I didn't realise your king was a renowned baller but ok.
More baller than most members of your royal house.
You know what his hobby is ?
M8 no-one competes with Prince Harry for being a baller.
I can't help but feel challenged by that.
Despite the fact that I agree our royals are kinda boring.
Harry except I suppose yeah.
5th in line I think?
Anathema Harry cheats he actually had wars to go to.
He also dressed up as a nazi once.
Yeah he helicoptered as a job.
During the time Alexander was in the navy not a whole lot happened to get delpoyed at navy wise.
Not for the hell of it.
He wanted to partipate in the elfstedentocht.
But thats a bit of a hassle since you know.
Dangerous ice skating thing.
Its a longest natural ice skating event.
The tour de france of ice skating.
Its a little rare that it happens since it requires there to be ice in all the waterways between all the 11 cities in my province.
Anyway he registered under a pseudonym and did it anyway.
That is pretty badass.
I know our Crown Prince did military service in the Navy but I don't think he actually deployed anywhere.
Random royalty facts apparantly when he married Maxima he abandoned his rights to the british crown ecuase she's a roman cathotic.
Luckily they got restored.
If like 150 people ever die.
You guys changed the law.
Well that's some bullshit I.
Hope his filthy catholic kids aren't in the succession.
So that being married to a roman catholic no longer excludes you from british royal succesion.
Unless you mean you're not sure why we changed it.
In which case I'd also like to know!
Anyway if like 200 people die in the next 20 years or so maybe he can rule both our countries.
I don't know why you changed it.
Think they changed the can't marry a papist at the same time as elder princess can succeed before a younger prince sibling.
Commonwealth heads of state gathering constitutional change hey these are a bit backward kinda thing.
I think the only major succession law that got changed here was so that first born daughters could rule. Which meant that now it's Victoria instead of Carl Phillip that's next in line.
Yeah when George was not yet officially George and potentially Georgina ok.
Cooked_Auto yeah that only it took us until 2013.
Anyway so long as we still can't have a papist on the throne.
I guess it's okay.
We did that in the 1980's v.
In 1980 the rule of succession was changed from agnatic primogeniture to absolute primogeniture. This change in effect created Victoria born 1977 heir apparent passing over her younger brother Prince Carl Philip born 1979.
You and your papist-ist ways.
Noelor is it really ?
I have no idea why I feel so strongly about it.
Everyone in britain is secretly a royalist. Except scots.
Also means now if George either doesn't sire an heir the Cambridges have a 3rd who's male then Princess Charlotte would succeed ahead of such a hypothetical sibling.
Noelor do you actually feel strongly? I thought you were just Noeloring.
Anathema I actually do.
Not totally sure why.
The C of E would be in an absolute tizz.
Maybe it's best we avoid such a cataclysm.
Yeah that's the reason.
The reigning monarch is the de facto head of the Church of England.
And if they were a Papist that means the Pope's our boss again.
And the Synod Generals are meddling enough as it is.
I'm not sure of anything regarding foxes.
Canis vulpus I think.
I'm browsing through amazon's selection of board games.
Because my brother wants to buy me a late birthday present so I said I'd populate my amazon wishlist.
Aparently this is a boardgame.
Well look at it this way board games you lose a few pieces before you know it.
Socks you lose one of the pair mysteriously every full moon.
I see a link.
Don't think I could lose one of those.
It'd be a lot harder than a random regular sock amongst dozens at least.
Noelor the sock stealing creatures that lurk in their odd treasure goblin like dimension don't discriminate.
It would take the sock-eating elephant monster far longer to eat it.
MairBear I'm going to claim nerdiness high ground for referencing Pratchett instead of Blizzard.
I'm willingly going to concede it.
Because that was well earned.
Westboro Baptist Church... protest Ireland using signs depicting the flag of Ivory Coast.
I don't get it.
Vs.
Just fucking rotate it guys.
Its not that hard.
Also the Irish held a referendum about gay marriage last week.
Which is to say that the voting public of the Republic of Ireland decreed that you can marry someone of the same gender and have the same rights as if you were of different genders.
In case that wasn't clear.
Can they get on rights for other queer people now.
Like say trans ANYTHING AT ALL.
It happened on the same day as Eurovision which is probably a good reason not to have heard about it on top of not following British news.
Counterpoint better than crawling backwards.
This FIFA story promises to be interesting.
The investigation into Blazerâ€™s tax affairs turned up some choice claims about his lifestyle - including the revelation that Concacaf paid $18000 a month for his Trump Towers apartment and another $6000 a month for a second Trump Towers flat used mainly by his cats.
How many fucking cats does that man have.
Maybe he supports ... hmm drawing a blank at notable football clubs with 'cat' in them.
Oh yeah this is going to happen now.
We get to see how much shit the world has on FIFA / FIFA has on the world.
And if this really goes all the way.
Its ging to be a fucking STORM.
That's a defunct F1 team.
When the U.S. lost the 2022 bid to Qatar Clinton was rumored to be so upset he shattered a mirror. v.
Well you probably got that by osmosis from my feed where I call previous owner Tony Fernandes' other franchise Queens Park Rangers FC Caterham Park Rangers.
This is why it's bad that you keep calling things other things' names.
It is among the reasons.
But in-jokes are the toppest of the bants.
I am so hungry.
This is what you get.
Man this is nowhere near as cool as the stage version.
Noelor they should just have used the stage recording.
I'm pretty sure i know why PatternSpider fucked up that way.
And i can't fix it.
Instead of having a Ã¶ character they had an o followed by a put a above the previous character code.
And then somewhere between that going through 2 differen libraries and PatternSpider that did not quite work out.
2 different libraries PatternSpider irc and hexchat.
Okay irc didn't fuck it up.
I bet you can norlilize it.
Unless thats a library i don't know about.
I'm going to assume you meant normalize.
What got noelor youtubing eurovision videos I thought that was my scene...
They're apropriating your scene BwaS.
Heroes of Our Time got stuck in my head.
Probably because you linked the SatW on Facebook.
You think you got problems.
I've got the entire album stuck in my head during exams.
You can buy the album on Amazon's digital store.
But only select songs individually.
From the reviews The songs a lot of which are ballads...
Anyway the best songs Sweden Australia aren't available as singles and I don't want the whole album so w/e.
I'm pretty sure I can find the swedish entry as a single easily for you if you want an MP3 >_>.
The Italian act made a song about love then when asked to pick movies to reference in their video picked Ghost Back to the Future and Spiderman.
What a bunch of dorks.
Makes sense to me for the first two.
...Back to the Future.
That great romance of our time?
I mean BttF had after all.
And I mean Ghost has.
Oh I wasn't debating Ghost.
Now Spiderman is a lot trickier I can admit.
That just makes the other two even dorkier by comparison is my thing =P.
Tracer vid Noelor.
Am resisting while I get this essay done.
I mean the song everybody associates with Spiderman is.
Aw man I'd forgotten that.
Though also didn't think it was Nickelback.
Just the lead singer.
And y'know some band.
On the other hand the third movie did have this track.
Evidently I haven't seen Ghost or a part of BTTF where Marty McFly fucks over some lass' amphora.
Ok it's from Ghost.
They make a pot together.
I thought he actually used NB in Hero they just don't call it that to save face.
I think it might have been -1 member from NB?
Idk just remember it being credited as Chad K rather than Nickelback at the time.
Okay erm yeah all over the place.
We got Nickelback Saliva Soundgarden THeory of a Deadman Pearl Jam Our Lady Peace.
Man Power of Love has shit all to do with the actual movie of BttF.
Noelor you said power of love but in confused it with concept of love.
And i was very confused for a moment.
SunTiger I don't understand.
>Hating on the Power of Love >|.
The joke was see.
But yes I'm going to listen to this instead of Unchained Melody now.
Power of love as in it's a curious thing - that one? - that attached to bttf is it?
It's the end credits.
Well that was to be expected.
And like nowhere else in the movie iirc.
Johnny B. Goode otoh.
Integral to the plot.
SunTiger the finish of the highlight real is equal parts hilarious to revulsion.
I thought these seemed pretty cool.
Except a that price though.
MairBear yeah that was a story alright.
B they can't control playback which is a huge disadvantage compared to bluetooth.
Noelor yeaaah not that that price.
Cooked_Auto that image is all sorts of inaccurate.
Zeus has nothing to do with centaurs and he was the bull.
And suddenly I get booted out of mumble /.
Oh well got back in without issue once I had timed out.
A desk that extends itself above your reach to force you to do exercise!
Also it's got Cortana/Siri built in!
I'm not buying an asshole desk.
Yeah Im gonna pass on that.
I couldn't even successfully rationalise the last desk I pondered.
And that was a regular ikea one.
Got an old corner desk that works just fine.
Commllnks are also available In non-standard form factors at a slight premium. The most popular non-standard form factors Include articles of clothing pens glasses pocket and wrist watches purses hats fedoras are In fashion for both genders canes knives and small pistols. Goddamn it SR5 >|.
BwaS you needed to rationalize a regular desk ?
He means replacing his current one with a new one p sure.
Oh its that late already.
I might be a bit late depending how this dungeon pans out.
SunTiger maybe its a fraction atm!
SunTiger>> yeah like I had a desk in my bedroom from ever since school started setting homework.
I HAVE MADE A PIZZA INCLUDING THE BASE.
Tossed it out on a whim two summers back indecisive about its replacement.
<- this is a URL designed to be misread.
This after I'd 'colonised' the downstairs study for doing uni base of operations.
Just had the feeling in my head of 'the one for hard sums' 'the one for vidja'.
And yeah never happened.
Wait wait wait.
2015 is *actually* the year of the hoverboard?
Has kickstarting science gone too far?
No that point has already been crossed. Multiple times.
A single slice of pizza was sent into space.
For a music video.
As some sort of pseudo stretchgoal.
Also wow is that the time.
Going to go check the food sitch.
I've heard about weirder things being sent into space. But I guess that sorta takes the cake when taken into that context.
Food sitch my dinner is being nuked from block-of-ice to edible-rice as I type.
That's quite the transmutation to go from ice to rice.
But all you need to do is add an r.
Will load up roll20 in just a few minutes.
Cooked_Auto that art D=.
Bah overwatch thread with no decent art and smut I havent already seen >_>.
My heart bleeds for you.
She-hulk shore v.
Pleiades is getting canny technical.
Characters travelling approaching c relativistic effects and red shift.
I thought it was about magical girls ?
But the theme is astronomy.
For... japan reasons I suppose.
Note astroNOMy not astroLOGy.
They're meteor showers or something not constellations.
Well the mechanic of arrival of the plot devices they're collecting is meteor showers.
Oh internet. Also I am going to hell.
Took me a while but yes definitely hellbound.
Not the bees!
!note MairBear Fix macros you butt.
Noelor>> that's why all the cool kids use gen y.
Jesus Christ Drax.
Source comic is.
Pretty much always yeah.
Ok so I'm researching GamerGate because I want to talk in my essay about how the internet's just giving us an excuse to be even more divided about dumb shit than ever.
In a Forbes article I read Wizardchan... a forum for male virgins and I'm all 'well that's a pretty inflammatory description for a web forum coming from Forbes'.
Then I realised why it was actually a completely legitimate description and hate myself for knowing why.
OpenOffice being free is nice and all but it does this weird predictive text thing when you type a long word often enough only it's picked up on a typo I kept making instead of an actual word so now it's auto-suggesting a non-word -.
Use gdocs instead imo.
Open office is semi-trash.
I used gdocs for my first couple assignments.
But they all need to be saved as .doc.
You can get gdocs to do that.
Well fuck I've just got to purple this up a bit now so w/e.
I'll try and figure that out for next year though.
Yeah you just go to the menu and ask it to download as a .doc docs pdf w/e.
Although docx rather than doc.
That's probably also fine though.
It used to be able to do doc.
I've only used it for PDFs for a while.
I knew it did uh.
Had somehow missed the download option was probably looking for save instead like a ninny.
...nincompoop's probably racist knowing English.
I think I looked it up once and it's pretty okay.
Wimp is sexist tho.
Or at least anti-effeminate.
Yes though only by social context rather than etymology.
Nah I think both.
I remember looking it up.
Cause I was looking for derogatory terms I could use on twitter/RPS without getting fired.
Maybe I'm full of shit.
Not that etymonline's infallible it's just basically the only dedicated thing for this.
Is that not enough to just ignore.
Anyway either way you'd be better off just writing a whole 'nother 100+ word paragraph and then cutting.
Yeah I probs should do that.
Chuck another the internet's a good thing point in there.
You'll be faster writing a paragraph then nuking than the other way.
Unless you've been keeping track of places to add detail throughout.
It's the referencing that gets me.
I've been scattering in hyperlinks but I need to have a proper bibliography at the end because uni and I'm referring to the textbook too.
I hope I don't ruin some marker's day by forcing them to read this whole article on Forbes.
But it was either that or reference wikipedia and... no.
I only really needed a couple of quotes is the annoyance of it.
An unironic use of the battle lines were drawn and each side labelled the other in order to dehumanise them.
...I have no idea if I sic a *ize in this.
Nah you don't need to sic americanisms unless academia is completely insane.
It's an OU base-level linguistics course.
A weird thing I'm doing in some of these references.
Is I'm quoting my textbook.
Which itself was actually quoting some other text.
So the reference is like Oxford University Press cited by the Open University 2014.
And then I give the OU page reference and if someone genuinely wants to check it they'll find the original citation's reference in that book although in this particular instance they're probably a member of the team who wrote that book so that's a whole other layer of weird.
ChaosSmurf going to go ahead and say Tracer is not a character for beginners.
Like you really have to know maps to zip about like this.
Omg her constant time puns =D.
Man Pharah really needs a defense boost or something on her flight mode.
Both essays submitted into the portal on time \o/.
And now my caffeine's starting to wear off~.
Sure was an all nighter.
If the deadline had been 5 or whatever rather than noon.
I'd have gone to bed and done it this morning.
But it was noon and I know what I sleep like so.
GlennCuddlefish full circle?
You should probably go do that th ing.
Ashley's evil face in today's EGS.
<- this is cool no clue how hofficial it is.
But imperial DB dynasty houses and symbols.
>Cynis is three interlocked nipple rings.
Noelor see this doesn't work because its not awful.
What isn't aweful ?
That sandra and woo comic thing linked.
..and hate myself for knowing why <- what why?
Mair Beagle I'm very good at edging.
My Macros -should- be working.
Though there is one skill I'm uncertain about how to macro.
Because it implies that I roll seperately for every target hit.
And it targets literally everything nearby allies included.
The thing about Beagle is he does to XCOM what Trump does but it's infinitely more watchable.
Also the average xcom turn is a lot more complex than the things trump ropes on.
Indeed but still relative to my own turns in both games.
I kind of want to see the latest mad max. Wonder how long until it comes out on bluray.
I have so many macros that I ran out of space on the bar in roll20.
Oh I can scroll it to the right. Still a pain in the ass any way I can have 2 lines of macros instead?
I'm sure SunTiger could whip up some CSS for that.
I think those macros are correct now.
So I was whistling while filling the kettle and suddenly a pigeon detatches from a nearby tree and flys face level into the window.
You might have some latent pigeon whistlerer talents mair.
I am sure it was a coincidence.
But I like to think I could recreate it.
You could team up with Squirrel Girl.
Squirrel girl and pigeon boy.
Eating 150g+ of protein a day is hard.
Yes it would be.
A large egg is only 7.5g.
Chicken breast is 16g of protein per 100g of mass |.
So effectively I need to eat a kilo of chicken a day.
Which is like a whole chicken then some more.
Oh man worse for endurance athletes.
500g of carbohydrates a day.
The weight you're able to lift at relative to your body weight will determine whether you are a beginner novice intermediate advanced or elite lifter.
Who's about out of the Feng Shui group?
This week I actually printed a shot counter.
So please pick a pawn colour from green orange white black purple pink blue yellow red.
Relatedly Exalted War for the Throne has the most egregious size of box vs volume of components discrepancies of any board game I own.
Then I realised why it was actually a completely legitimate description and hate myself for knowing why <- what why would you hate yourself for that.
Because it is such a truly awful internet-ism.
No! yelloooooow *gets launched into a firey pit*.
Noelor red i gues.
But in all seriousness I'll go with blue.
Alternativly go to your monopoly set and grab the racecar.
I have no idea where our Monopoly is.
Or what edition it would be.
Monopoly is a bad game and I cant understand why everybody has one.
GlennCuddlefish same but dnd 3.5.
I honestly feel like the pawns might be Monopoly's one good feature.
Anyway based on your combination of chosen colours you are being represented by meeples from Five Tribes.
Mooks are Earth and Water aspect legions from Exalted War for the Throne which is basically magical Risk on the Blessed Isle I think.
And the featured foes and boss will be... Necron soldiers.
A very intersting combination of tokens.
You're all gonna die.
If we do we'll die gloriously.
I doubt they'll really have gauss flayers =p.
Also its the last session regardless.
I somehow need to work in a Yippie Kay yay. Dunno how and when.
They don't have gauss flayers but they do have necrotic hell blasts.
If that makes a difference.
Yeah well GlennCuddlefish can spin and kick at the same time.
<- get fucked europe they're ours.
One of the necron warriors just rolled 9/9/9/10/9 for initiative.
Noelor patternspider does not log dicerolls.
Only chat lines that quality as good enough to learn for his chatbot bit.
Well yeah its been rumored for a month now or so.
Anyway yeah one of the necron warriors got really good initiative rolls.
So that demon's element is now lightning.
One of the necron warriors just rolled 9/9/9/10/9 for initiative <- did you forget how initiate rolls work again ?
1400 Noelor -- 2 -- 2+7.
1400 Noelor -- Result 9.
1400 Noelor -- Result 9.
1400 Noelor -- 2 -- 2+7.
I gave the necrons/demons some defensive schticks.
Partly because of last week partly because of what I'm using to represent them.
First came the oldcrons then the newcrons and now the decrons.
Cool effect of the Feng Shui character sheet layout having printed out your character sheets I can lay them out on my desk overlapping each other.
And be able to see all your important numbers without taking too much space.
Because they're all in the column on the right.
Probably not a feature of the design but a nice result anyway.
Probably is a feature!
All the sheets are in the book.
So... let me check if these are all on odd pages.
In the book layout it will be so that you can flip through the pages and find your character and stats without turning over pages fully.
Just a quick skim down the margin.
Game's ready to go.
Not in shot pre-rolled mook attack sheet.
Also all the enemy stats in my RPG notebook.
High level prep up in this channel.
Original Paper Mario is in the Nintendo eShop but not Thousand-Year Door.
Birdo's reason to come to Mimin Island is to become popular with all the boys but is arrested by Mappo after walking in the women's restroom uncertain of Birdo's sex. Birdo claims that Nick is her boyfriend after Nick proves she is female and releases her from prison this is a 2nd-party Nintendo game.
Surprisingly enough it hasn't been localised to America!
>streamer playing Paper Mario 2 gets Madame Flurry.
>commenter in chat says you could say this part of the game really blows.
Need to nip that sort of thing in the bud before it becomes a trend.
Otoh he's pronouncing Waluigi as Woh-luigi instead of Wah!-luigi.
So WildStar is going totally free to play o.
I'm all for that though do regret the one month I just put in xD.
It was your fault Mair your touch is death to MMOs.
Well that was a nice confidence boost. Watched a video of a drawing stream artist does a good job. Then he does the same thing with his left hand.
Glenn Oh yeah. An artist friend of mine had to stop drawing because of possible muscles issues in his main drawing hand and then he tried drawing with his off hand. With not so spectacular results.
Stop drawing for a while I should add.
Less < in the end.
We pretty much told him to take a break so he could check out why his hand hurt so much. Turns out it was a posture problem.
Don't worry I'm apparantly still classed as an 'untrained' weightlifter and I still suck at guitar playing p.
I should get some light weights as well.
Something with adjustable weights since I will never be able to use my left arm as well as my right arm.
Any good dumbbell set should have adjustable weights.
A bucket and a bag of sand is also an option p.
Well since my phone has loaded up again back to sitting on the veranda...or porch. not sure which. Possibly closer to porch.
And now Medibot is in the Paper Mario stream so everything is excellent.
I say stream youtube upload of last week's stream.
Thousand Year Door is definitely a game with a set pace to it... and it's not a fast one.
Treat your viewers like you wish the game would treat you that's the LP code of conduct.
Mair I cant take this quest chain. Just got to the costa de sol scene where the young couple are introduced for the first time.
I am not sure which quest.
Wait is that motherfucking ultros?
Also did I ever talk about our current government besides the minor griping about tobacco taxes?
I know you hate it.
I knew it was going to be bad but now that I have heard their plans its even worse.
Are they banning saunas ?
No. But they are cutting benefits from all the places benefits should not be cut.
Was benefit the right word for this I dont know.
Benefits are this'll be simplified things given to those who can't afford but need them.
Or the money to get those things.
So no but you get my point even so.
Anyhow education science and culture funding is getting cut by 556 million by the year 2020.
Social and health services by 451 million.
Social benefits by 860 million.
In fact just about the only things not getting cut are the police and the military.
Oh and our minister of finance is calling professors lazy because they according to him get 3 months off a year our attourney general is pro-death penalty and our minister of social affaird and health is according to her own words vaccine critical.
Our attourney general is pro-death penalty <- snap!
Its a good thing video games are such a good escapism mechanism.
We also have a pro-capital justice secretary.
Otherwise I might be angry about all this.
Ugh I made the mistake of eating a bunch of pizza then watching someone else play an FPS so now my stomach's woozy.
Going to step outside for a bit to get some fresh air might be back a few minutes after eight.
Or nine or ten timezones whatever.
Guess i'll watch some etotama meanwhile then.
Fetching water and then I'm ready.
Goddamnit it was that thing.
Skottie Young covers are the best thing.
Project Titan's 'mute team chat' makes for a very pleasant experience.
Turns the thing into single player with bots with actual rewards from gameplay.
I might get into this beta test yet.
How good are the bots ?
Wait wasn't project titan cancelled.
Or is this another titan.
He's just talking about overwatch.
Because BwaS can 't call things what they are really called.
No not that Project Titan the other Project Titan.
That Project Titan isn't even in beta yet.
Talking of hell.
The F2P restrictions for Wildstar are kinda terrible.
Gamergate came at me on twitter.
Also another one of those Overwatch vids came out.
ChaosSmurf what for ?
Who I both don't understand and looks dull as fuck.
I meant the GG rsh.
One of them went at a friend so then we subtweeted him for a bit and hours later all his mates showed up.
They seem to be done now.
Internal dialogue this combat.
Noelor already posted that...today?
That fucking daimyo.
Deleted AoU footage Quicksilver hitting on any attractive woman he sees throughout the movie. Hah.
QS complains of sore feet cos the adidas trainers he pulled out of Stark's locker weren't actually in his size.
Sadly not a thing.
!note MairBear When does your Japanese class continue 'til?
ChaosSmurf yeah Symmetra seemed not great.
Place turrets everywhere sometimes buff.
I wanna see what Dwarfname's turret is like.
Cause it should be about half as powerful as Engineer's.
Yeah Dwarfname that's what I said.
There might be an h or a nordic o in there something.
I'd be intrigued if that 'killdozer' ends up as a regular.
Just found it weird how they were like yeah we just pulled this out our arse have niche strats for it and fanon names for those niche strats.
...were you somehow unaware of the type of people who work at Blizzard?
ChaosSmurf all this year's seasons of the comics shows and Elementary have finished now right?
Which I haven't been watching.
In spite of your 5* review.
Unrelated you interested in playing Mage in the next month or so?
Short campaign gritty reboot of the Feng Shui one that wrapped up tonight Glenn's on board and will be the only other person to see both versions.
Watching the SHIELD finale.
Kal's final form's p good.
That was fast.
ChaosSmurf these fucking we got renewed finales.
It's better than the Angel season 5 way.
Did they blow up the world and then have to explain why it was less exploded than they thought?
The Arrow finale is every yes.
Nah Angel got cancelled.
So it ended with the entire main cast trapped in hell about to fight a horde of demons including a dragon.
After the best season they'd done by fucking miles.
Yeah it was pretty awful.
Angel was pretty bad tbh.
I don't really understand people that like the middle 3 seasons.
Fairly sure Buffy and Angel are basically trash.
So are Arrow and Flash.
But they don't have the problems of being made in the 90s.
And I don't think either has entirely bad seasons.
And season 3/4 of Angel is PRETTY HARD to defend.
Arrow 1's the worst.
As is Seasons 1 and 5 of buffy.
Oh I forgot how bad Arrow 1 was.
But all television into the bin.
Now you're the one who's going to go into a box... in the ground! yeah no this dialogue is not at all garbage.
I have long ago stopped trying to understand archie.
There is no understanding.
MairBear so there is another viagame house cup.
MairBear this time IN A CASTLE.
And there's a vampire on the casting table.
Archie comics has gone all in for weird crossovers and alternatives. Which is great.
MairBear rumours of a Genestealer Cult codex this summer O.
Followed by plastic Sisters of Battle? p.
And the glorious return of Squats.
Squats returning would be rather glorious I guess.
A most glorious return.
A very short return.
OH YOU MEAN STREAM.
Yeah viagame between match stuff is.
I don't even question it anymore.
I blame p utting the players in charge of stuff.
I mean I just..Its... I.
MairBear i blame kyary pamyu pamyu.
Even though this is korean.
I'm going to make tea in protest.
MairBear can't handle the stream.
MoonWolf is the latest like late April Long War usable?
The latest is actually like 5 days old.
And yeah it hsould be good.
Nothing horrible has been reported.
Now comes with some fancy new things.
Like the Command power for officers.
That gives troops a yellow move action after they have finished their turn.
Does Long War make XCOM actually fun?
Not if you don't like it to begin with.
MairBear did you see that clockwork giant fuck handlock/freezemage deck of thijsnl ?
Was why I like tourneys.
I love that deck.
Its completly pointless 90% of the time.
Except in those two situations.
Then its hilariosly good.
I might make it up as close as I can but I lack clockworks.
Just for if/when I'm frustrated by Handlock and Freezemage which isn't often.
I think i have 1 clockwork giant.
But no way am i crafting one.
I have better things to spend dust on.
Really need that card.
I think sylvannas and alexstraza are the two non warrior deck legendaries i still need from the core set.
I crafted Dr. Skill a week or so ago.
I finally have the dust for Dr. Skill.
I'm just waiting till i have a good deck for him.
Well I have secretsmage which I prefer.
Could swap something I'm sure.
Also Dr. Skill goes in every deck.
If I can play boom then my facehunter has already lost c.
I played against a hunter who had a actual copy of gaz'rilla in there.
Not a drop from the spider.
MairBear btw Advent advetisement website 95% confirmed for XCOM thing.
Waiting until its 99.999% confirmed instead. Besides it could just be something like The Bureau all over again.
Okay so there is a bunch of letters in black there.
And in the pdf link inside of there if you look at the red letter in the molecule.
You get the letters GFIIILOD and NCOVO.
Which is an anagram of Vigilo Confido.
And then it turns out its an XCom shooter v.
Cooked_Auto well that would be disapointing.
But it would be xcom i guess.
I'm hoping for remake.
Tftd was shit andyway.
So apocaylpse is the next logical stop over.
I'm sure it'd be fine but it's less... modern.
Okay so i hate tftd because its basically the first game but underwater and research everything all over again.
Plus i hate the movement in water thing.
And apoc or it doens't have to be quite apoc.
Just have tech level-ish of the base game as a starting point.
Is fun and logical.
Sfw splatton squid girl anime cute thing.
I linked that one earlier this week official collaboration even.
From what I recal it's an official collaboration piece between nintendo and the studio that has the ika musume rights.
Yay first longwar mission no deaths yet.
I'm not totally useless at games.
I'm currently trying to remember all the mission names i changed for longwar.
This time i'm keeping a backup.
I should do that.
XGMission <- header for the mission section.
Great now they are playing fucking rickroll music.
...goddamn it twitch chat.
MW mumble for the hell of it?
Edilith is defiling Sweden and Finland in about 3 weeks.
She said she has holiday booked last week of june and will be bringing her filth and a friend with her to stockholm mariehamn and helsinki/turku they haven't decided on which city in finland but she'd like to meet up with both of you if possible.
I can do Stockholm just fine even multiple days even if so wanted.
Just give me a date really and I can fix the rest.
Excellent I believe they're starting in stockholm as they land there and then moving right.
Mostly because I'll have to fly up or something as to not spend 8 to 10 hours by train.
Righty she told me today so they're full on planning at the moment.
Right now their plans are Stockholm>Ã…land>Finland>home.
And she has holiday booked from the week starting 22nd of June I'll let you know when they are getting there.
Did you know spiders born of love energy have remarkable flatulence? It's true! Also that said flatulence is composed of deadly neurotoxins? It's all accurate. Such is the dangerous nature of premarital relations kids Three story tall poisonous doom-spiders.
Looks like MoonWolf can't play Witcher 3.
I mean it has puns.
You can mod it out there's already nude geralts around.
Only $19.99 on steam.
There is also a Ciri nude mod >_>.
KaunMoth I can do helsinki or stockholm Ã¥bu is also an option but it might end up being as expensive as going to stockholm P.
So today I ended up at some goth rave thing. On a boat.
Social anxiety was acting up until I had 3 shots of vodka.
Hey we're getting visited by aliens and we don't know if they're hostile or friendly so we're just going to call them Ravagers.
Cooked_Auto well you know.
They're basically hoping to get invaded.
So their can break out the fancier guns.
GlennCuttlefish their plan is to go to stockholm then Ã¥land then finland either turku or helsinki but fly back to london from helsinki.
And edilith really wants to see you.
As I said stockholm or helsinki are the most optimal for me. Helsinki is the cheapest but I kind of want an excuse to visit stockholm as well.
Helsini vantaa airport is a relatively short bus trip from here.
Actually at that point its a relatively short train trip from here.
Yeah there's a local airport/AFB nearby that I can take a direct flight from to Stockholm.
Fair enough I'll let you both know when they give me their days.
Cooked_Auto I've told ed what you told me that you can do stockholm as long as you get days.
I mean I can just book a hotel/hostel room or something if needed so.
I'll get a ferry over and take it from there I can always bugger back home so from stockholm it's not really an issue for me.
Yeah I figure as much.
Though she wants to take the cruise over to Ã¥land instead of the regular ferry.
Yeah.. just book a cabin.
Oh hey somebody got a picture from the dance floor of yesterdays goth party.
GlennCuttlefish thats impressive dancing.
He's listening to a boombox and reading Shounen Jump! 80s problems in this show.
MairBear Operation She Blinded me with Soup.
MoonWolf I don't actually care for XCOM gameplay now I just want to win and base so I can see the next mission.
Cos Freudian Jugular feels like a waste C.
2 bleedouts but no casualties. Phew.
You walk a dangerous line MairBear.
In my defense I moved to a spot where I'd have a view of alien but he was not there.
But on his turn he could shoot me from where he wasn't.
So I got flanked c.
The other near-death was just carelessness.
And damn sapper conflicts with holo-targeting? C.
Sapper or grenadiers every time IMHO.
You can get holo targeting in a few places.
But if you want to blow something up.
You really need to blow it up.
Council Mission to rescue VAN DOORN.
Is there anything in particular that has people Xing COMs?
Not really any particular event.
So then i decided too too.
I should too but eh.
Now I kinda want to.
Probs just going to play another planet of BE though.
So last night we spent a few hours coming up with better mission name lists together.
Though ours not identical.
I should play more Dragonfall but instead Im either going to write more SR or look over things to do and get during campaign downtime.
Noelor recent Beaglerush vids and the ADVENT teaser thing got me in the mood to finish the campaign I was on. And now I finished it I can try Long War.
Apparantly todays stream is sponsered by 90s music videos.
Tune in for hearthstone stay for the backstreet boys.
I'm still not entirely convinced Advent's XCOM though if it is it's totally Apocalypse.
Noelor did you see the last thing i said about it last night ?
FUn if it was but Im not getting my hopes up vOv.
About also thinking it'd be apocalypse and apocalypse being rad?
<- about this.
I mean it could be like Here's a console exclusive XCom title! or something like that.
Mass Com an epic story where you play as a lone surviving XCom grunt.
MairBear you'll want to tune in now just to see frodan.
He took out the fangs.
Missed it by seconds then.
I blame Liquidhearth for not having a correct link.
Also my XCOM just froze on the enemy turn C.
Infinite calculating loop etc.
If you are intersted.
I shall be in the mumble.
So dad came home from Legoland today. With a lot of stuff.
Apparently not all of it is his.
Although then I discovered the goddamn Lego Helicarrier D.
That's a rather big slave I.
Yeah that's the UCS one I think.
That bookcase is also a-z neat.
Why shouldn't it be really? P.
Grouping by genre grouping by who's books they are in multi-occupant.
Frequent use such that ones come in and out.
Granted mine is grouped by Fiction/Fact and then A to Z after that.
Bookcase collapses and they need restacking and you just put them up any old order.
Mine is grouped by whatever happened to come to my hand while I was stacking this shelf.
Except for discworld books. I mean they still follow the same pattern but at least they are mostly grouped together.
Granted then I have half a shelf dedicated to manga and the rest is 40k books.
I'm amazed I've managed to squeeze in four shelves in my room.
MoonWolf can zombies climb ladders or jump?
MoonWolf Terrormission.jpg.
Guess I wont finally play witcher after all.
I had forgotten how crash prone it was with horrible loading times.
Trying this memory patch thing if this doesnt fix it fuck it moving straight to witcher 2.
Well I say straight in 4 hours once it finishes downloading.
Actually tomorrow since I will be sleeping by that point.
Noelor On a scale of 1 to.
GlennCuttlefish while I remember I'm telling you what I just told Mair Mage will be set in 2005 still Hiroshima and it will not be assumed that everyone can understand Japanese though I'm not going to make you bend over backwards for it.
Also because Mage has an in-built organisational structure it shall be assumed that the Council of Traditions has somehow summoned the number of players of you to investigate a lack of communication from the local mages' chantry - the Ascension War is still raging after all.
What in the ever-living shite.
Not sure I get the engineers part.
Jesus christ this is horrifying.
Ah VIC well whadya know.
I hate when my morbid curiosity gets the better of me...
MoonWolf that one exact card etc.
That deck is all about just never giving up the board.
2 dupe rares and finally my first Force of Nature as a reward though.
I wish i got fucking pack dailies.
Viagame banter has started MoonWolf.
Just chat for now though.
K thanks for the heads up.
I thought i twas in 30 minutes.
What happened to the fancy clothes.
I mean we had Thijs video.
Which was him touring medieval torture chambers?
How do your Tour badly ?
Well if you see the vid you'll understand xD.
So i'm pretty sure Amaz had the worst round of 16 performance in the tournament.
Results showed him coming ahead of froggy in his group.
But froggy is literally the youngest pro hearthstone player.
And amaz is considered top tier.
I'll be in mumble if you care at all.
Amaz tilted by broken chicken promises.
The Incredibles is so great.
A pretty terrible christmas movie though.
Because while it might have a higher body count than die hard. It's not Die Hard.
Well fine just add a bunch of snow everywhere.
But oh no! thats not snow! thats cocaine!
I dont know man I didn't do it.
Also slept something like 5 hours.
Noelor its a dynamic action game.
Aw man check this guy out.
A skull LORD in fact!
He does look very lordy.
So according to my dad I probably would've gotten the Lego Shield Heli Carrier I'd asked him about it. Oh well there's always Christmas v.
So instead I got another Creator box which is always nice.
MoonWolf turns out the know all the coastlines perk also reveals the locations of all the coral and algae on a planet.
Hm plane car or robot. That is the question.
Meanwhile in Fate Stay Night shit gets unlimited.
Have not watched this weekends.
Vodafone randomly increasing my bill by Â£6 a month the dicks.
OTOH my energy bills are down the expected ~23% from changing plans.
Explorer on a few hp I tell it to go somewhere it'll take three turns to get.
Pathfinding moves it thre through miasma.
Come hang with us on mumble Noelor ?
MoonWolf its been 2 years since I bought nishkriya.com o_0.
Still not exalted 3.
Cooked_Auto great good thanks John Oliver.
How can you skip a video where someone uses an Onion article as evidence of an apparent conspiracy.
Wait..how long have I been sitting here with 2 pairs of headphones on.
Are they plugged in?
Yes just not to the same device.
Also no signal in one of them.
In this episode of panties line the plot still continues to thicken.
As do the amount of panties?
Is that a snes lasergun ?
Which is also a weapon in Splatoon afaik.
I dont think snes had a gun in that shape.
Looks more like the nes zapper.
Oh yeah the SNES one was the tube.
Yeah snes had the SUPER SCOPE.
You got a pistol? Fuck you SNES had a BAZOOKA.
God that was a shitty gun tbh.
This is the best.
Its really hard to get first dates as a dragon.
Eh depends. I mean if you're a trickster dragon it's easy since you can just fool your date.
<- i have no clue hwo legetimate this is.
THat's a ridiculous box for a tabletop game.
But if swords are in i'm all for that.
Motherfucking sectiod hybrids and snakemen.
There is a helicarrier.
Although if there is one thing that the Marvel movies has gotten right it is the Helicarrier. Fallen so much in love with how that one looks any other design just looks bad.

Curved swords mod pls.
Trailer makes me hype.
Also know as q2 next year.
Because videogames and delays.
Can't wait for Bradford to kill most of my guys in the tutorial.
That helicarrier better have shen valen and bradford on it.
One of them with an eyepatch.
20 years from now.
So shen will be in a robot.
But otherwise make it so.
Shen will be a robot.
Valen will have jumpylegs and a superbrain.
Oh it will have Mod support. Myes. 40k mod when?
Looking at the screenshot SunTiger.
1 Leg of Chicken.
8 Poisoned Leg of Chicken.
Odd hotbar actions B.
Those are drones i think.
Like you call in a drone.
And it does a thing.
I like what I see so far though if that is even just WIP representative of the UI.
I like comprehensive why I'm Hitting This Well figures without menu scrolling.
Numbers not being hidden in a sub menu is goood.
Hm... that doesnt look that bad.
I can admit that is a drawback.
That's why speaking Belgian is better. It's exactly like Dutch except we don't choke when we talk. v.
Maybe the flemish just don't know how to speak properly.
For someone who isn't actually geralts daughter she sure has his hair.
Side effect of becoming a witcher afaik.
Same with the eyes.
I thought there was witchers with normal hair.
From the games i only know 2 with white-ish hair.
And vesimir is just fucking old.
Then again according to the official cosplay reference Ciri's hair is not white but ashen blond.
Oh no exalted tonight.
But with sword so who's even mad.
GlennCuttlefish I sent you a link to the dropbox folder at kain@frikki - there's a briefing doc.
But my aim is chargen this week or next start the game next week or week after.
Cooked_Auto that checks out.
My brother sent me Dixit.
So now I own that \o/.
But with sword so who's even mad <- i will be if there are no robots with puncy fists AND swords.
Cooked_Auto it's a rather pretty game.
SunTiger ok yeah robot swords are an as-yet unconfirmed must-have.
Needs more Space Marines with chainswords I.
...XCOM doesn't really have space marines though?
Well with modding tools I am hoping for a 40k mod because why not.
Noelor sure but could you send it to kain@friikki.net instead.
Oh wait its there.
Just miraculously not first on the list.
Yeah I was going to say.
Because what I actually did was copy+paste from the other folder.
The XCOM Helicarrier is called the Avenger. Teehee.
Cooked_Auto reference to old xcom actually.
I mean its a nice coincidence.
But they didn't just call their helicarrier the avenger because avengers.
I recall the transport or something in the first game was called Avenger but Im still amused.
Its the ship they send to mars.
Though GTAO has of course done rather better than APB. Admittedly dead and rotting crustaceans have more fans than APB did on release poor APB =<.
I know. I sorta enjoyed that game for a while.
Scottish gamemaking at its finest p.
No ranks in disguise.
Lets clal it that.
Well thats the second most rambling text concerning giant glaciers i've seen.
A proge rock song by kingston wall.
For the actual song.
<- an xcom screenshot showing off good hair options.
I killed a Seige Worm! \o/.
And the aliens are still green somehow afterwards.
ChaosSmurf New Hannibal on thursday btw.
Finally starting the research for floatstone quarries.
That is one fucking fancy looking cake.
MoonWolf I found out why the optical surgery requires Firaxite.
Turns out I'm not making glasses there I'm just straight-up replacing my citizens' eyes.
They were not supreme enough.
I'm choosing to limit it to scientists ie the nerds who'd be totally into that.
I think I've lost this though =<.
You may yet pull through.
I have 13 turns left to shut down China's The Beacon.
I left it too long to try because I made 2/6 of the other nations declare war on her instead.
Not realising they'd... completely ignore her victory condition.
That does sound like a loss.
Just remembered Tseric existed.
Gonna try and find him.
See if he wants to do an interview about going mental.
Oh and I have to navigate my Oversser past a kraken to get to it now.
Well that Project Titan launch event was a disappointment.
Based on Smurfles tweets it seemed like a huge embarassment.
Well lasted 90 mins 45 mins was a set from 'Madeon' an 'electro-house' artist from France.
MoonWolf you know the fountain map?
10 thin men and 5 seekers.
It was my first non tuturial xcom map.
This is just ... not going my way.
They had Turpster in playing a round with Yogscast but they didn't show any gameplay.
Sounds like most youtube LPs to me.
There was the in-engine trailer for the D3 Crusader import.
BwaS that doesn't sound like blizzard launches at all.
Who the fuck organized that.
Some digital artist making a custom piece who had the caster come up to him every 5 minutes for a progress update.
Are they doing that thing again where they aren't expecting their side-game to take off so aren't investing hard?
No I think they're StarCraft2'ing this HotS.
Lead dev Dustin Browder shouted a bit about how awesome the game is.
Madeon was really good.
But the rest was completely pointless.
There was one brief couple minute segment of a clever light-show projected on a wall contributed to by big data and social media engagement.
Oh and the stream sound cut out for couple of minutes during his set which was hilarious.
Tbh the Heart of the Swarm launch was pretty bad too.
But at least had like a tournament and stuff.
Launch events have never been good.
So I dunno if that's slipping.
The best launch event was Reaper of Souls.
Because I sat at my computer and it unlocked at worked 100% immediately.
That is basically what you need in a luanch event.
And then everyone gets to play the game.
And then instant gratification.
MoonWolf Tom Scott is still in your country finding it weird.
Noelor he's easily weirded out.
Also he can't pronounce dutch anythings.
Also whats with his scar.
When did that happen.
When he was in Italy.
At the start of this European tour that apparently he's on.
He went to a funfair made entirely of scrap metal.
I see where this is going.
Including a pedal-powered loop-de-loop ride.
And then he fell off a slide there.
Cue blood ambulance etc.
Oh yeah saw that one.
He should do more rants about programming complicated things.
So this stuff with Arya in Bravos right.
Is this ahead of the books?
Haven't seen tonight's yet but last I watched they were still at AFFC Arya content and I think she gets chapters in ADWD.
MoonWolf Got my first EXALT encoder defense. Looks simple enough.
Encoder defenses are the prefered.
Oh except 4 rocket launchers... and apparently EXALT has pinpoint precision.
1 turn 3 dead from full o.
Thats was not my experience.
In 3 rockets. Rather than a single clumped group.
MoonWolf you don't happen to know Bashiok's e-mail address do you.
I COULDA TOLD YOU KARUNE'S CIRCA 2010.
Cooked_Auto the Australia drawer.
Speculation in /r/hots the heroes youtube stream getting muted mid-show was due to copyright infringement.
MoonWolf I kinda remade it and cheesed the mission hard B.
Full on charge the EXALT ignoring taking cover.
And just pinging between all beacons.
I think when I mailed Karune in 2008 about a camera I Lost it was on my yahoo account.
And that has since locked me out.
So can't see what the syntax of Blizzard e-mails was.
So that's the deal with that steel.
So apparently Windows now has a little Hey Buy Windows 10 button on my start bar V.
Young bashiok is pleased.
1844 ChaosSmurf Mage y/n?
I have so much work this week.
And would like it to stay that way so I can live.
You moving within Glasgow after all btw?
4's better but 3's minimum.
Clcl beats the extortionate south.
4 > 3 > 5 > more than 5 > less than 3.
I kinda feel like 5 > 3.
Unless DnD in which case 5 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> all other numbers.
But have not been able to get 5 for years.
I might move again.
If I get a job or it's shit or whatever.
People have been suggesting I try to find a flatmate and buy a 2-bed.
But I basically cba.
We'll see what happens though going to start hunting properly this week I hope.
Noelor>> have been through tonight's episode can confirm they're still in written content for arya at this point and there's a bit to come.
SGDQ must be soon.
0029 people have been suggesting I try to find a flatmate and buy a 2-bed <--- buy.
RANGERS are the England of Scotland it was claimed last night.
Experts said the savage violence casual racism and fanatical love of the monarchy confirmed the long-held theory that Rangers fans are essentially England supporters with foreign accents.
Meanwhile England's biggest professional football gangs are hoping to sign up some of Rangers' most viscious maniacs.
Wayne Hayes a leading Chelsea psycopath said We've been very impressed. They really just need some elecution lessons and a BMW.
Dwayne â€œThe Rockâ€ Johnson is in negotiations to star in and produce a remake of John Carpenterâ€˜s cult classic â€œBig Trouble in Little Chinaâ€ that will be written by â€œX-Men First Classâ€ scribes Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz multiple individuals familiar with the project have told TheWrap.
Good lord Jade Star. An hour long video? D.
Found Tseric or someone with the right work history that looks similar.
Yeah the one who lost it.
I'm trying to track him down if he wants to talk about it for a piece.
Cooked_Auto this better be the last mission.
Cooked_Auto i see the guy sitting inside the gollop chamber pool bug has STRUCK AGAIN.
So this is a video.
These Eve changes seem pretty big.
I think the followup is better SunTiger.
Eve wants the Star Citizen audience?
ChaosSmurf truely the embodyment of post game player interview.
90% of the questions are the same and 90% of the awnsers are the same.
Star citizen has an audience?!
Why do people have these damn things.
GlennCuttlefish rich people who can't afford to go TO space.
Sounds like they need to stop being so lazy and get richer '.
And then go to space.
At least that way they can get something.
Mairnai could you tell me next time you HS i need to see someone win a game.
Thats asking a lot of Mair.
I'm confident he can manage.
Wait theres more after chapter 2? oh noooo.
Damn you witcher for continuing.
SunTiger I'll try now.
Need to clear quests.
This is definitly an arena deck.
That was some luck.
Velen's chosen is just so strong.
Got two epics southsa captain and ancient of war.
Muster quartermaster'd in arena.
Large building will require entry- says mission control. So I prepare for there to be no long spaces.
It's the goddamn subway D.
Mairnai think of all the sandwhiches!
Maybe i'll....Make a pie.
Sounds like a plan boss.
Op. Lightly Braised Sectoid.
It'll be very dumb.
Just remember some new weather.
!weather remember Newcastle Upon Tyne.
Mairnai ^ ^ ^.
Man I have no idea how this thing will turn out.
For that type of dough it seemed entirely too damp.
I don't know if we've mentioned enough operations that you'll get any unique ones.
Well its a good thing I could not care less about anything ubi does at this point.
And now I have a good reason to skip the ubi conference as well.
Man this pie feels weird even before its done.
But fuck it I'll eat it. And like it. Uphill. Both ways.
What did you doooooo? D.
It just seems weird. and mostly I dont think I leavened the dough enough. also the dough has a ton of basil in it.
So there is a whole lot of basil in it.
So basically theres flour butter and a bit of salt in the dough. also a lot of basil.
As the filling I first used sun dried tomatoes and not-feta cheese.
Then I covered that in mixture of eggs cream cheese and pesto.
Mozzarella cheese I think?
If you want an all-female all-Portuguese team you can do that obviously the biggest feature lacking from EW.
Mairnai I'm planning to be on mumble Thursday night to talk chargen if you want to have a browser through the character chapters before that?
Also GlennCuttlefish who already knows what's up in Mage.
Err. Kinda do kinda dont. I mean I have gone through that process years ago.
But mage always was weird for me for various reasons.
Also the other guy who I'll be sorting out mumble aptitude with.
GlennCuttlefish well then also you!
But I meant more setting than rules.
Well I am familiar with the idea but I expect less ninjas this time round.
Will there be less ninjas.
Yeah there will probably be... Three ninjas max.
Only 3?! How rubbish.
To clarify again though Mage setting in general not Hiroshima.
Mairnai so i just had a mission i which i went through 4 pods in 4 turns.
My sniper rifle NEVER left her spawn point.
Like if I say Janos the other guy is considering an Ecstatic or Hermes mage you have an idea what that means right?
Also someone explain to me why does my phone crash if I use my carriers internet connection listen to music and browse the net.
But works fine if I just use w-lan instead.
Cooked_Auto looks like a useful book.
Bow chicka bow wow.
Hm...This pie is okay. Should have used more tomatoes I guess.
Of all the tastes you could have you chose salt. P.
I am not sure how well a sweet feta pie would turn out.
Browder has lost so much fuckin' weight.
Also the ending of that video is immense.
Since i'm watching it now.
Mairnai it happened Operation Uncaring Council.
Okay that ending was pretty good ChaosSmurf.
Do you really mean though ?
Would you guess have been announced since February.
A bunch. I mean that depends on how wide of a search you wanna do.
Do you want to include indie games or just major titles? As I assume there is a lot of smaller games being announced a lot of the time.
Everything that's even vaguely interesting and hasn't already been released in a 1.0 version.
So indie games but nothing that's obviously pooped out in half an hour.
F2P and boxed releases but not just totally free stuff unless it's super interesting.
ANYWAY THE POINT IS.
I would have thought like 50-100 max right?
I am at 200 and counting.
Neat I guess. Doubt even half of those will be really brought into attention or finished tbh.
Well fine crash on me witcher.
I really cba to do anything tonight.
Then dont do anything vOv.
I need to practice guitar though.
GlennCuttlefish Now you can play Harvest Moon on the PC without emulator!
But why would I ever do that.
Fire Emblem waifu harder.
I always lose it.
Nope still not firefox.
Several machines were being designed to get the actors covered in dirt however Charlize Theron decided it would be easier to just show up five minutes early to each shoot and roll around in the dirt on set. Other cast members followed her example D.
ChaosSmurf free on the 12th?
<- guess he learned from the dwemer.
Because he thistles while he works.
Wait fuck that doesn't work. For some reason I remember the whistle while you work number was by the dwarves in snow white.
<- it had to happen.
This pleases me greatly.
It even synchs up the rules of nature with the sword slash.
Which is why its great.
Not going to lie RULES OF NATURE is the only thing that would drag me back to wow at this point.
...and even that is doubtful since I am playing ff14 now. Enjoying it overall more but its impossible to RULES OF NATURE properly in it.
Quick someone post that dio squick pick again.
Dont have time to go through logs.
You've managed to hit the window before E3/move and after all this work shouldbe done.
Now I just hope the streamer dies to tentacles again.
Alawys worth asking eh.
Purposely evolved to make XCOM soldiers feel awkward inside.
PORN WHEN? Porn Noow.
This is the danger of giving everything boobs.
Well I say danger.
Love starts blooming on the battlefield ?
That's not even porn v.
I cant deny this one.
GlennCuttlefish why the mongol mongol.
ChaosSmurf aye booze although not loads I have a 4 hour car journey on the 13th.
Moonwolf for some reason internet has decided that Finns are in fact mongols.
Maybe I should not have eaten a whole sleeping pill a few hours ago.
Wait we're in june already?!
Guess that does explain the greenery outside.
Are in the not cold months.
Well time to celebrate summer by having a cup of coffee some pie and a smoke on the porch.
Hey its green and relativly warm here.
I wish it was raining just now. also my plans of drawing were foiled by my pencil disappearing. had to come back inside to find a new one |.
Drink that with vodka flavoured cigarettes.
I have never come across a good tobacco flavor.
Tried looking for one when my e-cig still worked none of them were any good.
82 has waaaay to many eyes.
So it can look at you better.
Yes close range deal with it.
That still says today cool.
I assume Minister means the todays session.
Note to self/mages Alertness is mundane spot Awareness is supernatural spot.
So to see someone hiding you need to be alert but if they're invisible you need to be aware.
What if they're hiding while being invisible.
Minister Dropbox tells me I was invited but all I can acess are two character sheets. And it tells me an error occured c.
You can't argue with that logic.
I'm going to wite the lewdest self published fap fiction.
Dutch Windmill Butt Invasion.
It'll be about a straight modern day man with an average income and job having consensual sex in a bedroom with an average woman with a regular job and income.
In the missionary for procreational purposes.
And they're married too!
Lets not forget they should also hold hands!
And by which I think we've hit all the points for that joke.
Why the hell is there a discussion comparing smoking weed to necrophilia on my facebook feed.
Because weed is eeeeeeviiiiiiil.
It'll kill you! And your parents! And your dog too!
I'd have said because weed jokes are as funny as necrophilia ones.
Sounds like a win-win for the necrophiliacs then.
Hey necrophilia jokes can be hilarious.
They sound kinda stiff to me.
They just require a rotten sense of humor.
I dunno they just leave me cold.
I do now have Dead Girls in my head though...
Well done I guess.
I dunno they just leave me cold <- fucking you're fired MairBear.
Clean out your desk.
If you want to be hype about fallout 4.
It'll be hard with xcom2 though.
Dropbox is being weird.
There should only be one sheet for one thing.
A sheet a book and a .txt.
A fucking war never changes.
Get out fallout 4.
What the the fuck you expect?
Wait that vault character cant be the MC. He talks v.
MoonWolf I think I need to start a new Long War from scratch c.
I've shot down 3 ufo's I just encountered UFO 22.
Guess you've missed a bunch.
They keep beating me or escaping or being too big D.
You got off to a terrible start.
Normally you should be just fine on the first 2 months with just you know.
Regular old 0 to 2 kill interceptors.
Make sure to buy up to 6.
You need them for the volume.
Yeah I even got phoenix cannons installed and they'd flash in that one more shot will do it way.
And then either I ran out of interceptors or they ran out of the radar.
Where getting kicked in the nuts repeatedly is half the fun.
The other half is operation names.
Its like you scrubs don't enjoy roguelikes or something.
MairBear were you using avalanche/stingray's properly ?
<- this page read it.
Why is it SO CUTE.
Clearly a failed SAN rool.
263 Hours Played <- thats a lot of hours in roll 20.
Aw only 70 hours for me.
So MoonWolf which bits of gamebryo do you think they will improve for FO4?
Really hope thats not gamebryo though.
You've got ID just steal what they are doing.
Unlikely to be id.
Anathema uhm.... you um.
Did you read that fist sentence ?
The megatexture direction in id Tech 5 has some big wins but it's also fairly restrictive on certain types of games he said. It would be a completely unacceptable engine to do Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V Skyrim in where you've got the whole world walking across these huge areas.
<- well this is a THING.
Alice madness returns. Not symbolic at all.
I certainly don't see any symbolism.
Nooope no symbolism there nosiree.
So the Viper's tongue actually is 10m long and prehensile.
Rory off Dr Who is in the new CW show.
And it's about time travel.
And the dead Black Canary is back.
And I am so hype.
Dob when's your last exam?
Do Mad Max at the weekend.
If you don't have anything else planned.
Hmm I have had it mind to see it.
The internet is not shutting up about it very much.
That is indeed a thing the internet is not doing.
That happens when tumbler encounters a feminist masterpiece.
I have a uni social in town saturday 5pm but I think otherwise clean.
Masterpiece is I expect an exaggeration of truly tumblry proportions.
But i heard it has good explosions.
I have boring grown-up stuff to do in town on Sat talking to my bank about my mortgage potential.
Which makes up for a lot.
Explosions are a lot like feminism.
Maybe tumblr got confused.
That is the boringest of grown-up stuff I am impressed.
Also in other news sunnycon are now sold out of saturday tkts wknd and sunday day passes remain.
What's the price difference?
Tenner 15 vs 25.
Explosions are a lot like feminism <- what short lived and destructive?
Straight from noelors mouth.
Definitely what I said.
They get trampled by horses?
Wait horses trample explosions now?
Tenchi Muyo is the nWoD of anime every character coming from a different hypothetical game line/genre to form the party so half of the party is OP and the rest are normal-ish people. And this is why you don't cross over every single line in a game.
That is some bayonetta leg syndrome going on there.
Even Batman has lost count of Robins at this point.
I've lost count of batmans and jokers.
This looks like a Guilty Gear thing but I don't think it is.
Wizards can't use technology.
Also here's a cool HF!Saber.
First one is Kekkai Sensen.
Who is on the right MoonWolf.
I mean what.
Graham McNeill just got hired by Riot.
Riot crashing is going to be fun.
ChaosSmurf they better be working on THE BEST GAME EVER.
With all the talent they are hiring.
I think they must be making a movie or something.
They have SOOOOO many narrative guys.
Is it an override/buyout from GW or just something on the side?
It's a full time job.
He says he'll keep doing GW stuff when he has time.
He's half way through a Horus Heresy novel.
So like Abnett then.
Heard about this algae called spirulina you can buy in powdered form.
Also its an unholy dark green.
Maybe just mixing it yoghurt is bad.
First result on google.
Has CAPTCHA gone too far?
Anathema that looks DISGUSTING.
It tastes pretty bad too.
Why are you eating paint anathema.
Anathema why are you eating bacterial paint.
>57g protein per 100g mass.
'nother overwatch vid.
Saw it was pretty boring imho.
Watch the men fall over.
Shoot some more men.
Probably fun to play.
Press your ultimate to shoot lots of men in a cyclone.
I want a Pharah vid.
But I think she needs buffed.
She needs some way not to die while airborne at least.
She's been in like.
And all she does is use her ult and then die immediately.
Justice Rains From Above ChaosSmurf.
Except for one where she caught people unaware and got like a triple kill.
She's all Look I can fly!
And everyone else is Look an easy target on her own in the sky without cover!
Focussing on opponent popping an ult? heresy.
Except for Winston and... the knight whassname.
She's my favourite design tho so.
Dob you can't do the same to like.
Because most people have hit scan stuff.
...basically any other ult I think.
You can focus them.
You can't do it from outside their engagement range quite as well.
Like you can focus reaper but he can move.
And is doing damage around him cosntantly.
Tracer and Hanzo I think just have instant ults.
And yeah a bunch of them are just like My Large Move.
His ult is actually just loadsa healing isn't it?
Pharah is of course now crushing the perspective character in this video.
Yeah it's a big AoE around him.
That he can't fight during.
It's v possible that Pharah is like Scout/Spy.
Where if you don't know what you're doing you're completely useless.
But I doubt it.
Tracer seems that way.
Yeah her guns do not do a lot of damage.
But that's hardly the first Tracer/Scout comparison.
ChaosSmurf we're on mumble.
Now talking about Overwatch instead of playing gaem.
I am working when I'm not watching this video.
His ult needs more feedback.
His guns in general.
But do loads of damage.
Scout kinda had that issue too.
The heat vision thing?
I actually have no idea.
I will look it up.
Overwatch.com and overwatchgame.com are both not-blizzard.
Yeah it gives her a wall hack.
Wow I hadn't actually watched any of her shit before she's rad.
It gives her team a wallhack.
Okay that's dumb as fuck.
It's shown up in a few of the videos.
Ah she has the sniper charge thing.
But it's suuuupppperrrr fast.
Sniper in TF2 has a stronger shot the longer you stay scoped.
And so does Widowmaker.
I might be full of shit.
Okay it says power.
But she never shoots before it's at 100%.
~shame about her design lol~.
Whats wrong with the design.
She's a slutty assassin.
I am not seeing the problem yet.
As a basic description it's probably the most boring OW character.
It gets a lot worse before it has to get better.
And tbh if they moved her neckline up from her navel it'd probably be alright.
Or if there was any sort of reason for her to be wearing a skin tight body suit cloak faster movement air control or something.
ChaosSmurf and maybe not have a suit that literally shapes around her breasts.
Oh wait no you're not talking about that model bug where her breasts got bigger when she shot.
Talking about how her lcothing literally shape around her breasts.
Like beyond comics style.
I dunno if they changed it.
But it doesn't look quite as bad as it used to.
Giver her some support for goodness sake.
2224 oh wait no you're not talking about that model bug where her breasts got bigger when she shot <--- what the fuck.
I can't immediately find that.
Anathema I can't remember what it's called.
There's a name for when models just random move in size.
But I've forgotten the word.
Anyway lots of the sort of people that like to get angry got angry thinking it was deliberate because ???
MoonWolf XCOM reddit.
Maybe not quite sfw.
The various fan interpritations of Vahlen are kinda weird.
Now I am not saying we should play maid.
How rude of me to quit in the middle of mairs sentence.
He was wishing you luck.
MoonWolf what's this Hearthstone thing.
Is it a tease.
Cause I thought I just didn't get it.
But now PCG are telling me it's a tease.
I bet he's gone to bed.
Went to bed a while ago.
Oh god. Operation Sexy Entries.
!note Noelor pirate or get or just look up the webcomic of or maybe just look at my twitter from tonight for Starpunch Girl. Rad shit.
Pro jojo cosplay.
Not what i wanted hexchat.
Ananda Gupta apparantly working for Riot too now.
Riot A Developer Black Hole.
A developer on xcom enemy unknown/within.
So last night a strummed AND sang in guitar class.
And the instructor was all 'those chord progressios were great I can see youve been practising \o/.
And also not to be mean but it would be better if you could sing in tune V.
I can't sing I am fully aware of this.
Vb tip if you're working with dates always use value2 instead of value.
The only difference between the functions being how they handle dates.
Oh god functions with numbers in them.
Untidy bad name doesn't really tell you much kludge for a lack of function overloading or parametric polymorphism.
>Call a company in Fife.
>Goes through to an office in Birmingham.
Wait what O_o.
!note MairBear One Shiv Vs Confounding Light My luckiest mission.
Joel McHale will play Tad Oâ€™Malley the anchor of a popular conservative internet news network who becomes an unlikely ally for Fox Mulder yess.
Yeah it keeps valen busy.
Do I want to ask?
MairBear <- so this is a thing.
Also thanks to xcom 2 i now know this subreddit exists.
MairBear did you restart your LW btw ?
Making it even longer!
Such a master plan.
The woman who works next to me is reading the newspaper.
And I spotted a headline that was something like Sylvia's Sex Change Taints the Green Party.
And I don't know the context.
And can't read the story.
But now I'm just upset and that's a bit rubbish.
Its probably a dumb article.
MoonWolf 6 sectoids 3 floaters.
That is some serious meld.
Mm Jurassic World next week >.
Time for some sexy sexy Chris Pratt.
Will probably go and see on Thursday Wednesday is 13th Age so.
MoonWolf I really hope that's them releasing alternate hero powers.
Or just redesigning heroes entirely.
The 2 mana powers thing was cool when the game was new.
But I think it's not flexible enough.
And you could do lots of cool shit with a system closer to WoW's.
At the very least it'll be more way to sarcastically congratualate your opponent.
Maybe they'll add auto-squelch and nobody will have to die.
Helps my Hearthstone on consoles E3 theory too.
You don't tease stuff this close to E3 that isn't at E3.
And I don't think they'd go to E3 for non-console news.
You do just release stuff this close to E3 but they aren't just releasing.
THEN AGAIN up until this year I wouldn't have said this number of devs would do big reveals this close to E3.
And I'm hoping it means everyones got loads to say and not just the more likely realisation that E3 is trash.
Minister I left Noelor a note you will like.
Like i find HS on consoles completly plausible.
I'm just not sure how this works into it. They could just be hyping up the next expansion at e3 as part of some general blizzard panel.
ChaosSmurf this morning after I read Starpunch Girl v1?
MoonWolf I tweeted about it last night.
Beyond a girl.. who punches... stars ?
And haven't tweeted much since so you should be able to scroll back.
ChaosSmurf look you're a nice guy but you tweet hundreds of things a day.
Don't go into tweets and replies.
I'm sorry i don't read them all.
LOOK I KNOW THAT.
That's why I'm informing that today is not one of those days.
If you don't go into replies.
Just tell us you lazy git.
That was not hard.
Their website was slow and bad and not veryw ell laid out and I think my tweets were better.
Anyway the reason it's Hearthstone on consoles rather than a genreal Blizzard thing is Blizzard doesn't do general Blizzard things at E3 or at least they never have since I've been paying attention.
Like I legit think the last time they were at E3 for something related to a PC-only game was WoW.
HS expansion that also happens to be the console expansion?
Also of all the platforms.
Surely console is worst for hs.
Sure but if your idea is to just be EVERYWHERE.
They already do pc phones tablets.
Honestly would not suprise me to see console.
And since they use unity.
Console ports besides UI are trivial.
Sure but the ui though.
Playing against a console owner would be ever slower than playing against a phoner.
You can only have x cards in hand y cards on field.
But you can't quickly make arbitrary movements.
Do you need to?
Either its going to go with a selector system.
Or with moving a cursor on screen with a stick.
And both are a lot slower than dragging or mousing.
Both of those are pretty easy.
A selector system can be faster.
I played a hell of a lot of a yu-gi-oh game on my phat DS it works.
Sure it works just fine.
I just meant from an opponents perspective.
When playing against them they're going to be taking actions slowly. compared to a pc user or tablet user.
I actually think it will be faster than a tablet I found HS really awkward on a 7 screen.
Isn't 7 a phone?
I mean I agree that'd be awkward.
7 is a tablet.
Oh okay my phone is 5.
I'm bad at diagonals.
Or inches I guess.
Newest iPhone might be 7!
<- panicked? More like critical.
Distinct lacking of honking.
MairBear Operation Holla Holla Get Good.
Operation No Steak is all I get.
It's just new art.
Instead of actually change.
Ahahaha they're 10 dollars.
$10 for a different portrait and voice?
And some changed animations and a card back.
It's hammer time just stop.
Just sit down and stop Blizzard.
If it's gonna cost money then thank god it's only skins and hats.
Yeah I wouldn't want them to charge for classes I suppose.
ChaosSmurf well they were going to have to monetize cosmsetics at some point.
The point has arrived.
Very much like the Carrier the point has arrived.
MairBear GlennCuttlefish I'll be in the mumble for the rest of the evening for chargen stuff.
Janos will be joining shortly as well and getting to grips with mumble config.
Whats there to grip ?
But he only installed it today so.
Right will join you shortly. clearing this crypt in witcher first.
Making sure his mic settings are right and w/e.
The tallest waterfall in the Netherlands is a lovely stepped feature that is only 50 feet tall.
So S6 of Archer is probably the best yet.
Goddammit Mair you have the worst timing.
MoonWolf Gabriella is the best dragon.
She takes none of the sisters shit.
He was praising Archer.
GlennCuttlefish Have a cool gun.
Will check it out when I have lunch its on my feed C_A.
And I thought my body clock was whacked out.
He's finnish. They're just weird like that.
Noelor can my character be called Jugemu Jugemu GokÅ-no surikire Kaijarisuigyo-no SuigyÅmatsu Unraimatsu FÅ«raimatsu Kuunerutokoro-ni Sumutokoro YaburakÅji-no burakÅji Paipopaipo Paipo-no-shÅ«ringan ShÅ«ringan-no GÅ«rindai GÅ«rindai-no PonpokopÄ«-no PonpokonÄ-no ChÅkyÅ«mei-no ChÅsuke?
The name pretty much requires a sheet of its own.
It's only slightly longer than Roselyn's.
That doesn't even seem that hard except for a few parts...
Cooked_Auto why are you in a fuck the ocean threa.
Apparently something related to the Aquaman movie.
Apparently the guy making it quoted Lovecraft on twitter.
Cooked_Auto>> think it's this.
I was figuring it was that one.
Mair's mage has the same family name as the archer girl NPC.
Æ£® Mori English equivalent would be Wood or Woods.
I'll probably change the NPC accordingly.
Because while it's a pretty common name.
It's pretty dumb for the story.
Mori-san you and Mori-san...
I had no heavy attachment to it I can change x3.
You chose it because it sounds nice with the given name right?
I literally just chose it by asking my brother what the most common family name he could think of off the top of his head was.
And cos it was common xD.
Well it sounds better with Hiromi than Tsukihara.
So I'll find something else.
Operation Mediocre Strange Mountain. And it's the Chrysallid Hive.
Well things took an interesting turn in Shadowrun. The team just walked into a trap and got captured except one.
And the only remaining team member is the new hacker is the Doof.
*the new hacker the Doof.
That name implies great things about him.
He's based on the guitarist in Fury Road.
Mori-san you and Mori-san... <- Mori and MORI.
Its so cute.
What an adorable piece of bacon.
The title line of the latest Daft Souls seems to be XCOM 2 Fallout 4 XCOM 2 XCOM 2 XCOM 2.
Which is fair enough.
Now I am not saying witcher is buggy but I am getting tired of all these bugs.
Even if the one previous to this one benefitted me. Went to loot a sack it was full of rune swords for some reason.
Sadly this latest one just spawns me inside a house on the outdoors map meaning I cant go into that house ever again or fear getting stuck inside its walls.
Anathema how goes the quest to eat digusting green stuff ?
MoonWolf milk did not work going to try water with sweetener tonight. Also considering a green tea based smoothie.
Currently angry at tyranids though.
All these spore mines.
Hayfever time woo |.
Wait are those related.
Are you blaming Tyranid spores for your hay fever?
I might buy a HEPA filter for my bedroom.
Heavily Enhanced Poppy Aura?
Hundreds Eat Potatoes Aggressively.
Fuck it ordered. will arrive tomorrow.
Gotta love amazon prime.
Lost connection to everything but my ISP's IRCnet server.
Which itself split from every network.
Your isp has an irc ?
My ISP has an IRC server on IRCnet yes.
First person waving action!
Not quite first person hug-you're-.
Stupid backspace right next to return grumble grumble.
I should play that game again.
It was really rather good.
It really sounds like the most unholy brew ever.
Janos' witch has Correspondence 1.
Also known as a cellphone.
This means searching for baddies' hairs to cast magic at them.
Or other body parts I guess.
Because fluids are also very valid and a pretty classic case.
Must deny the enemy our bodily fluids.
She also has Mind 1 which... is probably the most powerful sphere to have just 1 in on its own.
Read emotions read auras sense surface thoughts.
Oh and also it gives psychic shielding and lets you overclock your brain.
Mind 1 is p great.
And her 3 is Time which... is going to be interesting.
No time *travel* but bullet time and short-term rewind.
Punch peoples hair in the feelings in the past.
Time also lets her cast delayed spells.
Ok also unless GlennCuddlefish breaks the pattern so far the group has a total of 0 dots between Firearms Martial Arts Melee and Brawl.
I forsee a lot of magical combat.
Okay let me follow these instructions.

Need to finish this thing an hour ago.
Lots of little things going wrong likle sophos making my builds crawl.
I know that feeling.
Mairnai while my itnernet was pretending to not exist i got Operation Tepid Tea.
Oh god I haven't merged master in weeks.
MoonWolf arc thrower is total XCOM in this C.
58% 4 missions in a row 0 aliens caught. And now the thing got damage D.
Never arc thrower unless you can either kill it this turn or can ensure it does nothing at all.
Also interesting perk interaction.
If you have Ranger.
You can arcthrow from range if you have vision.
If you are using the arcthrower in pistol slot ini change.
I did not know it was an option.
But I chased a Muton for about 5 turns that did nothing but run till supression finally killed it.
I really like abduction missions that are small pod right on turn 2 kills it small pod right after you finished pod 1 turn to reload pod 3 paths in to you murder it. done.
No need to find shit at all.
Got all the meld.
Didn't think raid leader doesn't like how a roll is going so takes the loot and runs still happened in wow.
Not that I needed the piece but caused the raid to splinter 3 bosses in to BRF.
Noelor the iteration x tradition art is ridiculous.
Anathema please do not be a Technocrat.
I don't fully get it.
Well time to emergency delete stuff.
There is not enough room to save on hard drive.
Oh hey animes I actually want to see this season. Hooray.
Planning to at least see My Monster Secret Jitsu wa.
Oh yeah I was going to check out Ninja Slayer at some point.
Well no wonder I was running out of space.
With my habit of chronic quick saving my witcher saves folder is 5gigs at this point.
Ember I will not be a technocrat looking at Akashic / Hermes atm.
Oh you're playing as well anathema?
GlennCuddlefish yeah because the only reason I hadn't asked him earlier was I thought he had classes and it turns out he doesn't actually.
Witcher did I miss some plot point or are you bugging out.
So I was told to go find this person.
And suddenly she is some kind of superghost.
Maybe you were just too late.
Anathema I'm not 100% on Glenn's non-magic stats but.
Afaict if you're Akashic you'll be the cabal's go-to mage for anything physically exerting.
And if you're Hermetic you'll be rounding out a full cabal of nerd-mages.
Ooh that's cool too.
Unless I decide to play me-as-a-mage and be a Virtual Adept but I doubt that p.
It is set in 2005.
If that helps one way or the other in relation to VA.
It is also set in Japan so.
Well need to figure out background first will try to get that sorted tomorrow.
I sometimes wish Nintendo would replace the rule of 3 with a rule of 2 Or rules of nature.
Japan 2005 suitable background we're in economic deflation lol.
Well the PCs aren't Japanese with one exception.
!note MairBear not my mission but aptly named.
Man I need a new game for my phone.
The 4 pictures one word thing ran out of words.
Get yourself some classic bejeweled clone.
I could get actual bejeweled but I am kind of tired of that game. Its still a great game but not something I wish to ever play while on the move.
Find a quiz game?
Trying to. only decent one seems to be trivial pursuit which is not free.
Then again its only a couple of euros.
Another problem is that most good games seem to require version 8.1 of the OS which I dont have.
Maybe I should just save for a decent android phone at this point.
Today in dutch news to many people are donating their bodies to science.
So what Dutchland needs is a couple of those bodyfarms where they dump bodies to see how they decompose.
We've got a counter to that in UK.
Apparently blood donation is srsly down.
So in order to do a blood drive ofc it's a social media campaign.
Where they get influential accounts to remove random vowels from their ID w/o explaining why.
That sure would make me want to donate blood.
Anyone know is Gal Civ 3 is any good?
Thanks great input there CA.
You're welcome. Happy to help hun.
Anathema probably ask gimble.
I mean you could look up stuff on the web like a normal person p.
Why are hipster yetis so odd? Because they can't even.
My flcs has a discount on lgbt comics all month.
Including the first volume of Lumberjanes that I just picked up!
Two of the titular group of ladies are in a relationship.
Lumberjanes is p good you guys one of them earns a merit badge for puns called the Pungeonmaster's Badge.
Guess what i'm never raeding.
But also it's really good MoonWolf!
There's a camp of wereboys.
I doubt that somehow.
Boys who turn into rabid men.
At least I think that's what happened.
Could just be regular rabies.
Yeah except it happened to all of them at once and seemingly at the behest of their camp leader who's all super-manly.
So they went from being nice and baking cookies to growling and chasing the girls for... some reason.
At the same time.
It might also just be some weird mind control.
Anathema any progress on Mage?
I'm updating the game file.
Will probably read more tonight.
Noelor what of rote discussions?
I will be on mumble in a few minutes MairBear.
Keith David in in S6 of Community. This is amazing.
I have no clue who that is.
Anderson in Mass Effect.
Also plays himself in Saints Row 4.
He plays himself who is also the vice president.
Also Lana's father in Archer.
Mairnai IGN's livestream showing first gameplay of XCOM 2 starts at 430pm on the 15th Well according to this it starts at 430pm PDT on the 15th 1230am tuesday night for us brits.
Operation Conceived By Racist Undertones.
Rules of Ink!
Oh god the posing.
Also totally the wrong poses I.
!note MairBear Operation Moon Cheese.
He's done well there.
Feels like I'm looking into the weirdest stuff for my writing. Now I'm looking into how to write a beliveable hospital report about injuries.
What are you writing about.
Oh just some character background for Shadowrun.
I really wanted to make the alt-text for the header image of this Unreal Tournament article Necris please.
But I expect I'd get into some sort of trouble.
Im amazed that AccountingNightmare can keep up with the running commentary for her DMC4 videos and the multiple takes.
I'm surprised she's still doing videos.
And still doing DMC4 didn't she start that several years ago.
Yeah then got burned out and wanted to improve her Dante gameplay.
She resumed it last month or so.
Or did you used to be able to ctrl click tabs to close them.
Or is it middle mouse.
It's middle mouse isn't it.
Cooking in space where your food will just fucking leave you.
And your kitchen surface is half velcro.
The best recipes should all include the direction make sure your tortilla doesn't escape.
I feel they should not have too.
MoonWolf Control Paladin vs Control Warrior on ESL...
But yeah both players holding so many reactionary cards.
That was a SUPER intense game. ... no.
My Van Doorn has warped into a train cart.
He still gets turns.
MoonWolf what happens if you end the mission.
Do you have to leave him there?
If it was a mission where i had to get to an extraction point yeah probably.
Luckily that was not the case.
Next mission Van Doorn has fused with the train to become some sentient doom vehicle.
There are some characters in the UT irc.
2056 game of thr0n3z is gunna b3 awes0me 2nite.
This dude legit types like this.
He had comments to make on Lena Headey's bosom but I shan't repeat them.
ChaosSmurf is to classy for that kind of talk.
Or dem dirty tits as he put it.
Meanwhile I'm watching the Watch_Dogs LP.
WHO WAT*strangled to death*.
I must spaceship.
I think we just listened to a faceless NPC commit suicide through her bathroom door via her laptop?
Yeah that was what I got from it took.
Noelor No she chickens out at the end.
Assuming you're near the start.
Noelor my original thought was actually make herself throw up.
But everyone else seems to think suicide.
He just didnt listen through the entire thing but a poster mentions in the thread she doesnt do it.
Cooked_Auto well there is no subsquent sound so.
Hmm trying to think my way through affc/adwd as to what would make thr0n3z awes0me 2nite.
It's the 9th episode.
Dob they're just going off last week.
Plus what ChaosSmurf said.
Mate I'm fucking pumped.
It better be a good ep.
They've set a pattern now.
Can't stop the pattern.
I assume it's the attack on Winterfell.
Given that's what they've built to all season.
Nah last week blew the battle setpiece budget for the season.
Sansa's human shitpile of a husband.
Was going to turn it into a raid on Stannis' camp.
MairBear pro self lethal strats are not in this video.
So we'll probably have that.
BwaS well I assume it has gone up.
And there is more battles.
It might be Cersai's walk of shame whatever that is.
It's been confirmed that whatever it is is in this season.
If it was someone commenting on Lena Headey's assets and given where they were at in 8 possibly.
MoonWolf what is this operation x y z thing you guys have been talking about.
ChaosSmurf we're playing xcom but we modified our mission name lists.
ChaosSmurf they modded XCOM's mission name random generation seed lists.
So we hav better mission names.
Okay I thought it was XCOM.
And thought it was Long War or something.
MAN know what XCOM 2 should have.
But the mission names are not a tall different between long war and ew.
So thats not really a meaningfull difference.
The multiplayer in XCOM was actually fucking great it could've been an esport imo.
MoonWolf yeah that's the part I didn't know.
Anyway operation Moon Cheese is much better than operation White Mother.
It is like those two games.
Have nothing at all to do with each other.
Both of them involves balls.
They share a release date well virtual pool 2 on the n64.
They're both interactive computer games released on the personal computer.
I keep re-rolling 40 gold hearthstone dailies into much harder to do 40 gold hearthstone dailies.
I'm earning about one wing of Blackrock a week though so that's good.
I hope some more of the cards become magically playable.
This hots caster continually using the word clutch as an adjective is getting on my nerves.
Are you watching the all star stuff.
That is a bunch of commentators.
Rather than good players.
Yeah that's the one.
I'd guessed if one of the teams was Jesse Cox that it wasn't entirely srs.
Essentially I'm just mad at the use of terminology.
Not entirely sure why you'd name your team after either a prison in upstate NY or a japanese fusion restaurant chain.
But it's the most perfect example of the ridiculous cult of personality infesting the industry I can't resist.
Hmm watching a chain of these matches would be more interesting if each draft caused a depletion of the hero from selection for the next round.
The caster's left his skype on so I'm hearing his notifications on the stream.
Making me double take as I'm not logged in on mine.
<- nigerian goverment 4 soldiers.
Noelor it is about time.
Windows 10 broke battle.net.
That or battle.net broke itself.
Also hearthstone does not have a login option inside of its own executable.
So i can't play HS without starting it from battle.net.
Well thats something you dont see every day MoonWolf ranting on twitter p.
For a while now one of the people in my RPG group has been going on about wanting to play a seal man.
Cooked_Auto Beast is a horrible game for bad people.
I mean that as in people who are just Bad toxic assholes who enjoy systematically ruining the lives of others.
Recently we started a new campaign that involves exploring the tower of babel in a semi christianity inspired fantasy setting.
Alas he was denied again.
Points for originality there.
Then he posts this in the facebook group.
You know i personally wouldn't explore the tower of babel.
Meanwhile my SR DM are hunting for underground lab maps for Roll20. I am so sad there wont be a session this week.
That seems like a prime place to get lightning bolted in the face by literally god.
It is uncertain if gods exist at this point in the world.
All we know is that every culture has a myth relating to the tower and the hubris that followed.
The tower thing happened in ages long past but every culture has a similar myth relating to it.
Thunder is nice as long as its not on top of me.
At which point I will have to turn off everything.
Well seeing as its raining on me that time is probably soon.
MoonWolf why is Beast so bad?
Do you have a basic idea of what Beast is ?
All I know is its an nwod game and after I bought mummy I am very careful with what nwod things I buy.
It was that dry?
I assumed Beast is a Jekyll Hyde thing?
Okay so the basic premise of Beast The Primordial is that you are a sort of personification of a primal human fear. Fear of the dark fear of utter powerlessness Fear of endless expanses of nothingness.
Every Beast has a Hunger. And they need to Feed it. The way they do that thugh.
Is basically by doing horrible things that happen to people in real life making them feel like shit making them feel hunted alone afraid.
There's pidgeons fighting in the backyard. D.
Which i guess sure up to a point.
Like making people lose all their friends?
But unlike a game like Vampire which presents you with You need to drink blood to live. And we all know this is a bad thing.
Beast doesn't it doesn't make you walk a line it tells you right out that since you are a predator and the are the prey this is the way its supposed to work.
It doesn't make the player walk a line it eggs the player on to do horrible things.
And those horrible things are actually real life abuse things.
The beasts antagonists are Heroes.
Heroes are the bad guys because they want to kill all beasts at all costs.
One of the example BADGUYS.
Is a little girl stuck in a coma that doesn't quite know how to get out but can manifest herself enough in the weird beast dream world to beat them up.
She got into that coma because a beast tried to feed on her and she beat it the fuck up for it.
THIS IS A BADGUY.
Well if you want to play a nurse who feeds by telling all her dying patients that there is no hope and they'll die and it'll be horrible and nobody really loves them.
You can play beast.
Thats... not awesome anthema.
No you clearly don't know who you're talking to so let me clue you in. I am not in danger Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!
Are you legit shocked that an nwod game has you be a monster?
I'm annoyed that they made you play a monster and treat that as though the monster is the one in the right that the victims had it coming and that it has absolutly not intention of even trying to point out the hypocrisy.
I might read this once I finish M20.
What is the pitch for Beast supposed to be anyway?
I thought it was things that go bump in the night.
Playing someone with the soul of one of the ancient horrible monsters of myth.
Or that snake thing off Beowulf whose name also escapes me?
Nah thats a giant.
I think the snake thing is just called Dragon.
I will accept that I may have confused the snake properties with that other fight in Beowulf.
Grendel is a big humanoid thing.
Beowulf is not the easiest read ever.
Beowulf Nobody brags to have read it in the original text.
Enjoy something less controversial weird deep sea creatures.
Anathema how's the soldier-mage?
Noelor MoonWolf it may well pass by wednesday but I seem to have a pretty bad tendonitis or some such in my typing hand. Just giving advance notice.
I am so notified.
What'd you do ?
No idea. Was fine saurday night. Hurt bad sunday morning.
Possibly slept on it wrong or just slow to flare up.
Did i ever tell you about the time i woke up with reduced grip strength in my left hand and it took two months to go back to normal.
At present I can't find a position that doesn't hurt. Just one that hurts less than others xV.
At least mouse hand is fine. An some things only need mouse.
Minister did not do anything on the weekend was not feeling great.
Minister I have a rough backstory which I formulated before I read any of the book though!
MairBear Mage is mostly just talk I can roll dice if you need it?
A friend of mine popped his shoulder last week while asleep.
Why do we even.
According to him it happened because he sleeps with his arm around his pillow and has a tendency to toss and turn a bit.
I sleep with my head on my arm.
Constricting blood flow is easy for me in my sleep.
You people sleep weird.
I sleep on my back vOv.
At worst I can wake up practically screaming for a cramp in my leg.
Oh those are fun too.
The punisher is Frankenstein because his name if Frank. So witty.
No all of those have happened.
Frank actually got turned into a Frankenstein monster at one point Cap was a Werewolf and Wolverine got vamped.
No idea about thor though on the top of my head.
Looks like just a zombie to me.
He's an undead MUMMY even.
I don 't want to buy it.
Kirisu yeah but 'line of sight' I meant like within 25 meters I will read more of the magic system tomorrow Dark Heresy tonight.
Just laying it all out because well.
I have to submit my 1/2-yearly development review and bits of it are in the third person.
And I don't know who's going to read it and blugh.
Link a horrible person.
Hrrm trying to find maps for roll20 is kinda tricky when you dont want fantasy ones.
I just groaned very loudly from exasperation.
Because someone I actually quite like said ladies all have a biological clock that starts ticking though with a completely straight face.
I don't think he noticed >.>.
Next time try sipping tea angrily.
It wasn't on purpose!
Eh i think he deserved it.
I'm usually quite good at not reacting to stupid shit said behind me.
But that was just.
Three remasters and one sequel v.
Reading through today's log.
MoonWolf accidentally getting three of us interested in Beast and having to explain it every time amuses me.
Its BAD GAME.
It might or might not be quite good at executing its premise.
It seems like a very bad premise though yes.
Well done MoonWolf. Well. Done.
Its like if you had the show Dexter but instead of being about Dexter it was about someone who just randomly chokes kids to death during halloween for being mean to other kids about candy.
Instead of a serial killer who kills serial killers.
And then features a scene where dexter explains in detail to the camera that the kid had it coming and its not him who's the sociopath.
Besides that was already done in HtV and Slashers p.
It is possible to be a sociopath in basically all other games.
It's not expected in many others.
Or at least not the core of your reward system.
What the hell is beast.
Except in early editions of DD.
GlennCuttlefish this year's new nWoD line.
Oh nWoD. Already lost interest P.
So do we still have a date on Exalted third edition?
Unless you meant still not.
There is no date right no.
English is still my second language some mistakes are bound to creep in |.
In other news new Prequel.
Huh apparently there's gating on xp grinding in heroes.
To stop people poopsocking?
Sitting behind their pc doing nothing but that pissing in a bottle and pooping in a sock to maximize game time.
Not a literal term!
Sweet ass-fucking mother of Talos.
I don't know any literal poopsocking.
Pissing in bottles though.
Well technically it's only gated on the comp-stomping mode 'regular' play is unmetered.
Haha that face.
Just a bit of a piss take when they automatically apply a stimpack xp boost on progression so mindset is min-max while it's active.
Look Sigrid did a lot to show me and the others in town that magic wasn’t all bad but frankly mages are weird. Every single one of them. truth.
Vi Hart just uploaded a video titles On Gender.
That video was amusing.
MoonWolf what do we think.
ChaosSmurf i'm hoping either tournaments of custom games.
I'm not sure which is more likely.
How do you mean custom.
Like with lobbies and stuff.
I mean like set up a game between friends and set your own deck rules or maybe use decks played by bosses you've beaten.
If its realy lame its actually just the cosmetics menu.
I mean they need a proper cosmetics menu.
But i don't want it to be that.
Becuase its not exciting.
I think they're not dumb enough to tease this that way.
Print all the WoW raids.
With whatever modifcations to rules you need.
I will pay legit Â£30 a pop.
You mean the wow tcg ones ?
I'd love 2v2 mode.
I can beat up people with mair.
Instead of have mair watch me beat people up.
Me + game competence.
You could play warrior i could play priest.
Our matches would NEVER END.
Also a fun idea that 1v1v1v1 thing MTG does.
Like without the weird additional deck rules.
The Great Commandy One.
I could actually XCOM with just one hand o.
<- also this just came out.
MairBear except when you need to throw a grenade and the cursor overlaps with the info boxes and you need to press a number key to throw it.
Either day-and-date with XCOM 2â€™s November launch or soon thereafter Firaxis intends to release a full suite of modding tools â€“ an Unreal Development Kit UDK and the editor the developers use to create content â€“ that will enable modders to run wild with XCOM 2. â€œIt's yours now do with it what you want.â€.
Did not expect THAT.
Letting people just unleash UDK on it proper means we can change so many fucking things.
Because we just get straight access to unrealscript.
Also that means proper custom models.
Nudemods will be... a thing.
We could import any aliens missing from EW/EU.
And MECs if they don't end up being in the game.
The EW/EU assets are already unreal assets.
And Nigel Thornberry mods.
It'd be so easy.
Okay IGN Long War does not double the amount of classes.
It actually quadrupals.
I'm not sure thats how you spell that word.
8 classes 8 MEC versions of those classes.
The MEC versions have completly different perk trees.
Because they are MECs and they need MEC weapon related perks.
Im pretty sure people would've figured out nude mods anyway.
You could literally make an Enemy Unknown map.â€ <- rebuild the farm.
Because of French basically.
Words like that end with -le.
So I believe I just encountered a mummy in a suit who talks with a british accent D.
Noelor didn't see that coming from vihart.
Is Long War worth playing.
Does it improve the maps.
I always burn out on EW.
Then you don't want to play long war.
I don't know why I burn out.
I think maybe I'm not patient enough.
It makes more maps available for more mission types but its called long war for a reason.
You'll see all of them.
Watching Game of Thrones.
Because its fucking LONG.
Knowledge of Fire Emblem feeling applicable.
There is a sword man vs a spear man.
Well spear man obviously wins.
That is how FE goes yes.
I hope whatever they do to maps and movement and cover and stuff makes xcom 2 more.
Noelor I liked the bit where the guy with the broadsword just fucking killed a dude.
Anyway then drama happened because GoT.
The faster man always wins *head on ground*.
This describes like half the GoT episodes ChaosSmurf.
MoonWolf all of the episodes with broadswords in them.
Operation Fuck It I'll Do It Myself.
Now that is an operation name.
Yeah but its also cheating since its from the XCOM LP.
Guess i'll have to pause Operation Piston Driven Healbot for a moment.
That s ure was a 22 damage rift.
I have succesfully finished this 13 times sheesh apostate.
MoonWolf if my officers die can I reassign ?
Or if you fire them.
F/SN UBW is a perfect antidote for GoT.
When I'm down I can wander over and watch Lancer getting impaled and all is well.
MoonWolf lost my shiv on exalt mission.
Despite it being in the extraction zone.
Mair deploying my first MEC with a punchfist.
On Operation Pink Elerium.
Operation Splendiferous Mahna Mahna.
MoonWolf I gladly await a 40k xcom2 mod.
You coul djus tplay space hulk.
Ah yes Mu's a tree.
The password I put an apostrophe in so I'd remember it just out if how obnoxious it is.
Full story the rule for one of my passwords is rpg characters and I'd run out of iterations for the other two I have active atm.
Two characters is not long enough for a password though!
Meanwhile on the Onyx Path blog Beast criticisms are being considered but also have you really read the book *properly*?
Actually tbh Rich is pretty cool about it.
I don't understand why people are not excited about playing a sadistic monster who feeds on the suffering of others.
Because it's not escapism Anathema.
I get enough of it irl.
You're a sadistic monster IRL?
I totally feed on the suffering of others though.
Inherent to being English tbh.
Man there are so many games I wanna play ._.
Tell me about it.
Costume Fairy Adventures is fantastic.
Goblin Quest seems pretty great.
We still haven't done anything powered by the Apocalypse.
Gumshoe needs sooooo much prep though.
Or instead of gumshoe just play any system with bits that revolve around investigation but make *finding* the clues automatic for people with the relevant skills.
That is what I'm doing in Dark Heresy for example.
That is the main take away from Gumshoe yeah.
I still wanna try Mutant City Blues though.
Steam wants me to play wakfu.
Ruined some perfectly nice ice.
The second is clean anything else.
Proving once again that the stupid hood thing never blends in.
What guy with a hood? I only see a bunch of maids.
Just a non-threatening crowd of maids.
I couldn't be less worried.
I'm a little worried.
Unrelated I think at some point my employer dropped the pun name of their lgbt committee.
Which is a shame.
Sounds like an improvement to me.
Such a fun hater.
The company is Balfour Beatty.
And for a while there was a section on the intranet titled LGBeatty.
And it amused me when I wasn't annoyed at missing letters.
Friday night I play a three-player game in somebody's reflavor hack of Apocalypse World 0xCRUNCH where weird is just wired spelled weird. v.
I accidentally sent Â£3million out of the bank early.
That is not a small number.
At least two people did stuff wrong for it to get to a point where I could even do that.
I do not have any good angry music on this phone.
So I'm listening to I'll Make a Man Out of You instead because despite the gendrism never fails to improve my mood.
If you want angry music I can make a few suggestions.
I have plenty at home.
Just not on here.
And tbh it's probably better fir me not to encourage negative emotions =P.
Anger doesn't have to be negative D.
I should try to learn this in Chinese.
Get the Jackie Chan version.
Minister you gonna be about tonight? like after 8.
Anathema soz tonight's board games night at my flgs.
So I'll not be back until 10 at the earliest probs nearer 11.
At least its not a fruit.
You're not a fruit.
Reading an article about my employers' lgbt support thing that no longer has the pun name.
Statistics state that 1.5% of people identify as lesbian gay or bisexual with less than 1% identifying as transgender.
That feels like an unnecessary distinction >.<.
Also the numbers seem off but I'm willing to accept that my environment warps my perception.
If you go by my enviroment over 10 percent of the online community is queer in some fashion.
If I could be bothered to find it.
There's an El Goonish Shive strip about that.
Shive has like 2 cis straight people that are part of the main cast at this point.
Who are you counting that isn't Sarah?
Yeah ok I think of him as a side character.
Yeah I'm pretty sure 1.5% if way too low.
Anathema identify as and UK statistics.
So there may be surveying bias idk.
<- a good thread.
Minister ah good point.
Other side of the lgbtq* thing listened to 6FU play a premade adventure in Costume Fairy Adventures.
The premade adventure contains more queer people than straight.
The players set up a lesbian pairing a lesbian triad and treated all the straight dudes as bad guys.
I bet Hitler and Stalin were straight white dudes.
Minister yeah thats just dumb.
They certainly identified as such.
You're a straight white dude.
MoonWolf I mean I love it but.
It feels a little silly.
I need to up my patron contribution for another month get MÃ¹ to cameo again.
There was a cameo ?
Minister May be something you'd like I dunno.
Because Patreon I got to submit a character of my own to cameo in their 13th Age game.
So I submitted MÃ¹ renamed Woody to better suit their setting.
And they made them a tree Woody Allen.
Which was still funny.
But not exactly MÃ¹-ish.
Not so much no.
Though I wasn't in any way expecting my MÃ¹.
To come out of Ironicus' brain.
But hey a free game is a free game vOv.
That the samurai fantasy RTS from the early 00s?
Yes that is super helpful while I'm at work =P.
It looks like it. I have no damn clue anyway.
BR was an absolute beast back in teh day.
Is it the game I'm thinking of Dob+.
With the samurais and the magic and probably chi?
I believe I gave you a spare copy I had from getting its expansion.
Yeah that sounds right.
That game was indeed a blast.
I should get it if it's free.
You have until the 11th.
Or I can just give you the installer once I get it added to my library.
Since its GoG after all.
MoonWolf I should be fine for games this week just gonna talk more than type. However it's a friend's wedding next wednesday 17th.
<- yay ranger.
Reaper SWORD IN THE ZONE.
Sniper ITZ eat shiiiiit.
In The Sword Zone.
I shoulod set Rules Of as an operation name.
Let me go do that.
MoonWolf so in HS my opponent played Ysera.
Only saw 3 cards they were all nightmare.
Grom + 3 nightmares + inner rage is not a nice thing.
MairBear in aobut 50 minutes beagle is going to do a special thing for america on stream.
MoonWolf FLASBANGS WORK ON ALL MECHANICALS RIGHT?
NO THEY DO NOT.
Ack. Caps sorry >.<.
Welp hi there cyberdiscs then <.
I'm not sure if you care.
But i'm going to sit in mumble.
Anathema I'm back but you're probably in bed.
No that's who you thank if you can't get to sleep.
Goddamn it. I almost want both of them.
Today's Stand Still Stay Silent is certainly... ideal bedtime reading.
And today's Poppy is... frankly ridiculous.
Par on course I imagine.
Noelor is SSSS ever bedtime reading.
It's not always *that*.
I read that knowing that at any moments there might be something made out of nothing but disgusting things.
Man this solo episode of XCOM though.
Featuring a heavy dose of fix your game Jake.
ANd by the end of the year We'll have Fix your game Jake 2 Electric Boogaloo.
Best XCOM picture finally got an update.
Well clearly its predecessor is the best one. Well was I guess.
People are still considering The Last Guardian?
As a going concern?
It'll come out eventually.
On the playstation 17.
...how one do make ubuntu identify the monitor so that I can have more pixels?
Well rumors say this is the year that it'll show up. Again.
Rumors say that every year.
Kaunmoth I do not bunt u soz.
Hm appears I'll be stuck with a resolution from 2003 for a while then.
Kaunmoth it should do it automagically.
Clearly the magic is lacking.
Anathema the magic is willing but the hardware is lacking.
Make sure you are using actual gpu drivers and not mesa.
The most jojo of poses.
I suggest that instead of Beast.
Onyx path make Fabulous The Posing.
A must for all bookshelves.
I need to get a display case for my warhammer.
Get one of the IKEA glass ones.
One of those to the left. They tend to be recommended for that purpose.
They're practically a standard acquisition for Warhammer people as far as Im aware.
And they work really well for Lego too.
You mean to the right?
Mindfart as per usual.
Most of my stuff is in a KR case nowadays.
I shall look into it.
What does detolf mean?
Isn't Detolf a brand of household cleaner.
If my aunt comes down this weekend I might ask her since she works at IKEA. Maybe she knows the arcane secrets of the name p.
Answer is most likely that she has no clue.
Well I woke up around 7pm and all of my tables are full of empty beer bottles and cans. Seems like yesterdays gaming session was a success.
We started playing tekken tag team 2.
Didn't really like it until we found the mode where all 3 of us could play in the same round.
And then somehow the worst player became a beast with bob.
Who has played FF 14.
Somebody's maybe going to make me play FF14 and write about it positively.
Mair and Glenn afaik.
Enjoying it so far after 2 months.
Even if I havent played for a week or two because of the time vampire that is witcher.
Mechanics wise its mostly basic mumorpeger stuff with some added flavor. Music is great graphics are pretty enough even on lowish settings and the quests vary from same old fetch quests to amazing stuff like the hilibrand line.
Just hoping it runs alright.
I HAVE SO MANY ZOMBIES.
Whats your setup like CS? My second hand computer runs it mostly at 60fps with some drops in the largest hubs.
GlennCuddlefish it's Noelor's old PC.
So it's a 2010 A+?
Should be fine I think.
The odds are clearly in your favour.
ChaosSmurf I liked FF 14.
Like my current computer is AMD phenom 2 quad core at 3.4Ghz 6 gigs of ram and some old geforce card that is probably outclassed by the cheapest current gen geforce.
Anathema you like a lot of things.
GlennCuddlefish that sounds identical to this.
I am surprised you are bothering to play The Witcher on it though.
Between teh controls and the low fps I really didn't want to play it on here.
I have no framerate issues so far.
But this is the first one I am playing.
And seeing how long this game is taking by the time I actually finish this play through the second and finally reach witcher 3 the hardware should be dirt cheap.
It's a weekly/monthly lol so randumb mopde.
How deep are you? I think I quit after chapter 2 this time.
Tavern Brawl is unlocked once a player has a level 20 Hero. <- that'll be SO HARD.
Wish it was tournament mode.
ChaosSmurf i like it.
I think they're realising they need to distribute packs better.
Or people will fall super far behind.
Every expansion makes it harder for new players to get up to parity.
I dunno how they do it without incinerating cash.
But I expect the guys who come home and play an arena everyday will keep them afloat.
Well look at it this way.
A player that quits because they don't care for the massive upfront investment.
Will never make them money.
So its more profitable to get that player to maybe pay for a few things here and there.
Than it is to just not have them.
Also card backs per deck.
Naxx will be free to everyone when the next thing comes out.
Or after the next thing.
<- so this is probably that other windrunner chick.
I assume it is lady night elf hunter.
<- and feather pauldrons make me think this is medivh.
I had that one on priest for some reason.
One thing for naxx to be free access another thing when anub'rekhan actually goes down s.
ChaosSmurf did I already ask you if you were free Friday evening?
Eating seeds with a fork is hard.
Anathema I think you asked me a couple of weeks back but we never had a conversation about it.
And probably what's going on.
I'll be in glesga.
Do you promise to not refer to it as glesga.
Also on Sunday 21st and maybe Sat 20th too.
I assume glasvegas is also banned.
Even I can agree thats a bit too much.
Glasvegas I don't mind so much.
Sat Sun is probably better for me.
I will have just moved but I might not be quite so monumentally busy.
Let me know on Friday.
What the deal is.
And I'll work stuff out.
MoonWolf implication at the moment is you can just keep doing Tavern Brawl for packs.
But maybe I've missed something.
Seems very free if so.
ChaosSmurf i think it won't be a infinite pack mine.
Glasvegas depends on how many casinos and cirque de soleil performances you have.
ChaosSmurf if i had to guess.
One pack per brawl for a random match.
One for brawling with a friend.
You know what they should do.
When you buy an adventure you get x packs.
Since the development cost of packs is now something like minus several hundred thousand dollars.
I hope they keep the previus brawls available.
Nah that isn't the normal.
MTGO and League both have rotating randumb modes.
To keep people coming back.
Cause if they're just constantly available it splits the queue times.
But in HS if you divorce those old brawls from the reward structure.
I don't think that will be a big issue.
But you could not and then you get to recatch people who played it the first time around.
By going WHOA GUESS WHAT'S BACK.
IT'S COOL MODE YOU LIKED.
And they'll be like AW MAN I LOVED COOL MODE.
Yeah but i want them to be around so it can be used in tournaments and shit.
I'M GONNA PLAY SOME HEARTHSTONE and then they give you Â£1.50 for a draft and you're in the $.
Oh I'd like the around too.
I just don't think they will be because $$$$$$$.
I hope you're looking forward to paying Â£100 for a playable version of Fallout 4.
Don't care about fallout 4 much.
Never finished 3 never played NV.
Probably won't play 4.
I thought you were all in on BethesdaGames.
Do you just like the world of Elder Scrolls then.
I have a gay friend who knitts custom jock straps and cock rings. It's kind of sweet. It kinda is in a weird way.
Paid mods are a deal breaker with games like FONV or skyrim/oblivion tbh.
Bethesda aren't using it as an excuse to keep releasing shite.
The bug fix stuff is free.
The margins are stupid.
I really doubt they'd be dumb enough to monetize patches.
But people are going to use it in a dumb way.
Cooked_Auto I mean like.
The Oblivion mod that got updated 3 years after it came out that actually fixed all the bugs instead of just critical ones.
I wont support it even under those conditions.
Made by the community.
ChaosSmurf also profit motif has major impact on communities and cooperation.
Well yes but you're a filthy communist GlennCuddlefish.
MoonWolf yeah I don't know if I support it in actual practice.
But because of how stupid people are rather than because it's a good idea.
Capitalist pigdog you will be the first agains the wall when the glorious revolution comes.
Whatever way that makes sense.
Glenn I didn't know the revolution suddenly inclded games journalism v.
No but seriously say you start monetizing mods for games like gamebryo.
The consumer will be the one to lose because you have no guarantee 1 the mod works with your setup 2 The mod wont break something else.
GlennCuddlefish that's the fault of the people who make it not being adequate professionals to charge for their product.
And is also true of all video games.
Rather than a problem of the system.
I think too much of that is inevitable for the system to be right tho.
Shitting fuck the balls on that diver.
Eh I don't think great whites are that great at snapping sideways so he's not that much in a risk.
Where I would be like.
FUCKING FUCK FUCK SHARK FUCK SHIT FUCKING SHARK WHY AM I IN THE SEA.
I imagine you'll feel your balls shrink at this then.
ChaosSmurf sure but the great white is like don't knwo what that thing is isn't food isn't hurting me guess its okay then.
Yeah sharks are pretty chill.
Is it bleeding? no? alright we can be friends.
ChaosSmurf so your solution would be to only allow adequate professionals to create mods? Or are you just not seeing the problem here?
I'll be over here killing all of these things because I am a giant spaceship beast from the nightmare depths of hell.
GlennCuddlefish paid ones yeah.
You know like how nobody buys or plays games made by shit game developers and when they do they complain about it for a bit and then stop?
You forget that Gamebryo modding has some gigantic ego issues so pretty everyone would call themselves adequate professionals.
The problem is with the people.
Not with the system in a vacuum of human beings behaving rationally.
That the system does not prepare for reality is a problem that means it maybe probably shouldn't be implemented.
So we in fact agree that as it is paid mods are a bad idea?
Oh no I am starting to feel the hangover again.
But I think it is inevitable.
It was gone for some hours.
Whereas I'm not sure you do.
The reover is the worst.
ChaosSmurf if your system assumed humanity is a bunch of rational actors by default it is a fundamentally bad system.
Just kill off humanity.
No I am sure at some point paid mods will be a thing because got to get those free funbucks.
It is odd that all of Valve's systems pretty much work like that.
But I dont like it.
And then people blame Valve when people act like total cunts.
And I'm just like well it's not really their fault is it.
People act like cunts.
If you system does not account for that.
I think its more people are upset over their favorite vendor being shady as fuck all of the sudden.
IT IS A BAD SYSTEM.
You're writing it for peple.
But you shouldn't have to account for people being fucking awful.
Because those people should be the ones getting blamed.
Rather than a system with a number of positive outcomes being removed.
ChaosSmurf thats a bit like saying laws shouldn't account for criminals.
Because thats just the fault of those criminals.
It's not really at all like that though is it.
Laws shouldn't account for scumbag lawyers would be closer.
Why would anyone violate the law though.
If we all follow it as intended.
Nothing bad will happen to anyone.
If it's a good system yes.
Law is a bit more complex than maybe people who make widely used digital products should benefit from that though.
Because there is actually a h ope in hell that people can act rationally when people is 'only' the hoever many thousands are involved in the modding scene.
Fuck no there isn't.
Despite all the actual problems.
That hope broke down 2 hours after paid mods arrived ChaosSmurf.
The loudest people complaining about mods were still the people saying developers were greedy.
And somehow taking the moral high ground when they were the ones refusing to pay for hundreds of manhours.
When they likely wouldn't accept standing in a fucking coffee line for more than 10 minutes.
They are greedy if you're helping the modders means we take th biggest cut.
Mod developers I mean.
I agree that Bethesda's cut was ludicrous.
And think all Valve's cuts are pretty ludicrous as well.
Wait who waits in line for coffee.
A games journo on my feed is talking about getting in contact with a porn star.
A comment first hands on?
People who go to places that are not the coffee machine for coffee.
Because apparantly you go to shops for coffee now.
Nb I do get irrationally angry about people doing things for free.
But if I want coffee I'll brew it myself.
Because of my job future prospects the way the world works the way I see the world should work and a lovely video of Harlen Ellison I watched once.
Wait..what day is it.
Wow you can't pause the FF14 download.
GlennCuddlefish the day we play rpgs.
Well that does explain the unusually persistent hangover.
Another Overwatch vid.
Guess it's Blizzard day.
Watching UT stream so will watch it later.
That would actually make a fine board game with minor changes.
The GM is the Shia Master.
Passing that game onto a friend who has used the video as a pepp thing for his theater group.
I found it via.
That being a podcast I am subscribed to.
Best part of this video tbh Fuck you! Fuck that guy! Fuck this door! I am outta here.
Oh crap its that late.
Have to do the dishes hopefully I will be done in 25 minutes.
That would imply we actually start on time though and since when have we ever done that?
Usually we're pretty good.
I'm just about to go peel the plastic off my eyes so I should be back in time.
Normally dressed Sadida.
At least more clothed than your average one.
I mean we can use that for your pog if you want!
But we don't use pogs.
Are you an adult when your birthday present consists of a cast iron griddle a bike and a rare first edition sugarbeet rum?
If so then I'm returning the bike.
I guess. I didn't get anything on my birthday this year vOv.
I'll buy you lunch or something in stockholm Cooked_Auto.
Haha no need. Btw any updates from her btw? My mom keeps asking about it for some reason.
Or I could bring you some beer from the island.
Maybe. Pity I cant bring any beer from local microbrewery as easily.
Ermargerds a new Laundry Files supplement.
A new mini-game for playing high-level meetings.
I spoke to her today they're flying to and from stockholm she's booking accomodations now and they'll be scaring the locals and shagging sheep for about 6-7 days I haven't got a definitive date as liam says wednesday in two weeks and she hasn't said anything.
I'll attempt another stab but she's currently annoyed at me for spamming her with bike and telling her that segway races are bad ideas.
Kaunmoth Because this beer is pretty amazing.
Ah the one I insist is really a wheat wine?
Here's the whole selection but its mostly light beers.
Well lagers which I generally dont like.
Still just give me how long they're staying in Stockholm and I can work with that.
They have a few of the ones from here.
Could probably ask dad to order one of those in.
I wouldn't know which one is the good one as I don't drink beer.
The US red ale is one that the brewery recommended to my friend to sell over the summer so I guess that's good?
Dont think Ive tried that many red ales actually.
So that could be interesting.
Im gonna have to take a trip down to the store tomorrow or on friday I think as mom is hosting an end of school party for her teacher workmates which ironically includes my brother.
Man I can't wait for this model to come out for non-KS backers. Pretty sure IG commanders take actually take lightning claws as weapons but who caaaares.
Pity this one seems a bit too cleavage-y for my taste >_>.
No IG models can take lightning claws.
Vance Stubbs says otherwise >I.
One of the notes in my text file is 'traveller date map' and I have no idea what it means.
Cooked_Auto I think they'll land in stockholm on the 24th I'll continue my stabbing of kim to make sure.
And how long they plan on staying in stockholm.
Yeah that'd be nice to know as well.
Yeah I saw. Will get it at some point.
In 'My Room' you can make intimate contact by touching the character!
Oh good you can be gay.
That's not even sarcastic it's a Nintendo game.
Otoh because Fire Emblem...
We invited Sakura today! Elder brother what do you need of me? Fun skin-shipping! The face is close! close! close!
I'm sure you'll get it.
...I have no clue.
Seems mostly true for witcher 1 as well.
Seems true for the entire series.
I've lookeda t it.
And I don't know what it is.
Join a cross-realm raid for BRF about half the raid are from a single italian server after 1 boss down and 2 attempts on a 2nd several of the italians disconnect and group is called off as they fail to get back in.
6.2 couldn't come any sooner.
Looks like i was on point with my predictions of the new HS heroes its medivh and alerira windrunner.
Reddit petition Remove Ellen Pao from her job as Reddit CEO.
They won't let us harass fat people for being fat.
If you wanna be mad / sad check out r/all atm.
Ok I need to stop.
<- read this instead.
Noelor what's the timing estimate for tonight?
Noelor 90% chance Akashayana.
Body please all I wanted was to sleep.
No sleep for you.
Sony and director Paul Feig have cast Chris Hemsworth to play the receptionist in the female-driven â€œGhostbustersâ€ reboot.
What is the skill spread in M20 13/9/5 ?
Time to comfort eat.
Kult is making a return apparently.
On hold on the phone~.
Minister what is the skill spread in M20 13/9/5 ?
Top of my head yes that.
Just misread Hastings as hashtag when skimming a file.
UPDATE 1326 11/6/2015 Blizzard has confirmed that the new Heroes will be sold for either Â£6.99 if you purchase them through the in-game shop of the desktop client or Â£8.99 if you buy them via your iOS device.
So Blizzard don't make less after Apple takes their 30% cut.
That is a date not a picture title dArt.
Anyway are you linking it to me at home because it's nws?
Just thought it'd be a better idea to link it back home to you instead of your phone because of picture size and all that.
Besides if I did link it your phone you'd probably tell me to link to you at home anyway so you could save it or something P.
My 1st world-est problem right now is the limited pool of easy cosplay characters who I like and have remotely the right skin tone for.
Like even before figure height etc.
Besides don't see much use in linking anyone of you outright smut unless requested so p.
It's true I can find my own smut.
Not to mention my tastes in it != yours so its even more pointless.
Minister trufax I gym so I can cosplay Master Roshi.
It's true I don't find tanks arousing.
Har har har p.
The above is an obvious falsehood.
You are too follically challenged for Bolin.
Bolingbrook is what auto correct suggested there.
Skin tone seems about the easiest thing to fix when cosplaying.
Well there are either makeup or body socks if you wanna go into extreme shades.
Not paint though. Never go with paint unless for a small area.
GlennCuttlefish becoming Pakistani is not within the range of makeup.
Minister yeah I'd need a wig.
Also Reboot is actually getting... rebooted p.
Were we planning on starting the campaign today minister ?
Thought he said next week just to let Ana have a chance at making a character.
I just recall hearing something about next week vOv.
He might have but I have been busy.
Perfectly fine with not starting today tbh I feel like a retarded zombie.
5 hours of sleep yayy.
GlennCuttlefish it is tonight.
Next week Noelor is not free.
Despite the good weather Im going to the cinema to watch Jurassic World v.
Hahaha the skill ratings for the Research skill in M20 are all Buffy characters.
Link was speedrunning long before it was cool.
There are some pretty great rating lists.
Jetpack is another highlight iirc.
Minister I am likely to be taking Corresponance and Mind.
So a friend gifted me with a trillby.
And is trying to guilt trip me into wearing it.
Throw it in his face.
It is a nice gesture but I am not sure I can wear a hat at this point.
I still say you should Oddjob him with it for laughs.
If it was a proper wide brimmed hat I might be more inclined to wear it but to pull this one off I would have to lose some major amounts of weight.
Then again I have to do that anyway sooner or later or die of some kind of heart explosion.
Well hopefully not heart explosion. If I understood this right I kind of need my heart for stuff.
I'd like to officially say i called it on valeria windrunner.
That was sort of your prediction yes.
There is only two.
The fact i couldn't remember her name.
Is besides the point.
Well there are three.
Maybe there's a brother.
I forgot about ronins waifu.
I'd forgotten Ronin's waifu wasn't Valeria.
ChaosSmurf Pharah vid's up.
He'll have seen it before he sees that but.
Has anyone translated what Hanzo says when he uses his ulti ?
1st google result.
This Pharah is getting a lot of kills.
But she's not really HELPING.
Turns out justice is not a counter for an earlier justice.
No the video showed that quite clearly.
By the time your missile barrage gets in the air their missile barage is already impacting.
Iused to have it all then i fucked up and saved the world.
Well it does make sense.
If you played the game.
It won't be the same game without a sarcastic asshole spirit in my head.
Well thats not good.
I smell burning but I have no idea what it is.
It didnt smell like burning electronics at least.
Or it did a hour ago I guess.
I HAVE TOO MANY CARDS TO SELL.
Today has been a good day.
Good work things and I lifted more weight than I have before!
Noelor when are you aiming to start?
Noelor might be a few mins but am mostly here.
What is that picture.
Why is Jim Butcher now the author of WoD.
Why is that picture WoD.
Originally some dresden files picture.
But then internet got their hands on it.
And thats pretty damn wod.
I guess I'm trying to work out which specific sides of WoD.
Looks like changeling vampire ... hunter ?
Anathema GlennCuttlefish MairBear.
Anathema PICK AN AMERICAN NAME.
Moomin once again manages to describe my life.
Noelor Gai Kaplan one of each!
MairBear is å¤– gai?
That does not work.
This has to be my favorite twitter right after kamiyas.
Yeah they'd really apreciate it.
Man gta5 are being absolute dicks in the sale.
Base price Â£40 no sale discount applied but you can get the Â£52 version with a dlc attachment that comes with a 25% discount to make it Â£39!
Well not really a dlc it's in-game currency.
Jurassic World was actually pretty good.
Not just because of Chris Pratt.
Drat no voting badges this year.
Mairnai Operation Hot Cuppa Operation.
Bah nothing good today and you have to actually engage yourself for badges.
Humbug and so forth.
Glenn Viscera Cleanup detail is 670eu P.
But Firaxis was willing to confirm thereâ€™s at least one piece of the old XCOM thatâ€™s survived to bridge the gap between Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2 Central Officer Bradford your right-hand man from the XCOM base will be back. Woo \O/.
Episode 10 of pleiades the girl with pink hair who mahou shoujo transforms into a girl with pink hair has just realised the androgynous male with red hair and ear piercings mahou shounen transforms into an androgynous male with red hair and ear piercings.
And vice versa only just now 10 eps in after them meeting one-another both methods each week.
Sure is magical girl anime.
As expected my greatest difficulty in mage20 is the paradigm.
I'm pretty sure I wanna run/play this.
You linked that last night.
MoonWolf missed it somehow.
FF7 LP status Ruby and Emerald Weapons down.
I think this LP will finish before Ex3 comes out.
I mean I don't actually know how much game is left but the thread is talking like it's just the no-return portion of the final dungeon plus the OWA fight.
Also there is one hell of a summary of Beast in the Ex3 thread.
Huh didn't realize I had a foil card in my steam inventory.
Operation No Father xD.
I had an unfortunate activation but got 'lucky' in that my 3 guys were only critically injured and weren't my medic.
5 stalkers and 5 floaters when there were a previous 2 floaters left standing.
Don't you just love it when a pod is standing in an unactivated pod you can't see.
Fucking bullshit line of sight.
Not as fun as 5 stalkers hovering over a UFO.
And only activated when you are already INSIDE the thing.
Anyone got a kat.cr proxy.
Also they put up a Pharah video where she looked really good because nobody ever tried to kill her.
ChaosSmurf that player was being bad.
Constanly going ahead to kill reinforcement while the cart was being pushed.
While she has the best aoe damage on the team.
Dunno with that level of maneouverability sometimes it's the right play.
But yeah she's not exactly Spy.
Also neither of her ulti's did much.
In fact the second one she died becuase she tried to counter the opponent one that fired first.
Which DOES NOT WORK.
Yeah her rocket launcher does so much damage the ult just seems awful.
DEATH RAINS FROM ABOVE is a nice quote at least.
Semone was very board one year.
How drunk/tired are you right now?
Cooked_Auto what did i just watch ?
Looks like japanese festival cooking even.
Hmm almost shorts weather.
Unless you have my legs then it's never shorts weather.
So? Mine are like two hair pillars and I dont care.
Nah I just blind people with my skin.
Things that blind pilots laser pointers and me.
It has been too hot for wearing my leggings on the bike.
And it's all just hair and paleness.
I don't recommend it.
Does fix the blinding whitness though.
So kaunmoth should look into it.
My leg hair is so blonde that it's invisible.
Listen here you soulfull little shit I'll mess you up I swear on my Elder Maw.
Kaunmoth p jell tbh.
All my hair is so dark it's almost impossible to shave out of visibility.
<- look i like this comic and all but something weird is going on with the fork there.
Fix your comic Siddel.
Yeah I agree its all forked up.
Amazing didnt get ID checked while buying beer this time around.
Arse I've already forgotten what day of the week I said it was in the game last night.
Which would be the 2nd.
I started writing up the mage session.
Got as far as describing Joshua and Korrina =v.
Anathema gonna be working today lol.
ChaosSmurf nae bother always next week.
Minister it was Tuesday.
Because you said that friendly shop perosn worked Wednesday.
Yay Glenn and I were right.
I thought I said she worked Thursday but ok!
I am 99% sure you said Wednesday!
Yeah thats a low estimate.
Lego Jurassic World bought >.
Somebody was complaining about it on my feed.
I don't expect a hyper good game. Even if Lego Marvel was pretty good.
But Lego and Dinosaurs 3.
Lego marvel was yeah.
We've been playing a bit of hobbit.
Well and Lego Chris Pratt too.
All very important things.
This is very OOC.
Man vestigial nipples are the worst.
None of the feeding the young all of the sensitivity to fabric.
Anathema you run back me up here.
I don't get chaffed nipples any more.
Maybe they are calloused or something.
I think I'm just wearing a coarser shirt than usual today.
I assumed my chaffing went away since now my boobs are big enough that the shirts don't really bounce when I run.
That seems like the opposite of how boobs work.
My boobs are pretty big now man.
Well by boobs I do mean pecs so there is no jiggling.
That's a significant difference.
Yeah but its funnier when I talk about having sore boobs.
I wrote a thing about what's best about DOom.
And the editor changed the header of the bit about infighting being great from Everybody's friends on the antagonist bus.
Is it.
Sectoids have an ability which lets them disorientate or mind control a unit.
Sectoids have an ability called Psi Reanimate which lets them resurrect dead aliens or XCOM soldiers to the enemy side.
Vipers still have the Thin Man's acid spit ability.
Sectoids are now Chrysalids.
<- aaand medivh.
Called that one too.
Also where's that XCOM knowledge from.
They are still busy taking two weeks to spread information that could have been maybe 2 good articles and an interview.
Its thin on the ground on actual information on those.
Like a 1 to 3 facts per article.
The rest is just... noise.
I didn't realise it was 2 weeks.
It must work or they would have stopped though.
Less info that games companies usually give out in press releases.
Per 2k word article.
And would have made a wonderful 8 page preview in the good old days.
It was alright cause there was the reveal.
And then there was the trailer talk over thingy which was gimicky but alright.
And then there was an interview now the interview was basically all the things they already said but whatever.
Then it got dumb.
You should put that in a comment section.
I'm allergic to comment sections.
I have built up a natural resistance.
New Steam sale daaaaay.
Still can't play the game.
Lucky I can't remember my Steam password then.
Cooked_Auto it cannot have been a good idea to do that barehanded.
'sample cannot examine process 14694 VirtualBoxVM for unknown reasons even though it appears to exist' UNKNOWN REASONS.
But that is pretty damn cool anyway.
At least its honest aobut it.
Noelor thats some serious leidenfrost effect right there at the start.
The part where the droplets just sort of skitter around on the boiling hot plate.
Instead of you know.
Noelor its a cool effect.
Extra large text no long words....
Wouldn't want to be challenged while masturbating.
But the size of text is controlled by the kindle settings!
Its extra large anyway!
Man I'm !ing a lot.
Need to get that under control!
I actually know the alt code for ¿ off the top of my head.
Which is... I'm not sure why or how that happened.
I can't think of any others I know.
Were you not using that in some rpg.
I forgot the details.
Also alt-codes don't work in hexchat.
Maybe that's it yeah.
ChaosSmurf Also as a side note the VV model is not made for running. Her tits just go all over the god damn place it's ridiculous.
While talking with Isaac our companions get bored and start photobombing the LP.
Noelor is a Bloodlines LP actually occuring.
Oh is it all modded.
Because the previous normal one was finished.
Was it actually good.
Same thread as that one as a sidenote.
I mean was the finished one good.
It was pretty extensive.
Further questions did FF7 finish yet.
And should I read JadeStar/Guava's XCOM LP.
0915 FF7 LP status Ruby and Emerald Weapons down.
0916 I think this LP will finish before Ex3 comes out.
Though it is 0% narrative.
If that's what you're after it being the nature of the classic XCOM LPs.
The nature of those LPs was being fucking great.
So I'll take it.
It is a 0-death classic run with informative and/or amusing commentary.
And lots of robot punching.
Guava shouts BOOSH! literally every time a mech punches anything.
Is that less shit than it sounds.
Except for in the handful of videos he's not in.
Depends which video it is?
Some of them aren't quite synched.
Which is the worst.
This has been worth it alrready.
They're not going to do long war on account of it'd take them literally years.
Yeah that sucks but w/e.
I should probably watch a Long War playthrough at some point.
Bratterz said he was gonna make a video about it some time I was holding out for that.
There is one ongoing on SA if you're interested.
I am actually surprised these guys like Enemy Unknown/Within.
But a lot of people who loved the originals seem to be way more up on it than I am.
23 pages so far.
Here's a more storybased XCOM LP.
TIL the silver age Barry Allen Flash called himself that because of having read the golden age Flash comics.
Is reminding me of so many things I hope they fix in XCOM 2.
There are so many Bethesdabugs in this game that improving all of them would make the game 10-20% better.
Maybe Jake will finally fix his game.
I assume it was a $$$ issue.
ChaosSmurf and the golden age Flash is whose helmet showed up at the end of the CW Flash series.
They don't have platform owner money this time either.
Noelor I LOVE UNEXPLAINED THINGS.
I am listening to some friends from my flgs discuss all the crazy bullshit.
Computer detects second monitor second monitor is misconfigured since before and only recognizes scart input universal remote unable to access menu to accept PC input.. yays.
ChaosSmurf so many line of sight/pathing bullshit bugs.
They are by far the most frustrating.
MoonWolf exactly what I was thinking of yeah.
I think they're engine issues though so I'm pretty worried they won't be.
They datamind the new HS patch.
Its worth looking at the mined brawl stuff.
Its ofcourse just random stuff they found.
But there is some neat idaes in there.
Some of them are clearly bullshit.
Or people just having fun with their card creator.
And some of them are just the credits cards.
I assume they added team members.
And are including them now.
Living Bomb suggests one of the modes is play as a boss.
Having looked at all of them.
A new hero is rag and a new weapon is sulfuras.
Yeah I just read further.
There might be a play as rag brawl.
I wonder if you play as Nef vs. Rag.
And Rag vs. Nef.
Is that one of the staff.
Though its one of the few credits cards that would actually WORK.
2/2 for 2 meaningless special effect.
Most of them actually could work.
This could be one of the decks.
If they make a deck for credit cards.
I'll be right in there.
Thats like playing a game of unhinged/unglued in magic.
Okay they got a lot less meaningful as I went.
And even less so than Unhinged which does function as a game.
It's also shit however.
These rag cards are sweet as fuck.
I'd play some rag vs nef.
Oh my god so much shooting through walls as well.
ChaosSmurf Pip's latest article on RPS.
JadeStar gets so lucky at the start of this jesus christ.
I remember her talking about it but.
I didn't think she was going whole hog.
Oh its out in August. Sweet.
Meanwhile things keep happening in the worst fanservice of season.
2 episodes to go and still some unexplained mysteries. Like how did it all start and why is that fax machine in the fridge.
Obviously someone doesnt want it to fall victim for too many hot news.
I thought Uncle was the organisation not the protag...
Also and Hugh Grant.
Which faxservice is this?

Good lord those eyes.
Self published erotica is getting too damn meta for my tastes.
Man witcher 2 really makes you work for your kills.
OPERATION THE INCREDIBLE SODIUM.
How the fuck is Heroes of Newerth at 5k viewers on twitch.
One of the bigger dreamhack events.
Nothing else on Sat-Tues this week right.
Not that i know of.
Just didn't think the did a HoN thing.
Is liquidhearth just advertising dreamhack because it's a big deal.
Or are they also doing HS?
I think CSGO is the only thing there that's relevant.
Everything else seemed to have noobies.
Anyway the joke was E3 MoonWolf.
Yeah but thats not the same sort of thing.
I know e-sports tournaments don't give a flying fuck about press coverage but I assume they care about stream viewership.
Wait shit E3's this weekend?
Week? I know oculus did something earlier this week.
Any big stuff yet?
Nah it isn't on properly until Sunday night here.
Something tells me I might miss bethesda.
But who cares about bethesda.
Monitor's on its last legs by the looks of things.
This dude that replaces guava for one episode sure is almost completely unbarable.
Skippy? I guess he's a bit of an acquired taste when it comes to commentators.
He's just a bit.
No love for skippy.
I also enjoy skippy commentary.
I have a Dawn of War {sequel x} LP on as background noise.
Oh no noise marines! They're making me feel sexy! Such a sexy ork!
That's how Noise Marines work MoonWolf.
Yeah but i thought nooise marines were all about the music indulgence.
Not the sex bit.
Needs to read Fulgrim.
But its not me.
Pretty sure it's ChaosSmurf.
He probably hasn't read it this month yet.
Yo I've only read that book twice.
And the second time it wasn't as good but the noise marine bit was just as good.
This map has the Khorne symbol upside down.
Which was a poor design decision because that's the one that looks like a happy stick figure.
Is it Dark Conflict.
I had to check the video title.
... oh that's DoW 2.
That is what it says yeah.
The numbers feel a bit meaningless to me with DoWs though.
DoW 2 is a completely different game.
And very close to not being an RTS.
In fact I would probably call it RTT and then have an argument about strategy vs. tactics.
Well this iteration of it has an ork in a pirate hat.
Problem with playing the Lego games and not having a gamepad means that your fingers hurt after a while.
I am really looking forward to the sense of discovery in XCOM 2.
I hope they manage to replicate that despite the systemtic changes.
The HS stream for dreamhack has did you know factoid stream overlays now.
Man DoW2's minimap seems kinda rubbish.
Hmm just cleared out probably about 3 yrs worth of sporadic card-holder receipts and withdrawal statements from my wallet.
It now goes flat which has amazed me.
Fortunately I have a 4/8 month system for that.
I just stuff my pockets with the receipts and then throw them away every time I switch back to that particular coat after summer/winter.
Hm the measuring device of heat and lack of claims it's 31 degrees outside.
It must be wrong.
Dob you are bad at wallet.
Anything less than 10p just goes into a jar.
The coin purse clasp on my wallet bust years ago.
A colleague of mine has just a purse with card slots on the outside.
Noelor my little brother has a cellphone cover with a card holder.
Yeah they're pretty common here.
I'm not a fan.
Was considering getting one of those since I barely have any cards aside from MC and ID.
Nor do I really go around with cash money as well so.
Only this year did Britain start having more card transations than cash.
So the current rumour is that the next Platinum game is apparently a G1 the original series Transformers game.
Rules of... robots ?
I see they decided to take thateve rthey were using for korra shading and take it a chromy step further.
Which is why people suspect its the new Platinum game.
Oh yeah it's Royal Wedding time today. Our prince is getting married.
Yay for him =>.
Partners in Time may be the worst Mario Luigi but this remix is pretty great.
Jesus christ witcher 2 bosses do not fuck around.
I wouldn't expect them too.
Which would be fine if the combat in this game was fun.
Unfortunately as it is now my only way of beating this boss seems to be around 3 thousand fast hits and force push spam.
Oh and the boss also has a shield that lasts for 30-60 seconds that absorbs all damage.
Avoiding him while it is on is trivial but dull as hell.
That is a little bad.
I've managed to get into the hardcore grinders room on the Steam minigame.
We're on level 210.
It came up about 5 minutes ago.
Levels take roughly 2.
My game managed to get to lvl 990.
Blast my first card dupe.
I think i was on 1100 at the end of the last one.
I assume this will hit 3k+ like it did yesterday.
I guess I should join more games since that is what is giving me cards atm.
Well aside from some purchases.
Pretty sure if I sell the foil I've got I can finance a whole bunch of card purchases to complete other badges.
Amusingly enough Smurf has all the cards I need except two v.
Lol 99 badge points.
I just keep it running on the steam client. Dont really see a point in doing much else.
It's a bit shit though.
I just drop all my dosh into the automated stuff. cba to actually engage with it =p.
But a nice distraction from the abyss.
As I put it in my post today.
Right but even so.
And now it's an exercise in seeing how badly it can be broken by organisation and scripting.
It didn't deal well with that.
It has an in-built thing that more than 20 clicks a second are pointless.
Is the current rumour anyway.
4chan's beating reddit.
Shit is dying hilariously fast right now.
We're up to thousands of trillions of health bosses which take a while to grind through.
Only on lvl 277 but each level time is like 5 to 10 seconds each.
So now its up to lvl 282.
Yeah mine's up to about 5 seconds each now.
Though seems to depend some still take only 2 seconds.
Things die as soon as they spawn in here occasionally.
Currently critting for 8 million.
Sadly I only do 8k damage a tick.
The delay is hilarious because it feels like it skips levels just because how fast it is.
209m DPS in my lane.
Somewhere around 1500 here.
For a second we had 85B dps.
New deals up eh.
ChaosSmurf so if you don't care about trying hard.
Is there any reason to get anything but armor and autofire stuff ?
Looks like pick one or two elements and line yourself up in the right lane when you level up.
But otherwise I don't think so.
And honestly even armour seemed a bit pointless.
Father's day is next week.
Any of you guys on OSX?
MoonWolf not unless you're using an auto-clicker.
Wtf are you guys talking about?
Also I have an OSX machine.
But it's not on.
Operation Dystopian Dragon Dildo.
I kinda want Dystopian Dragon to be the verb.
Watching Jade Star try to navigate the battleship map.
It's pretty amazing this stuff is still in the game tbbbhhh.
Man the general is such a badass.
I hadn't seen some of these Enemy Within cutscenes before.
Thats what in Long War after you finish that mission.
You get him as a soldier.
He gets autonicknamed The General.
This was made by one of the ultimate polish companies.
This game would be so good with that last 5-10 percent.
Its good to remember.
This game was made.
On a budget for aaa titles.
And came out for a lower tier price too.
That should have polish.
I actually want XCOM 2 to be multiplatform Â£50 on release.
But don't think it will be they seem to be serious about that no-console deal.
I think its just a money thing.
They didn't make enough sales on console.
Beyond Earth wasn't too polished either though.
We'll see maybe once people who aren't IGN get their hands on coverage they can ask important questions like what are you going to fix all these insane flaws.
Ign isn't going to burn all that profit and exclusivity on annoying things like questions that are not in the pr script.
The unrenting positivity of it is so early 00s mag.
I should screepcap one of their articles and just black out anything that isn't new information.
They don't even write good fluff.
Is what really annoys me.
Like I have written a lot of fucking clickbait recently.
And fluffing it out is the only thing fun about it.
They could have had any insight or look back to previous xcom games at all.
But they did not.
Even the obvious things like this perk is that like that other perk but for swords.
Ah do they have details now?
Have they shown any in-ganme yet in fact.
Ingame happens on the 14th at e3.
Ion Hazzikostas is doing his dev qa atm in case anyone's interested.
I am interested but will watch/read the archive.
MoonWolf what about the plot stuff.
Or have they admitted that their dystopian future doesn't make sense with the plan that was outlined in XCOM 1.
Not a yip on the plot besides the xcom lost bit.
And it does work with the plot of the previous game.
If during their loosing xcom managed to field some impressive psi.
They'd be interested in taking over.
And kidnapping all the impressive psi talents.
Wouldn't they have destroyed most of the world's cities.
And turned half the populace into zombies.
The only big cities in xcom 2 are advent cities.
And aren't everyone but the ethereals actually good guys.
Or at the very least have very little interest in earth.
So either you accept advent into your life and live a normal place and have a job.
Or you live in bombed out cities or slums.
Everyone but the ethereals are either directly controlled by them or their higher ups are.
You agree on these 6th squad member is an alien things?
I don't think that will be the case but i'd love it if it was.
I think its more likely that the unrevealed class is going to be related to a mechanic they did not want to reveal yet.
Much like how the specialist is a hacking class.
Or the ranger is a stealthy class.
Today's hots daily play 8 games.
You don't have to do it today.
Watching this LP has made me wish it was going to be Apocalypse 2.
With all the best bits of both.
And buildings that actually collapse.
Apprantly buildings are much more destructable in 2.
Have they confirmed it's a different engine?
Cause I desperately want it to be a different engine.
Its unreal engine 3 with their own enhancements.
Which is why they did nto upgrade to 4.
Otherwise we know shit all about it.
Half the world is unreal engine.
Just because its unreal 3 doesn't mean they can't have changed their geometry problems.
That's why it's even more embarassing how bad the engine problems were in this game V.
Yeah hopefully they spent some time on it.
If they've been making it since Unknown like was implied then I'm hopeful.
Fix your game jake etc.
Enter a state of deep rapport smooth Rin.
I she suggesting sex ?
To power his reality marble ?
Such a crass view of things!
Light Rain my ass.
Its pissing down outside.
Holy shit that Bethesda recording.
That apparently confirmed Dishonored 2.
I dont get it. Why does capcom hate its fans.
Like they're holding their IP's hostage with the good ol' capcom test and then making dumb decisions.
Like releasing resident evil zero HD next.
Instead of say...Resident evil 2 remake which would sell like hot cakes in an antarctic fridge.
Or saying hey guys we wont make another DMC game unless 4 HD whatever edition sells enough.
And then releasing it with minimal marketing.
Digital only outside of japan.
The same days as batman.
So far I really like Rust.
Massive brawl mode spoilers tho.
Some of those don't look much like Gwent.
Cool they're putting a Tales game on PC.
Pity its the shit one.
Currently in the Watch Dogs LP assholes talking to assholes with really terrible voice acting.
Noelor which one ?
Never even heard of that one.
Its the latest one.
Dont think it has had a western release yet.

MoonWolf it's not out yet.
Fffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck I hate my DM at times.
There I was a beautiful round about to obliterate the whole encounter with my carefully setup sorcerer boost and force salvo 2 crits on the way.
Better up the ante next time.
Finished the xcom LP.
It was pretty good.
ChaosSmurf that was fast.
And a nice replacement for actually playing the game which it reminded me I would not enjoy.
I have literally had it playing 12-16 hours a day while I work for three days.
Really really can't wait to see some of XCOM 2.
And then overreact that it still has graphics and animation bugs that every game not made by Blizzard/Riot/Valve has.
Ahahaha 356 badge points.
Wtf am i even going to buy with all these points.
Are you like me do you hate e3.
I'm probably just going to watch the nerdcubed recast with him and others taking the piss out of everything.
Probably just watch one of the uncommented streams.
Mostly because I'll be busy with both twitter irc and skype chat so.
Not opening twitter in th enext three days.
Oh hey plastic memories is up to episode 11 as well..Might have to catch up and see if it turns out good in the end.
This has Ben Brode's face in it.
ChaosSmurf definitely Ben Brode's face.
MOONWOLF PUT A FUCKING HS CARD MANAGER IN.
BUT NOT ONE FOR MTG WHEN I ASKED.
THIS RELATIONSHIP IS OVER.
Noelor>> turns out it did end up getting a paintjob in the end.
My god Peter Stormare is just amazing in TSW D.
Well. My plan of sleeping a hour or two before e3 failed somewhat miserably.
!note ChaosSmurf !mtg is a thing.
And it has started my twitter has become an unreadable e3 liveblog.
MoonWolf did you know.
Grr nearest gym here were all 'we cant let you in without you doing an induction' |.
So Beth is trying to get in on that sweet Hearthstone money.
I swear ever since HS the online ccg is the new moba which in turn is the new mmo.
Anathema steal their door and start benching it outside.
Pretty sure being an asgardian counts as doping these days.
Then clearly put Steve Rogers and Lance Armstrong in the US team.
Oh yeah threw out my first summer spider last night.
Damn only need three more cards for the badge and then Im done.
Wtf is it ?
Custom winged hive tyrant.
This Malygos Warlock is a thing.
That was a match.
Hope to never find that on ladder.
Bad news. It's already on Liquidhearth's power ranking thread.
If they're gonna sponsor every HS tourney. Can they do more than the two virtually identical player interview segments? >c.
That would require effort.
Signs that your cat might be cleverer than you think and might be trying to tell you something.
Ours just brought us half a mouse.
MoonWolf lethal is hard.
Oh gods the Audiosurf 2 UI is worse than it was in the first game.
I was looking for the next button thinking it was some kind of msn-homepage hideous rubbish.
Turns out that was the main menu V.
Worst part is probably the browse music window where the actual browse window is far too small for its own good and the rest is just dominated by suggested tracks.
Not to mention that you can't apparently read the full track titles as well.
Dob is afraid that liking Taylor Swift means I'm turning into his sister.
Minister its a legitimate concern imho.
Jesus fuck that's some awful autocorrect.
MoonWolf I wish I had Dob's sister's figure tbh.
MoonWolf Oh god. I went on a boss mission In Darkest Dungeon.
Forgot to buy food.
Also unrelated going to a con at the end of the month considering cosplaying a lumberjane.
Unsure how Jane to be.
However amount you are comfortable with.
You're there to have fun not to feel like you'd rather leave.
I will probably be like.
Deniably Jane just because cosplay = photos being taken.
And photos taken = photos on Facebook.
Unless they're assholes just say no if they want to take a photo. When I went to a con and brought a camera I always asked people in costume if I could take a picture.
Also full Jane requires a wig.
Vs just going blonde again.
And going blonde again means I can follow up with brighter colour dyes!
That one specific hair colour being gendered in English is so dumb.
Unrelated Ex3 countdown now weeks-ish!
Still not keeping my hopes up.
Only 20 more weeks!
Thats a number of weeks right.
MoonWolf New item 50% damage 15% crit boost at deaths door. 12% deathblow resistance. The downsides -15% max hp and -8 dodge. Seems good.
Risky but good if you can't avoid it.
MoonWolf can confirm number status.
-health to make it even easier to trigger the death's door effect@.
Minister can't wait to play Ex3 in 2016.
!mtg Jace Architect of Thought.
Oh come on that doesn't count.
Just because MTG cards have 13 billion more lines of text.
Well thats witcher 2 done with.
Oh come on that doesn't count <- this is in fact literally what you suggested i do.
I'll dig up logs if you don't believe me.
MairBear i had to miss the match.
Who won amaz or tiddler ?
Why are there 10 fucking jace cards.
Making a new set.
We should probably print another jace planeswalker card.
He has a few named after him that are not actually him.
I think he has 5-6 cards.
None of them as good as mind sculptor.
Wasn't the first duel set Jace v Chandra?
Surprised it didn't throw up all of those.
Earlier today I paid one Frank Stuart.
Which is a pretty great name because it falls into both two first names and looks-like-a-nickname categories.
The real reason Minister has this job is so they can look at funny names.
Now I'm paying a Stan Brophy.
Which is like a trophy you get for being a bro?
Unsure on how I rate that.
Thanks news i really wanted to know realdoll was working on AI for its creepy sex things.
Well someone has to do it MoonWolf.
Minister i'm not judging your reasons.
MoonWolf I meant the AI thing.
Noelor replace this pen's ink omg.
Frequently 1 and 2 are in fact the same thing.
Its really easy to make money with porn.
The best phoenix wright cosplay.
I have Iron Maiden's Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter stuck in my head.
And am unsure why.
A sudden love for heavy metal ?
I have literally no idea what that might be.
Or just a digital comic.
Yeah digital comic mag.
MairBear the missed lethals continue.
Cooked_Auto are you literally just linking this to me because it's a queer romance thing?
Hmm Audio$urf 2 on the steam sale. Discounted price still higher than the base unadjusted price of its predecessor which is itself down 90% to 60 pence.
Minister Kinda yes >_>.
Dob I bought it it's more of the same wrapped in an atrocious UI.
Even if I found more enjoyment out of browsing skins.
Cooked_Auto while I'm not going to deny that that's an intersection of my interests stories *about* queer people shouldn't be marketed as only *for* queer people.
Just as a y'know rule of thumb.
And/or pet peeve of mine.
Noted. Just thought you'd be interested vOv.
So thanks but also like by the same logic if it has lesbians link it to MoonWolf.
I forgot that in this case p.
Also don't take too much notice of me I'm just having a shitty day.
Seems like a reoccuring theme.
Minister thats okay using irc as a complaining about work outlet is a long standing internet tradition.
PC mods can now be played on the console version of FO4.
Well this is interesting.
Verified authorized paid for mods only!
For gold platinum members.
Its like regular platinum.
Hey if you make a trailer try not to put generic trailer music on it.
Ahahaha early access for xbone.
I guess this conference didn't have enough terrible news yet.
So they had to put it in there.
They really want to cut down QA costs.
On hardware that doesn't change yays.
Well that was the least informative trailer I have ever seen.
So its the usual.
MoonWolf is this finals?
Lol Rare is making a Pirate MMO.
I am not convinced that was actually real.
Or if it was affordable.
Welp looks like Squeenix is finally that desperate.
Finally a reason to own a PS4.
HD remake of a beloved 20 year old game people have been gaggin' for a re-release of is not 'desperate'.
MairBear this final is going really fast.
Yeah but its also riding on nostalgia which is all the rage these days for a quick buck.
Yeah got distractedf by a thing whole game had gone by.
If you ever had a positive thought C_A would you jsut drop dead?
But seriously FF VII remake would make some good fanbux and its an ace up squeenixes sleeve.
Assuming it doesn't end up costing too much.
I'd imagine the pricing would be 40 bucks or something.
At least not normal console full price because its a remaster after all.
Anathema Also if you could see the bile my friends are spouting elsewhere about E3 you could just get bent.
Oh hey look another team shooter.
Did everyone secretly decided to make team based shooters for 2015/2016 or something ?
I'm more worried about Rare and the fact they're making an apparent MMO.
At least it's not zombies v.
Still undeads around though.
Pick 1 of 3 exciting zombie classes.
Slow zombie fast zombie or puke zombie.
Kaun true but its not focused around them.
Or is a post-apoc survival game with Zombies.
<- stuff about divinity original sin.
Zombie MMO you have 1 hour to eat a living being before the parasites inside you start to wreck havoc survive long enough for the parasites to evolve to gather larger hordes take out remaining humans.
Tbh that works better as a normal MP game.
Well or an event in an survivor MMO.
I mean if anything the old Zombie invasion event in WoW showed that those things are fun and appreciated.
MairBear apparantly tavern brawls are IMMINENT.
Like being rolled out right now.
They come into the tavern and then starts brawling.
In fact mine just started updating!
They're actually doing FF7 HD.
It's like making DNF 2.
You just don't do it.
It's like remastering Space Invaders this year and from scratch but also you've been publishing Galaga for the last two decades and pretending it's the same game.
They're both horrifying myths nobody needs.
Mine wasn't updated it seems.
There is a you completed all your daily quests message if you log in now.
In case you didn't realize.
Mine updated but the brawl button isn't there yet.
MoonWolf Well you know some people.
However the other client changes are there.
Card back managing etc.
Cooked_Auto having finally gotten round to looking at this lamp.
But not fifty bux plus shipping cool sadly.
MoonWolf I like the hero buying interface.
If Priest is good I might buy it.
Noelor Yeah I imagine the shipping is the killer here as alwaysÂ¨.
I have a feeling if/when they add a priest it'll be Tyrande.
Cant really come up with any other goodie priests.
Who would be the paladin though?
Pretty sure Velen is dead and Whitemane is sadly evil.
Velen would be a priest anyway.
My money is on maraad.
Or the awesome paladin chick.
I forgot her name.
Possibly far fetched pre lichking arthas.
Yrel would make sense.
Or I guess Uther.
The blood knight boss.
Is she iconic enough though?
I hope they make the new druid the si7 druid of the talon spy.
Cooked_Auto if a character that only ever showed up in a comic was good enough for rogue.
Rogue COULD have been garona.
Well she did show up in game too.
But it was valeera instead because reasons.
I don't think she's SI7.
MoonWolf were those reasons the massive amount of orcs and the total lack of blood elves?
Gimme some thisalee crow.
The DotC are just a sorta parallel sub-faction.
MairBear she's only half orc!
Wait has Garona actually been a card?
Garona has not been in the game in any form yet.
Totes 2nd rogue then.
Van Cleef being a card.
And who else even y'know?
Vanessa or her dad?
Vanessa could be a rogue.
Also not that this is at all a rare occurence but I don't get today's Penny Arcade.
Her dad is already a legendary.
I imagine daddy Van Cleef since everybody remembers DM.
I'm not saying legendaries can't be heros.
But untill it happens i'm not counting on it.
Imo having VC as a card precludes his daughter being a hero.
Noelor I assume injoke for PAX.
They've got no problem making badguys cards.
Like idk maybe Garrosh/Grommash is the counterpoint to what I'm saying but.
Vanessa is just Van Cleef but his daughter.
And yeah she's actually got way more going on in-game but she's not the same level in people's heads.
I'd prefer garona anyway.
Any other famous rogues in wow.
Maybe in some si7 related quests ?
That is a loooooong stretch of logic G-dorf.
Or that rogue legendary questline ?
MoonWolf rogue legendary revolved around being a rogue employed by Deathwing's son.
Was deathwings son rogue-ish ?
Nah his class is just dragon.
They should have made Chromie a mage!
But then again Chromie is Chromie.
Apprantly we only get to brawl on wednesday.
Getting me all excited.
Wednesday's brawlday didn't you know?
Well it is Mini-Saturday after all.
So clearly a perfect time to do brawling.
Must be different for asia because they get to brawl on thursday.
Noelor i blame the transformation powers.
Let's go with that.
She has Lola Bunny in her transformation repertoire.
Oh nvm looked up.
Cooked_Auto panel 3.
Nah I got what you were talking about.
For a second I thought it was still in HS mode.
Also apparently EGSNP accidentally just ended up on a Grace plays Chrono Trigger storyline.
An LP in a webcomic? How meta.
That's what you get for using ultimate lasers in such a confined space.
Going to play some HS.
See if i can find any of the new heroes in the wild.
So George RR Martin is coming here next week that'll be interesting.
To Stockholm? Yeah I saw.
I take it you already grabbed a ticket? P.
All I knew was that he's going to SFBok in Stockholm next week-ish.
Hopefully he wont eat you all off the island with his banquets.
Sci-fi and fantasy convention here.
Ah I imagine that place will be Packed.
He'll be surrounded by vikings I doubt he can eat all of them.
Tickets are sold out but I can queue in unless I'm busy with Ed.
Busy eh? Couldnt resist p.
She said she'll cuddle the grumpy out of you btw.
That is a tall task indeed.
Careful she might get spaghetti stains.
...I am so confused by that response.
It'sa fine she's italian she'll magically absorb it.
Noelor Spelling spaghetti is a a mind worm regarding being awkward around people.
Especially of the opposite sex in this case.
They land on the 24th next week and leave on the 30th from Skavsta will spend most of the time in Stockholm.
Cooked_Auto just assume she has the biggest dick because she does.
It's huge she laid it out on a table once and the table broke.
And here I thought horse futa was only reserved for Warcraft fanfiction p.
She probably started the futa genre sometime in the 17th century.
I was just going to blame Greeks.
Cooked_Auto finished lonesome road it payed off better than I anticipated.
Its a perfect ending to the DLC saga and I almost wish it was the ending for FONV itself.
It would maybe feel a bit 'press button recieve ending' if so. So I am glad that there's some level of impact to whatever you choose. But having not seen the official ending yet I might eat my words later.
Yeah I still havent seen it either.
Im right at the dam fight but last time I tried my computer chugged so bad.
Now you plans wut.
As mentioned last night Peter Stormare performance in TSW is amazing.
C_A do you have accommodation plans?
Edilith Need to book something in this case.
Been waiting for solid details before doing anything but I can probably see what I can get this week.
Boat is expensive stop having expensive fetishes.
T and I are toying with the idea of staying on the boat for 3 nights for shits and gigs. meaning there'd be space for everyone essentially.
Wait the boat hotel or a boat that you are sailing?
Yeah it's more expensive than getting an apartment but lots of room and if you both wanted to pay say a sixth and T and I pay a third each that's ok.
FYI I'm sailing to you in a dinghy see you for Christmas.
You're going east if you meet happy people you've reach norway.
If they're drunks then that's denmark.
I mean there are like two different boat hotels in Stockholm in this case.
It's a private owned boat.
<- that boat.
Never actually done that before.
WHICH IS WHY BOAT!
SHE NEEDS TO FULFIL HER FANTASY TO FINALLY ASCEND.
But also no pressure I want everyone to be comfortable it's just a possibility.
Well otherwise I'd just have to book a hotelroom somewhere.
Is the cuddlefish around?
C_A are you planning on being in Stockholm for the whole time or just a few days?
I can either or really.
Nothing on my calender.
Then again I have no idea what to really do for a whole week in Stockholm. But then again most of my visits have been rather focused on specific things so who knows.
Does the boat for three days sound like something you both would want / is financially feasible? I know Kaun wants to stay with me what about you C_A? I don't want to pressure.
Tbh I'm thinking ferry to Aland or further afield for at least one night.
I still got a huge chunk of money left from last years work and just got like 700eu in tax returns so money is honestly not much of an issue.
I mean sharing living would make things a lot easier tbh.
T is now crying because the boat has been booked anyway so that simplifies things.
We must ferry. I need my boat kicks.
Okedoke well are you both comfortable with renting an apartment over a hotel?
Any specific requirements from anyone?
Does anyone have any objections to a small commute to the city etc.
Also I asked dad about renting apartment. The reply I got? Laughter. v.
It might not be the cheapest or the easiest to get.
There are plenty on there although I haven't been looking for 4 people. usually ~60-120 GBP per night.
The trouble will be finding somewhere not gross not in the wild where we all don't have to spoon in a single bed p.
You want at least two beds to spoon in.
Ooh dibs on the welsh one.
Are Welsh beds fancier than Swedish ones?
Noelor we can just lie across the width of the bed with our feet hanging over.
I'll just fold away into the wardrobe.
I think Kaun and CA are both taller than beds are tall.
It's gonna be like Jukly but way better because I'm there. also it's Sweden.
Kaun is 2D it's fine he can just lie on his side.
Noelor There are 2m beds.
I'll slice through the bed if I lie on my side.
You can sleep in the middle of us all in the warmest bit.
Alas I have no holiday allowance left for a trip to the wild north.
Noelor go to aber get kidnapped return a week later.
Cooked_Auto>> MU Velen is alive AU Velen isn't.
I got kidnapped it was very strange they put me on a boat then in between two giants one of whom disappeared in the middle of the night and then they let me go.
Cooked is the only giant.
Kaunmoth I thought you had a normal person's volume squeezed upward like toothpaste?
Maybe that's just gi.
Why did I try to tab-complete that he's never here.
That's gim.. I tried to tab aswell.
Why is Gim never here?
I'm a ginger gollum.
Your voice is too deep!
He's busy with real life nerdery.
Fine I'm a ginger gollum that got fingered by barry white.
Noelor get kidnapped and demand smurfs presence for a week as ransom.
MairBear you'll be the negotiator.
He's busy with the news cycle.
Glenn is the foreign diplomat overseeing things to make sure that there are no russians around also he has a pipe.
What have I missed since I left? Gimble is nerding it up IRL and Smurf is in Scotland now writing stuff.. what else?!
Who cut off all their hair. Every time someone's done that when I've come back...
Lol TOR on the EA conference.
I have fairly short hair.
Probs gonna start growing it out again this year though.
You get a gold star and a pardon then.
Also it's currently pinkish more like sun-bleached red.
What have I done?
The cutting of the stuff.
Where it's not brown.
I trimmed my beard.
Yeah kaunmoth. Stop the butts.
Your butt is all over the channel.
I don't have a butt you maximus glutinus people!
Edilith also I decided to stop having a gender because they're bullshit.
High fives if you're not joking.
Well I haven't had any documents changed because effort.
They are bullshit confirmed.
All hail the royal tits best line this episode gg GoT.
I don't think I've ever understood them or felt like I belonged in one.
I've only watched the first ep of the latest season because I suck.
Season's over now though so you can binge it before/while travelling!
I've had to keep up because of people in the office talking about it.
No offense but why do most of the apartments in Sweden look like they're owned by hippies.
I work in an open office but some people seem not to notice.
Edilith because they're owned by Swedes.
I mean like.. so many tie dye blankets.
I own a faux-tiedye t-shirt now.
Just because it's purple and violet stripes.
We need a UK meetup..
I'd wear coloured clothes if I had a fashion sense.
I hope Cooked_Auto is prepared for cuddling.
I don't pretend to have one of those.
I just wear what I like.
Kaunmoth you have a fashion sense it's called black.
What was I negotiating for Noelor for? Do I get a cut?
Edi Sure once the panic settles since I get touched by a girl I'll be fine P.
I have an awesome orange coat that was my grandfathers.
MairBear you get cuddles from ed.
Silly Cooked_Auto 'a girl' rofl.
Kaunmoth tell him I'm not a girl.
Cooked_Auto ed's not a girl.
Edi Well some kind of facsimlie then.
MairBear come to Sweden plz.
Close enough so to speak vOv.
How do I sweden c.
My penis now you're here.
Try to control yourself.
This ass can't take too many more poundin's.
Something something plenty of it etc.
The girliest thing ed does is sometimes says please and thanks.
Lol what a girl.
Remember that one time I made you beautiful Smurf.
Smurf is always beautiful.
I think you'll find.
Why you GoTta GoT GoT.
Noelor because GoT ?
I had to literally sleep on a floor to maintain my manliness after that.
NOT ANY MORE THANKS TO YOU.
ChaosSmurf okay i'm not the only one who thought cute feelings of yarn int highway to the dangerzone custome was INCREDIBLY DUMB.
ChaosSmurf is the most macho.
Noelor did you finisht he episode.
MairBear did you cut your hair?
Who has long hair? NO ONE?!
I think i was one of the previous culprits.
Glenny? Surely not Glenny.
No wait maybe Glenn still does.
He wouldn't do such a thing.
My beard is the new hair.
Is it of a braidable length ChaosSmurf.
It probably has been.
Does it have adequate space for items such as I don't know a bow.
You'd have to spend a day getting it straight enough first is the thing I think.
Edilith you're going to viking country you don't need smurfs beard to smuggle weapons.
Why are you going to a viking country.
I missed all this.
Edi's going on a summer holiday.
I'm going to cuddle the shit out of Cooked_Auto.
Noelor the cold is worth seeing kaunmoth.
CA is bricking it it's pretty funny.
Wut? it's not cold during summer.
Cooked_Auto don't be scared. I'm likely smaller than you.
She is a tiny baby-man.
Edilith I'm not. I was joking p.
It's the 5 foot dick we fear.
Lonely nerd etc etc.
He's putting on a brave face.
He's gonna catch the cooties.
And your ability to hide it usually in someone elses butt.
I knew science was lying to me. They do exist.
Why do so many Swedes have their washing machine and tumble dryer in the bathroom?
I haven't even left the house and you guys are confusing me.
Cooked_Auto if she gets too handy then just point at someones boobs and she gets distracted.
Wait until you see the drying cupboard over the sink.
Edi Lack of space I imagine.
Kaunmoth that thing is genius mate don't even.
Reddit showed me those kaunmoth seriously wtf.
I'm installing one in my place when I move.
Noelor they're standard freaking love em.
All of the nordic countries.
Edilith come to Newcastle and teach me how to makeup so I can hide my disgusting face-stubble -.
I totally would you know.
OH GOD IT'S SO FAR AWAY.
I don't understand make-up or life.
ChaosSmurf it's not about the makeup so much as it is about not having the stubble.
You're ~6hours away <.
If I were blessed with fairer hair it wouldn't be an issue.
Meet you in the Peak District?
No arriva is just shite ed.
I totally would still want to do makeup though it just wouldn't be such a must.
You say that kaunmoth and google maps is showing 3 diggy triangle men near Aber. rofl.
Edilith Place looks okay but commuting might be a bother.
I would make you beeyootifuler Noelor.
Noelor I can't stop imagining you dressed as I imagine Mori-san to be now.
Apparently there's a bus.
There should also be train.
MairBear I wish I had the genes.
Edilith google visual kei.
Edilith it is Mair's current rpg character.
In my game of wizards witches Mori Himori is a wizch.
Edi there is even ferry.
Golf now in the frostbite engine!
Noelor can I come stay with you for a weekend and we can stay up and do Pinterest makeup tutorials and watch anime.
I am not going to say no to that.
ChaosSmurf gold now with pack opening!
Noelor f the genes just need the right dyes and clothing.
I am going to say that I'm moving this summer.
You can drink wine if you like.
Where are you moving to? Or just moving house?
Moving out of my folks'.
Into a flat still in Newcastle but all of my own.
Even better flatwarming party.
Well 10%ish of my own and 90%ish of the bank's.
Oh yeah no when I actually find a place and get a date there will totes be an all-people flatwarming invite.
Newcastle isn't -that- far... just most of a day.
Mair where are you/.
I have such a terrible memory.
I nearly reflex gave you the wrong city.
Trying to throw me off the trail!
Anyway I want my own place so that I can among other things own makeup and also skirts and... smaller things... without worrying about my mum digging them out of the washing machine.
You're closer but still 5 and a half hours away.. <.
Noelor I'll bring dresses.
Also y'know ideally have a conversation with them about this shite that doesn't have to end with so... I'll just be upstairs.
But one step at a time.
Cooked_Auto slightly more expensive but DAT BATH.
Here's the thing the logical part of my mind thinks they'd ultimately be okay with it.
Edilith Adn even further away tbh.
The REST of my brain reflexively curls into foetal coccoon at the very thought of talking about it.
Ed gone from a boat to a house with a bath that can fit a boat.
I have two boats.
The first apartment seems okay both buss train and ferry access.
When I asked if either of you had specific requirements you didn't mention it had to be x km from the city or have a bath smaller than y.
Or three but one is grounded and filled with dirt and growing potatoes.
I should have gone to bed 5 hours ago which is why I think it's a good idea to say this but Noelor I can totes empathise with that.
She's right you didn't say that CA/KM.
Noelor got my back yo. I am going to make Noelor extra beyoots now.
Edilith Point taken but I'd just like to point it out because of commuting.
Noelor I guess all the advice I have is don't feel rushed into anything.
Cooked_Auto know stockholm better than I do.
Thanks I'm taking my own pace so far =>.
I just walk around the city!
Noelor you'll be fine. at least you can always rant here.
Or get kidnapped to gothenburg / oslo.
25min by a pendeltag whatever the fuck that is.
Exactly. We'll always love you Noelor <3.
I'm glad you can talk to us about it.
And sometimes Dob individually.
I think Noelor needs the cuddles more than Cooked_Auto but you're too far so C_A will just get extras intended for you in spirit.
Finns and swedes must never touch.
Well put her inbetween me and glenn then or something vOv.
Cooked_Auto what's your email? So I can just email the three of you boys and let you all bicker over which one we choose.
You know a coworkerfriend of mine is with us too yeah?
Kaun has mentioned as much.
There's something a bit wrong about someone offering an apartment with rent with a kids room full of toys.
Yeah the check in is also a bit odd.
My vote would be either Boat if available or.
How do you mean?
I'd go for the Nacka apartment almost.
I mean if you want to go a lot by ferry this is obviously the place to pick P.
Nacka seems nice yeah.
Such haste >.> I will dig up many more.
And the most affordable I think.
Well we're trying to narrow down the options a little P.
See Cooked_Auto this happens whenever I have an opinion.
Ed assumes you secretly haven't thought about it enough?
Ed knows I'm stupid I get a pat on the head and a cup of coffee while the grown ups discuss things.
DoW2 Retribution has some of the best ork dialogue I've heard.
EG *while fighting Eldar* I set my gitfinda to pansie boss - they're over there!
I didn't know orks had dialogue.
So much as shouting and then shooting things.
Orks in DoW are in general amazing.
Also while i remember Noelor a thing has emerged on thursday evenings. A low priority thing but a thing that would make me very greatful of advance notice of cancelled sessions o.
Remember there's not one this week then.
No games at all this week.
Its a gameless week.
I have a tutorial Ana is in Scotland.
Just because E3? =<.
Because MairBear cancelled tihs wednesday.
I didn't have Exalted this week either =<.
For the third week running.
Well if it was Mair that's okay.
Student Finance England won't let me leave title as Please Select.
I actually want to receive a letter addressed to Dear Please Select Storr...
I cancelled cos some silly friend of the family is getting married.
To be fair they're both awesome people so it's one of those weddings I actually WANT to attend.
No just do your fmaily thing.
Yeah I'm actually okay with not having games this week.
I am! But only because it's one of my less british sleep pattern weeks >.>.
Lets me do grown-up stuff also finish up the compulsory elements of this year's uni course.
Also get to bed at decent times.
To bed at decent times is not happening today.
Not for you maybe.
I need to watch xcom 2 footage at e3.
Luckily for me I don't give a shit about watching E3 live!
Yeah I'll be waiting for Matt Lees to break it down for me.
EA conference is all about the Scandinavians.
Cooked_Auto is there a uboat in stockholm?
Hmm I think so.
I know that Karlskrona Naval Museum has one.
Edi I'm going to facebook you if that's ok~.
It's getting close to working out where I work live.
You'll help throw it off the scent =P.
Haha.. oh I see how it is.
VPN and check in a bunch of times around australia.
I set up my account in Kyoto.
I need help I'm stuck in a Skype call.
So I got Japanese ads for my first few months.
Noelor is fearing for their life in Australia.
Edilith show the skype call the lovely picture I sent you.
Just out of masochism.
What is weird about this list.
Is quite often I find people one degree further removed than I'd expect.
For instance I think I just scrolled past my boss' husband.
Having not seen my boss anywhere in here.
Gotta say SW Battlefront looks pretty good. I won't play it because I don't like MP games but it still looks pretty good.
Seen two different friends of an ex but not actually her.
I have a ton of suggestions for people I don't know that went to the same school 10 years ago that I don't care about.
I only actually saw two school people.
I mostly get people I already got on my list but I dont know.
One is I think still the bf of someone I actually follow and interact with so fair enough.
The other is... a girl I had a crush on who I have no idea who it's finding a link through.
Maybe Dob's sister somehow.
I think I have like one old classmate on my FB list.
It was probs another dick knowing you two.
I am a dick I don't dickpic.
Annul just added me to bookface I'll probably regret accepting.
Cooked_Auto email please I want to subscribe you to my travel agency mailing list.
Let me remind you of you arriving in the channel mere hours ago.
Jun 15 204108 ten foot dick.
Jun 15 204126 Can confirm.
Edilith cookedauto@gmail.com lets go with that address in this case.
A ten foot cock and a few hundred virgins.
I thought I recognised it.
Cooked_Auto no need to be secretive I'm gonna see your face soon enouhg.
Take your cuddle virginity.
Edi true and you have me on FB so p.
I never see any of your stuff in my feed.
Maybe it filters out the moonlanguage.
It's all in Swedish yeah.
I'm sure I had.. what's his name.
Who was that Finnish kid.
Oh neat Gothenburg is now running an electrical bussline.
Phantom Pain? more like Phantom Helicopters amirite?
Drat forgot to link Edi something. Oh well. It can wait.
Nah but seriously MGSPP looks p hype can't wait for Chip to play it so I don't have to.
In other news the US might get another Bush president. This is like the Roosevelts but less... something.
Yeah it's Bush/Clinton for the third time or something.
Jeb Bush has announced his campaign.
I really cant take a president named Jeb seriously.
Oh I played Enchanted arms a few months ago a from software rpg. christ it won't let go of your hand.
Oh new South Park game.
South Park Fractured but whole.
Can players be girls this time?
So wait when is the stockholm thing?
They're arriving on the 24th at least.
And staying until the 30th.
Arrive 24th afternoon/evening leave earlyish on the 30th.
Oh if they're arriving that late on the 24th I could probably just take a late flight or a train and spend most of the day in transit.
Granted flying is still cheaper so I guess I could hang around in Stockholm for a while waiting for them.
I'll probably get to stockholm around noonish.
He has to be I mean ther'es XCOM2 streaming soon.
Yeah I was about to say.
Currently watching the gameplay for new shadowarrior.
I kinda did the same to one of my SR players who loves the series.
Thi sgame looks SICK.
Need to finish the first one at some point.
The first one was really.
Not as good as it should have been.
I really liked it.
I should have done.
I just rano ut fo steam with it after 4 hours or so.
I'd play it with coop.
It had the right balance of just awesome guns a sword not taking it very seriously and sometimes taking it seriously and meshing that together.
XCOM 2 after the break.
Yeah i tuned in just in time to watch advertisments.
Edge stop trying to be old spice.
That sihp has sailed.
Where are you watching.
Want to be synch'd boyo.
We still have a name t hat fits nicely into Fix Your Game X.
Garth for this guy.
Fix Your Game GarthJake.
Fix Your Garth Jake.
Oh.. what.. shit.. fuck you IGN.
Lololol your IP is Finnish so we'll show you just the finnish site and every fucking article is in finnish.
Ubuntu installed UK version browser english FUCK THE IP ARSECUNTS.
His neck is snake.
Yeah that guy isn't a thinman hybrid.
I really awnt the general to be in here.
Oh boy this looks.
Zoom that camera out.
I can't even see the whole squad at once.
Yeah this is zooooomed.
This general is a lot shittier than other general.
Okay this definitly isn't xcom.
Both those shots hit.
Also a rookie is being useful.
And not using grenades.
Ahahahaha what the fuck.
Alright the engine looks a little more polished.
CS Would you happen to have spares of Summer card 5 and 6 btw?
The bomb is xcom logo shaped.
You can have 'em.
Because OFCOURSE IT IS.
At least the reinforcements don't just magically drop in from the top of the map.
If you have a spare of 9 I'd appreciatre it.
Hacking is cool as shit.
I missed the minigame.
Becuase it just goes fuck your actione economy.
Was there a minigame.
ChaosSmurf no just a randomized roll on a skill.
Oh god that berserker.
Pun on some ARMOR.
He's a big lad.
And she's dead as shit.
That looks like a good game.
Now let me build a MEC.
So i can push that berserker in the face.
Cooked_Auto what's the actual name of the cards you want.
Sigmond Crusta-Sean and Dansky are the ones Im missing.
If you've got a spare of Z-Lo it'd be nice.
Don't have a danksy.
Sounds like the missions are FAAAAAR more interesting.
CS Aight. Still a couple of days left anyway and I've got a foil I can sell.
Hopefully accents aren't replacing language.
Even if the price for it is rapidly dropping.
FUck it selling the foil now before it becomes worthless.
Summer sale cards yes.
I have sigmond danksy and zlo if you want em.
I assume you have me on Steam or?
Right time for beds.
Cooked_Auto accept the trade pls.
Oh I thought I did.
Maybe I didn't send it.
I've pressed the buttons now.
Kaunmoth No need for a sigmond card now but the others I can take btw.
Cancel and I'll send the others.
Dont bother already accepted it so.
Steam being slow on the update too many frugal people.
Aaaw now FF has stopped saving my pinned tabs /.
I liked having gdocs pinned for whenever I want to do some writing.
Oh I see why I think.
Ah ok shadow process for FF was running so it counted as having the pinned tab open.
Next week? oh dear. not sure I can afford that on top of other things.
I think FF7 HD is actually happening.
I cant stay up.
But I want to believe.
But I cant believe in sony without staying up.
I am trying to.
But tired and I should sleep.
Since I have to be up tomorrow to play D AND MOTHERFUCKING D MOTHAFUCKAZ.
There there coffee makes it all better.
I sure as hell am not going to drink coffee now.
But I have the next best thing.
Never mix coffee and alcoho.
For it is a sin upon the eyes of The Lord.
Also palate of The Lord.
The nose of The Lord is intrigued though.
Cant comment on that.
Last motherfucking guardian confirmed.
They legit have both.
Even so sony is winning e3 already.
So how about them robot dinosaurs.
Hitman The catwalk chronicles.
Hitman Look at our clocks.
Is so not a real video game.
Depends on how you define a game agai.
GlennCuttlefish how's it going.
Okay so here is the thing i don't get about the pipboy interface.
Here is your menu.
First we took half the screen away with chrome.
Then we made it monochrome and hard to read.
Also we thought you wanted a nice long animation of looking at your wrist when you go to access it?
MairBear did you watch xcom 2 gameplay yet ?
Oh wait that was CA.. not MoonWolf.
Cooked_Auto doesn't get to have any cheers ?
Bradford is no where near as rugged enough C.
MoonWolf that new berserker.
In case you were wondering.
I somehow doubt any missions beyond the first will be that cinematic.
There are also a bunch of things just different.
Like no fog of war.
Or the extra actions nobody shoul dbe getting.
I hope they show some proper gameplay tomorrow.
It'll be shite though.
ChaosSmurf people on my Facebook are saying that bloke who died totally didn't die yet and will be brought back from the brink no really you don't get it that one lady has all the magic he can't be dead etc.
Game of thrones stuff ?
I think post-book Thrones stuff too.
Good news Bonsai can now generate Chinese names.
Dob is the only person in this channel who could confirm I think.
Character + pin yin?
They are pinyin i believe.
Because my source used that.
Pin yin check one of the most common names is Zhang.
I have a Zhang plus a variety of Zhang and other stuff.
Like Zhanglei or Jianzhang.
Okay so ff7 right.
Yeah thats a thing.
Really curious how faithful it's going to be.
And predict it'll be insufficiently goofy.
I really really hope they change the combat.
But don't make some completly realtime system.
Does that make sense ?
You don't want FF15's.
I wouldn't complain about the FF13s' but I think I'm in a minority.
I feel the ff13 took to much choice away.
You didn't pick what to do you picked what AI package you wanted.
Hell half of the time you didn't even really decide what attacks your own character was going to use.
Things the FF13s' combat did right you have to pay attention to what's going on status effects matter.
Because they were only good for one thing in a mode and if it had elemental weaknesses the system auto picked those too.
Things it did wrong too little input.
My only hope for FF7 is that we get Cloud in a variety of HD dresses.
Complete with wigs and pretty makeup.
I knew people didn't think he was actually gone.
I'm willing to sacrifice Cloud being raped by Freddy Mercury.
Minister if that happens i'm going to have to listen to a week of trans people complaining about how its only being played for laughs.
And i genuinly don't look forward to that.
But if he doesn't pimp himself to Don Corneo it's not the same game.
They have to either change absolutely nothing about that scene.
Or cut it completely.
And I prefer the former.
Would bet on them cutting it.
But I want it to stay.
It's probably the least offensive cross-dressing scene I've seen in video games.
Which says a lot.
Especially given its from Japan in the 90s.
ChaosSmurf how many of those have you even seen ?
Usually it's just like.
TREVOR WOKE UP IN A DRESS IN GTA 5 HAR-HAR-HAR.
Everyone in the gym being gay to the point of setting the building in fire.
I get the feeling.
That whole bit will be redesigned.
If there's any western influence at all.
Minister goes to very different gyms than i imagine they are normally like.
But that whole sequence is offensive to basically everyone.
Which I guess maybe makes it okay.
MoonWolf the gym in FF7 obv.
I have not played ff7.
I have not seen an lp of 7.
I only know stuff about 7 through osmosis.
Ok well in order to get... I think the dress.
Have you not watch LPs.
ChaosSmurf i think 7 is dumb.
And the 3d is just painful.
Cloud needs to impress men at a gym.
That is not how you get dresses!
And or get them from women in th eparty maybe.
Not from guys at a gym.
Fairly sure he takes it up the butt to get the dress.
And because of Japanese gender stereotypes all the men at the gym ie men who spend their time half naked and sweaty around other men.
Why is a main character prostituting himself for a dress!
MoonWolf so he can better prostitute himself to save um...
So its a gym full of hardo gay ?
Because he needs to look like a gurl to get into Don Somethingo's house.
Because the Don likes to hire prostitutes.
And is easily impressed by nice dresses and tiaras.
Prostitutes on the whole don't really wear what i would classify as Nice Dresses.
Or tiaras for that matter.
Looks like MoonWolf's been with those classless prozzies.
The battlezone remake looks.
Words I'm saying in 2015.
ChaosSmurf you know what did not get any attention ?
You can watch 25 or so minutes from it from IGN FIRST a while back.
I want to see a guy walk through a wood and discussing bear markings.
Fairly sure I posted it on RPS if you want to go search the tag.
It looks v. good.
I've seen that one.
But i want more.
Just release the game.
I'm fairly sure they could release a game a week for the next 3 years out of stuff currently announced and I would want to play all of them.
When are they releasing that space game with dinosaurs that can't be real ?
Firewatch ff7 mgs 5 last guardian eitr that thing with the dinosaurs blops 3 mass effect nms.
Clouds dedication to tits should be commended that he is fully willing to cross dress to get a chance at them P.
Is That Thing With Dinosaurs the real title?
I think he means No Man Sky or something that got announced at Sony's.
Ah I know I saw something about that but didnt bother to check my twitter backlog too far back.
Meanwhile Im amused at myself for actually being interested in Ubisoft games again. Both Division and Ghost Recon Cocaine Mountain looks interesting.
People were like LOL JUST THE SAME UBI GAME.
And I was like.
It's a massive open world co-op tactical thing.
What AssCreed have you been playing.
As someone who is all for co-op nowadays I'm interested.
I mean I could even handle doing the Division MP because I'll most likely play with people I rely on.
Because fuck playing with any kind of pubbie group of any kind.
MoonWolf Darkest Dungeon patch note.
Crit heals will no longer happen on 0 HP heals potentially resulting in less snarky comments on the Internet.
MairBear i wouldn't bet on it.
MairBear when are they putting in the final dungeons so i can play it though.
After they put in the cove.
I love the new Arbalest class.
But for a chick carrying a ballista.
She does low damage.
Check if the string isn't loosing its tension.
Does anyone particularly wish to have me add a particular country to the name generator ?
Are you asking for suggestions or just genuine interest?
I can make korea happen.
I am looking forward to play Darkest Dungeon upon release.
They also keep doing intuitive things like a button that lets you click next/previous hero in latest patch Rather than having to close window and open new one.
Are they adding fake scripted teamspeak.
I can only really relate to games now if they have fake teamspeak in their trailers.
*this one is going over my head*.
Its an e3 trailor thing.
Especially well loved in team shooty things.
Where they have LIVE GAMEPLAY.
But they are using rehearsed team voip talk.
And its SO AWKWARD.
Its more awkward than putting what we'd actually say on teamspeak/mumble on there.
Tbh the stage talk was a lot better than that shit in the trailer.
Because its just so obvious nobody talks like that.
Minister i can do french too.
Sure the stage chat was rehearsed but it sounded a lot more like how gamers talk while they play.
Instead of something out of West Wing or a casual stroll down the street kind of way.
There was one that actually sounded good.
I think rainbow six.
MoonWolf Yeah that's the stage one I was referring to.
I will never undersatnd.
The obviously not live play live demos.
ChaosSmurf well live this is hwo it really works demonstrations are good because well people care about your actual game as opposed to your cgi trailer.
Don't bring a dude out.
To play on stage.
But on the other hand they suck because you can't show everything you want to all the time in the best light.
Who clearly isn't actually playing in any meaingful way.
So now you get a dude on stage playing a completly pre-rehearsed planned and scripted LIVE demo.
It would make the ones that actually are real so much better.
Look a guy is standing on stage pressing buttons.
It MUST be real.
Dat hololens shit though.
To draw a comparison to xcom.
Finally we can play god.
That was clearly prerecorded.
And at the end they were like x y and z just don't work that way in the real game.
I'm glad they admitted.
But its better to show it off this way.
The snake doesn't just pull you out and murder you in one turn dropings don't get free actions there is a fog of war. etc.
MairBear holy fuck korean family names.
ChaosSmurf do you remember Shepard's default names?
Like more than half the total korean population is either a Kim Park or Lee.
There is less than 300 total!
So i've taken 30.
And given them some weights.
What about john ?
Obviously the only correct name for Shepard is Adrian I.
Also today in Swedish news a robot lawnmower on the loose and a Bear running over a bear.
That sure is news.
Bear bumps into other bear.
That's Shep's default name.
MoonWolf No a guy named BjÃ¶rn Bear runs over a bear by accident.
ChaosSmurf John and Jane?
I never played a wimmins.
French and korean.
ChaosSmurf I was asking because we paid a Jane Shepard today.
And now the Commander Shepard song is in my head.
Kirisu something something favourite on the citadel.
MoonWolf can I trade for one of your dupe monster cards in steam?
Oh wait it's not a duplicate.
Drat gave my dupe I got from Kaun of that card to another friend.
MairBear today in ground breaking nintendo announcement.
Shiiieeet a new Metroid Prime game.
My silly monster game keeps lagging just in time to miss every boss v.
MairBear Turns out I somehow got 5 cards and one of them was a spare Z-Lo.
Yeah I dunno how I suddenly got 5 cards. Maybe from the finish monster game of the day or something vOv.
I got none yesterday at all and then 4 today when I joined new one so I think it's a delay thing.
ChaosSmurf why is Pip tweeting the creepiest muppet.
Sorry bit distracted as well.
Why are you retweeting it.
Email not getting through yet o<.
Did you get one or is steam just overcrowded or something?
As in I got an email.
Well the monster game is a laggy shithole atm.
Oh would you look at that.
The FF7 LP has over a hundred new posts.
Well he's gotta start again soon.
Minister the muppet was from N's conf.
Pretending this remake will be out in this decade.
Cooked_Auto fairly sure the ether has devoured that email at this point.
I get an error when trying to resend it so it worked for me.
It turns out that this was the way to bring Aeris back to life all along hah.
The slap battle will become an extended fight sequence =<.
The perfect outfit in the crossdressing scene should just be Lightning since she has the exact same face model as high definition Cloud does heehee.
I think i just heard chip cheezum have an orgasm on stream.
Because square enix has a new thing and it included platinum in the title.
And then the designer for revengence was in credit.
Also yoko taro is involved.
Wtf IS this game.
Yoko taro and platinum are apparantly making a new nier.
So that'll be a THING.
Yoko taro is dressed up AS EMILE.
And the drakengard 3 thread has 12 new posts.
Also the best actor for Sephiroth would be Kevin Spacey.
Best actor for everything.
MoonWolf staying up for PC in case of Hearthings?
What time is that ?
Looks like it's Heroes anyway.
Oh man I almost want to play dota2 now.
Glenny will you be Stockholming?
Err. Maybe? Cant say for certain yet. Need to figure out if I can somehow afford it.
When exactly was it.
Days. also looking kinda grim all of the affordable cabins on the boat are reserved for the whole week.
Wait how is this so expensive. I am sure I managed to do the whole thing for maybe 50e last time.
Now the cheapest cabins I can find are 80e.
Can't you just swim on over? You're a cuddlefish <.
EU regulations forbid it.
Maybe if I take the bus to turku then boat from there.
That's a very contrived route.
Well its the only one that wont end up costing me loads.
Throw a beetroot at minsk blame the danes and hitch a ride with the russians?
Look I dont want to trust the russians to do anything right.
Glenny if I get my way and we stay in the house with the giant bath you can stay with us if needed.
As in spare bed not in the bath.
Cuddlefishes need water though.
I think we could all sleep in that bath if we fill it with pillows.
How big is this bath ?
I might be exaggerating a tiny bit.
But it is a BEYOOTIFUL BATH.
Because normally we call those things swimming pools.
We don't have such luxuries in Wales.
Ed just imagines everyone to be 2d.
We'll all fold up into origami boats.
Glenn its summer aka tourist season.
Also a fair amount of people going to stockholm and Ã¥land to see george martin that weekend.
Mhm. Well. i'll look into this tomorrow better and see if I can afford everything. maybe I'll find 50e under the couch.
Wait I dont own a couch.
If you swing by Ã¥land I'll help you rob a bank.
50e is what you need?
Is that ferry monies?
Kaunmoth they have banks there ?
50e is lowballing it possibly depending on how I can arrange things.
If I'm not mistaken they use rocks as currency there MoonWolf.
MoonWolf people in sheds with more guns than you have.
In their defense they are pretty rocks.
So he plans to robt a quarry.
Kaunmoth i have 0 guns so that is not hard.
Oh yeah I gave you a rock.
Guns or rocks ?
Bank has more <.
Those biceps of yours don't count as guns kaunmoth.
So I was just going through stuff I missed in todays E3.
And I have to ask Wait WHAT? by WHO?
You missed new nier?
I was away all day.
But by PLATINUM of all developers.
Everyone involved with it.
I am not sure platinum can pull this off honestly.
Like anything else I would trust to platinum but nier/drakengard just seems...They might make the gameplay GOOD.
And we wouldn't want nier 2 to have fun gameplay.
People might enjoy it then.
It would lose all that nier magic.
Of terribly mediocre gameplay.
Remaining installation time 135 minutes what are you doing computer.
Were we rpging tomorrow or on thursday?
MairBear is doing a wedding.
Noelor has uni stuff.
I believe its uni stuff anyway.
My memory is flawless.
Like a diamond of recollection.
And on Saturday I might not be RPGing because of flat stuff.
Which is a bit sad someone's running the new Paranoia.
Polished to perfection on the grinding stone of facts.
That is a bit sad.
ChaosSmurf look what I got at my flgs tonight.
CGP Grey posted New Video Why the UK Election Results are the Worst in History ok then.
Let's go all in on that.
Keep your evening pleasant.
Funny thing Emil is really nice he just sorta got cursed if I remember right.
Edilith if you think that's terrifying check the thumbnail of the youtube video I just facebooked.
Cooked_Auto aye something something sister.
Edi If you're lucky you should ask Glenn about Nier.
Pretty sure he rememebers more of it than me since he's actually played it.
Nier is awesome except for the fishing.
Also lol sony bias the ps3 version played a lot better than the xbox one which I currently have.
Wait what how is Steam sale day 6 already.
This is probably somehow ChaosSmurf's fault.
Time travel the monster game is actually producing 1.21 gigaclicks needed to power Gabens own steam machine.
MairBear i have 12 floater captives nobody wants to buy them.
Either they made the game easier.
Or i am just in a group of people who are really into stema monster game.
Because i'm levle 1017 already.
And its not even morning yet.
It's easier every day because people are figuring out when to use abilities and also have the big buffer at the start of a new game.
Also that there's no point upgrading anything past 10 et.
Yeah there isn't a lot of copmlexity or even interesting things in this game.
And i've not looked up guides but i'm pretty sure the best thing to do is to just buy the money upgrades at the start.
And kickstart your damage early with money.
Step one don't nuke the boss.
I get treasure to boost myself and spend the rest on raining gold.
Step two don't fucking nuke the boss.
And let poeple lcick the boss for sweet money.
If they are into actually clicking.
I'm level 1360 apparently check back once in a while spam boss do something else.
Triggering overwatch on your own turn.
Also looks like they upgraded explosions visually.
So which bits of that did they confirm were rigged?
I think you said earlier the one-shots both from and against the Viper?
A certain red-top on the new Top Gear host. Suddenly ginger-shaming!
Noelor there was no fog of war present but its in the game movementspeed were higher than normal. many things happened that would normally require multiple turns.
For instance the viper moved pulled and then constricted.
But she can't do that.
Further the constrict does damage like a seeker does.
It looked like the Advent all moved at once after the AI was done thinking about their turn.
With i believe a higher base damage.
I hope it is if it doens't make sense turn base wise for things to happen sequentially.
Do them at the same time.
The game can calculate ahead before displaying to make sure it all makes sense.
Like assuming they don't rely on other things happening.
All movement at once is just a really nice QoL thing.
Also the dropins getting to go right after the dropin not real.
And likely the amount of actions the last soldier took was fudged.
Yeah it did seem like he ran picked up called sprinted.
Because that was a move pickup calldown extraction zone and then a really long move.
So a bunch of not a real turn stuff.
But eg the sword could actually one-shot a viper/.
Even if picking up is not a move action but only click action like in EW.
Still seem like to much.
Because I remember them saying the sword attack from the trailer would have been suicidal in-game.
But it feels like viper < sectoid.
They have stated in reference too the trailer that normally the sword will not oneshot aliens.
Unless you're at endgame.
And doing it on lower level enemies.
Also probably quicker than a normal mission in other ways.
But still looks cool.
But it seemed like everything in that trailer was just lethal.
Anything that hit killed.
Which is expedient for showing stuff off.
But hard to gauge how it works for real.
Also silly thing i noticed.
The explosion they planted.
Shaped like the x-com logo shield.
!note MairBear I dreaded this day but it has come.
Right lets see if I can get witcher 3 to run.
Well I actually can run it at passable rate.
Maybe if I set everything to minimum it might even run smoothly..But I doubt it.
Seriously though Splatoon why does male inkling even exist.
2209 ChaosSmurf look what I got at my flgs tonight <--- did I never mention I thought it was kinda bad.
Dunno what it's like with expansions.
Played just 2 today.
I found it lacked depth.
Like I dunno if it's a game I'll play for ever.
Wtf is this outline effect on Ryu in Smash?
>Hadouken is stronger if you actually do the hadouken stick command.
Also not to hate but why is shoryuken an uppercut performed with a downward quarter-circle?
Ryu looks really cool I will never use him because I'm bad at video games.
Cause that is the SRK command.
Well that's what it is in Smash based on the Direct.
It's based on SF2 I think he said?
That should be the SRK motion.
Also I was wrong about the Iwata muppet being creepiest.
Omg Tetra gets pistols in Hyrule Warriors DS.
KING HYRULE TURNS INTO A BOAT TO ATTACK ENEMIES.
I'm getting this game.
Not even a question any more.
...Paper Mario Luigi.
I am very unsure how I feel about this.
On the edge? the interest is cutting it close?
That was less hype from a Metroid game than I thought possibl.
Co-op spin off sol.
Cooked_Auto I just hope it doesn't leave me flat.
Wait this one says Earthbound on it.
That can't be right.
Also I assume Glenn noticed Fatal Frame but it was somehow the wrong Fatal Frame and/or definitely not coming to Europe?
Yeah that new metroid title looked exceptionally early concept.
And even then it's a bit meh another hunters.
...oh is this Mother 1.
And they're pretending it's a prequel?
If anyone's curious what happened to my plan of getting to bed early it was either go through this playlist now and fuck my chances of going to the gym in the morning or read all this stuff during work tomorrow.
Noelor I havent seen the nintendo conference yet.
I was away all day.
My PC was off all day.
Only thing I've seen of todays announcements is nier 2 stuff.
Well I make no promises but is in the resultant playlist.
Well thats the same fatal frame just nothing new about it I think.
And so as Sound! Euphonium reaches e11 KyoAni remains a massive tease.
So no surprises there.
Will check it out once my net stops dying.
The PC conference is a whole lot of nothing so far.
And my twitter is just pages and pages of ChaosSmurf.
Hours of ChaosSmurf tweets.
Cooked_Auto does cats kill you?
Is he allergic to cats.
I do not know.
I don't think so but i don't KNOW so.
<- aaaand here comes the splatoon yuri.
Kaunmoth I dont have any allergies.
Cooked_Auto the request from last night was declined so they've found another house it seems but it has a cat so they just wanted to make sure no one died.
Im pretty sure Valve has expanded the Monster game upgrades now. Right now Im doing 2.6k auto damage v.
Mebe I should restart todays game.
Nah just let it run its course tbh.
Just had it minimized all day.
Which is what I do as well.
Idle gameplay acquire passives gain loot.
Then again I already got the badge so.
Bring on the mummy-vee.
People usually have had enough of work after like 7 or 8 hours.
My one solace is the confirmation of Cloud in a dress.
Alreadt linked the first one to you@home.
-> hmm.
Tzimisce's flesh-Geodudes are basically made entirely of blood.
Apparently added blood textures.
Because everything in Vampire is made entirely of blood.
That's... one helluva title.
Every time I forget how annoying ghosts are early game witcher.
And then I run into one or two.
Its a very Canadian scandal.
A very Canadian Scandal.
He had it coming for all those bear puns.
He's a Japanese bear MoonWolf.
If he didn't make puns I think he'd die.
Don't blame Teddie for what he is.
I can't relate to persona games unless they feature a MC that hates puns.
Cooked_Auto the thing that gets me about 'I Don't Care If My Best Friend's Mom Is a Sasquatch She's Hot and I'm Taking a Shower With Her'.
Is the publisher note.
T hats certainly a title.
Is 'The Dishes Are Done Man' the publisher? The series it's an entry in?
Amazon says its the publisher.
So last night I played a very interesting Investigation mission in TSW.
How the smeg did a publisher get a name like that.
Cooked_Auto Yay text adventures?
So uhm i was going to look up the publisher see what their deal is.
Its a text adventure you play and then use the game you played to find the location of the next part.
Found the following title A Gronking to Remember Book One in th erob Gronkowski Erotica Series.
Pretty sure The Dishes Are Done Man only publishes books by the author of I don't Care My Best Friend's Mom Is a Sasquatch She's Hot and I'm Taking a Shower With Her.
Also the writer of A Gronking to Remember 2 Chad Goes Deep in the Neutral Zone Rob Gronkowski Erotica Series Volume 2Jan 30 2015.
On a lighter note Ashley secretly EGS' kinkiest character who isn't Tedd?
Certainly seems into breasts.
Aw yiss imma have pulled pork tomorrow.
Kaunmoth cooked yourself ?
Grrngh everything is terrible.
In which way ?
Slept for...4 hours last night.
Woke up about as many times in between.
Still the best image this week.
Cooked_Auto yeah p good.
The fact that JW blew AoU out of the water with their opening week is pretty amazing too for that part.
Otoh not Cloud in a hd dress.
ChaosSmurf i'm not sure.
But nefarion seems a bit OP.
Hm. I wonder how well Roll20 plays on a tablet.
MoonWolf yeah dunno now.
He has some weak cards cause they're real.
But also he gets to draw a random carad and play it for free every time.
Its his massive early game advantage.
You just snowball into a win while rag is playing 3/2's.
He doesn't have 2 mana 6/6 taunters tho.
Or 2 mana 5/1s for 0 cards.
Yeah but rag has to hope to get those.
While nef is just playing 5 mana turns turn 1.
And playing random spells for 0 mana.
Over 11 pounds? Dedication..
11 pounds of boredom is still a lot of boredom.
I now realise my mistake on going on holiday to the middle of nowhere with my family.
How much of your family?
Noelor all of them.
So far the most offensive comment comes from my brother with â€œmale criminals have an incentive to be trans since women get lighter sentencesâ€.
You know your brother was going to be there?
Not until I had already said yes and booked flights.
That's fair enough then.
Where did you go Ana?
Nairn north of Scotland near Inverness.
But going with all of the family sounds.. interesting p.
At least I wont have to see them again until Christmas.
Yays 500â‚¬ comission if I sell my friends harley.
Does anyone want to buy a 2001 harley davidson soft-tail?
Found on the hike though so this hasn't been all bad.
Also had more snow on my summer holiday in Scotland than I get all winter down south.
So I thought I was getting to the end of Danganronpa then I got a hint that ended with by the way you're about half-way through the game now good work!
Also please mention gamergate to your brother.
ChaosSmurf don't want to be arrested for murder while on holiday.
Certainly would make for a memorable vacation.
Yeah he wants to wait until he'll get some time off work for the trial.
He'sjust a guy with a sword.
He's not a knight in the ruling noble class of wealthy landowners okay.
So he's a Street Sam then.
Stop adding metal sounding noises to his sheating and unsheathing.
I had one of the japanese mages draw their katana with that noise as a forces effect to buff their attacks.
Hating you a little right now.
Btw guys Danganronpa is sooo good.
Nah I can just read the LP instead. Less effort since I dont have a DS.
Heh level 4130 boss still dies within 10 seconds.
It is a number isn't it.
A few of them even.
It's more numbers than my click damage.
Rela winners invest in excessive amount of farming equipment.
Aye armor and afk damage.
Thats what I always go for.
Click damage 170. auto click 6044k.
Havent gotten enough dosh.
Mostly because I keep dying anyway because of the level disparity.
I joined a game that was level 300 and spent half an hour dead but just buy armor until you stop being dead and you're good.
Why is it that i can never get my fucking spawn cripplers to work.
Takes literally forever to get one of those to actually do something.
Noelor I am binning your japanese DTK pack.
But u still da bes'.
So long as I am.
Fossilised remains of a new bat species which lived 16 million years ago walked on four limbs and was three times larger than today's average bat have been discovered in New Zealand.
Oh crap. The Pleiades just broke Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
Dammit guys stop breaking things.
This is why we can't have nice theorems.
ChaosSmurf So apparently one of the guys in my SR group is going nuts over this.
*SR group who plays MtG.
But not very good.
So the commission that my SR GM did of the current campaign BBEG got finished.
Looks like a fun chap.
Who'da thunk Tavern Brawl would be fun.
Though Nefarian seems a bit on the favoured side.
I think the whole internet agrees.
Elders bless our glorious cyberpunk futu- uh present.
That website is agressively generic.
All part of the plan.
The fact a company could unironically have that name though.
Kirisu the figured they needed SOMETHING to make them rise above the rest of the world.
And since it wasn't going to be their website.
Might as well be th ename.
It's a decent strategy.
Moan about house prices then put up your house for 10% more than what ou paid for it.
Also public transport but otherwise spot on.
Until no one can afford them!
Then get the goverment to subsidise buying a house.
Gee sounds like Stockholm to me v.
So poeple can afford them again.
Anathema less details procedural rather than stored images/music much much simpler and repetitive gameplay.
There i just save dyou reading an article.
We were randomly permuting C code into semantically identical but syntactically different manifestations to get the compiler to produce code that was 200 125 50 then 8 bytes smaller.
MoonWolf The PS1 had 2MB of RAM and we had to do crazy things to get the game to fit. We had levels with over 10MB of data in them.
Okay its a less dumb article than i expected.
Ultimately Crash fit into the PS1's memory with 4 bytes to spare. Yes 4 bytes out of 2097152. Good times.
This level has a bug.
We won't fix it because we can't load it if we do.
Cooked_Auto someone is incredibly aroused by this.
I'd love to see a Swedish version of that.
Cooked_Auto good news there's a rape center for men in sweden now we'll need it after eds visit.
Yay I remembered my steam password.
Obviously. I'll call in ahead then and tell them to prep for our arrival on the 1st.
Anyone heard anything about Shadowrun Chronciles?
Other than the developers conking? No not really.
I think the SRR games are a bitter investment anyway.
Yeah but I own all of them already!
Well good then you're set.
MoonWolf open your browser console and do `16 == 16`.
Those are NOT equal.
I have some Red Bull because I slept I think 3 hours last night.
Thats not enough hours.
Appreciated worldwide by top athletes students and in highly demanding professions as well as during long drives.
If it weren't for athletes I think it would be the most honest advertising text I've ever seen.
Its not wrong its embellishing a bit though.
Apreciated world wide by people who really need some caffiene now.
Red Bull - you know why you're drinking this and it isn't for your health.
Red Bull - a chemical punch to the heart.
At work I hang my keys on one on my monitors' power cables.
So occasionally I accidentally unplug it and get confused.
I'll do an easy cosplay someone who just wears normal clothes I said.
So now I'm trying to buy a faux-fur coonskin cap online.
With the tail? I think theres a specific name for those.
On account of being the skin of a coon.
Only I don't want a dead animal on my head.
Oh I was thinking of Davy Crockett.
He being a famous apocryphal? person who wore one.
No Davy Crockett is a real historical person in this case who was involved in the Battle of the Alamo.
The whole cap thing was a later addition afaik thanks to Disney in the 50'.
So it being his hat is apocryphal.
An old guy didn't wear the hat people think he did.
My whole life is a lie.
I will never trust another human being again.
Writing rpg murder mysteries is hard.
Its actually really easy.
You kill an npc.
And then after the players have faffed about for 2 sessions you pick whoever they decided on as the one who did it.
These are true facts about lfg.
There is a new class in the ffxiv expansion that tanks with greatswords.
Like a death knight?
Like a ?
I actually really dig that aesthetic too though.
Yeah but in a fun game V.
Oh sweet my Mad Max shirt arrived.
Not sure that needed to be put as a flawed quantum physics reference.
Could have just said it's a cat in a clear box.
I don't make the titles.
Internet loves cats in boxes anyway.
I jus tpost pictures of cats to irc.
And for this your life is judged that little more important.
So cats are the anti-life equation?
Or part of the anti-life equation.
Wakfu is getting a third season.
Some of you regular ff14 playing weaboos might like reading this.
Cool and all but don't think I'll ever make an au'ra myself.
Hard enough levelling 1 character.
Aaw 900 more levels to 20k.
Not going to make it I think.
Kaunmoth tell us your badge points when the new game goe sup.
The level time is going to minus because it doesn't load the monsters before they're dead.
Yeah I had one of those games a day ago or so.
This game has serious lag issues.
Right now mine is just at lvl687.
Which is annoying because the only time you really tend to play it is when you start.
When th elag is the worst.
MoonWolf yeah yesterday I spent 30-45 minutes dead from the level I was on or lag and it didn't count money properly.
This is a thing.
Guy goes to r/legaladvnice to ask what to do now that he's set up a company wide email to install a virus on every computer in an office building.
After breaking into it.
I assume the short answer is yes while the long answer is yes you fucking moron.
Not only is the awnser yes.
The awnser is yes and also welcome to pounded-in-the-ass-jail.
I didn't steal from the cash register it was open and therefor I was allowed to take it.
It has to be a troll no one can be that stupid.
Kaunmoth but if its a troll why is it so obviously wrong.
You're not going to get a funny reaction out of that one.
Its just yeah you're a criminal and you're going to jail. get a laywer i guess.
Start from this and scroll down for something amazing.
470 levels to 20k.
Oh Cooked_Auto did T or ed tell you where the house is?
Yeah I got the email.
I take it the other one also fell through.
Kaunmoth We should probably look into getting a Stockholm card.
Only lasts 5 days max though.
Then again that should be plenty.
Get it on thursday or friday then they might be pooped when they get there have a chill day of wandering a bit and then set out for attractions.
Tbh get ed into sf bookstore and that's most of the day gone.
Kaunmoth but waht if half the books are swedish ?
150 levels to go.
I just know the Lego Portal stuff is going to sell like hotcakes.
Game is over level 19897.
Taco drone!
Okay... so the monster game reset.
And in 6 mins I'm at level 1000.
I think I'm in one of those record breaker rooms by accident V.
I was at level 19890 so.
I only got 465 points.
But now I can apparently upgrades in stacks of 10.
Mairnai at lot of wormhole spam.
So far this sale has not enticed me to buy anything.
Its impressive in a way.
I got a couple of friends to get Endless Legend.
One of them didn't realise it was not a steamplay though so might have to return it if they can't find a windows thing for their linux.
That anime thing otoh.
I have no idea what to do with.
Watch_Dogs episode 8 in which Ironicus finally gets to gush about Chicago positively.
Noelor it will be the last time.
Watch_Dogs is Chip's 28th LP.
According to the numbering on his YouTube channel.
Well chip is a fairly organized man.
So that sounds legit.
Plus they have done a LOT of lps.
Yeah it includes all the wee stuff like You Testament and DD.
Holy shit the game Im in is at lvl 22061 v.
Got 129B in gold.
Here i thought almost being level 1000 by now was fast.
My abilitybar is kinda jampacked like 55 pumped ups.
New word of the day retrodict.
Prediction but of the past.
So not a prediction then.
But making a statement about an unkown event.
Yay brain scoop update.
>check facebook briefly before bed.
>2nd status is my ex changing her profile picture being like by a mutual Friend.
You sure know how to lull me to sleep.
Which ex was it?
The one that matters.
I'm buying a hat now.
Hmm can't quite interpret 'mattering' I assume the more recent one then?
Ugh this hat-buying is annoyingly difficult.
I think I'm just going to get this one.
Because I can't find any actual faux-fur hatters online in this country.
Hatters gonna hat ?
I should bake this weekend.
Suggest me a thing to bake!
We should all bake this weekend.
But what are we baking.
Everyone should bake every weekend.
Except now I think about it I shouldn't.
I made oatmeal cookies two weeks ago.
No much of a Baker tbh.
Idk something with ginger that's nice in cakes.
I don't know I'm allergic to most cakes.
I shouldn't cook because it's ramadan and taunting the muslims in the office with delicious baked goods would be in very poor taste.
Make something without gluten MoonWolf.
But I imagine they are sensible people and wouldnt be too offended by that.
Just to show off.
Cooked_Auto *I'd* feel bad though.
Noelor they're allowed to eat after sunset though right?
So bring enough to take home to nibble.
Kaunmoth yes but that is like.
Hey a cookie is a cookie even at 10.
I make a great lime pie.
But gluten none for you.
I mean I shouldn't really eat kladdkaka and yet I do whenever give the chance to.
Noelor bake on damn i don't know the english name for the end of ramadan feast.
Its suiker feest in dutch.
Kaunmoth according to wiki Chocolate Mud Cake.
We just use the uh... let's say it's the arabic word.
That's what I'm thinking.
Oh hey that actually lines up pretty well with the other upcoming occassion I could bake for.
I love suiker feest as a name.
Because its just so damn honest.
Hm always thought it was fudge cake.
Which is board games for pensioners at my place.
Edi It's pretty easy to do so we could make that next week.
MoonWolf it's p great yeah.
If vetekatten is still in stockholm we're going there Cooked_Auto and Edilith.
They make glutenfree cakes.
But... for dutch muslims I guess.
Kaunmoth Alright. I'm game.
So not mardi gras at all then.
Similar in goal I feel.
Have a party eat all the carbs enter food coma.
Kaunmoth You are in luck!
Thing I learned this week the start of ramadan and presumably every other month in the muslim calendar is based on the observation of the crescent moon.
By... some imam I guess it was a brief wikipediaing.
They do like cresent moons.
So one colleague started last night I think based on an observation in Mecca.
But another is starting tonight based on I guess local observations?
Is it literally have to see the moon ?
This led to mass confusion among all the white people around us.
The article said observe.
Like it was cloudy last night.
Guess i get a day reprive.
I just know that the guy came in late and didn't eat or drink but the lass behind me had soup and coffee and said she'd start tonight.
Health comes beforehand though so they can make it up later.
And then like I said all the english people got confused and wondered how the moon even worked when you get down to it.
I worked in a greenhouse and my dad owned one.
Women on their period aren't allowed to fast iirc.
And on hot days it was basically juts fucking get something in you because fuck that noise.
If we're in the middle of summer and are working on a tropical weather schedual.
I didn't know until last year that muslim fasting included not drinking.
When I worked in a restaurant we had a muslim guy that passed out due to not eating and not drinking enough water.
Because christians who fast still drink.
Last year the guy on my team got kidney stones while fasting because it was in August!
He was given a forced holiday until the end by the boss because fuck it the kitchen is 45 degrees and you're working nonstop for 10 hours.
And y'know only drinking during 2-3 hours out of each 24.
Turns out not great.
The thing with all this.
Is as we discovered when this colleague came back from hospital the imam will just tell you don't be dumb be healthy and maybe do it later.
Aye health comes beforehand.
So and I say this as a person basically incapable of religion you should really just ask.
Yeah iman's are surprisingly sensible.
And not be dumb about it.
Don't kill yourself with it.
Anyway now I've bought a probably rubbish but it's okay I'm probably only wearing it once or twice hat and talked about religion.
I was in Egypt over Ramadan in August one year.
So many of them got pissed off at the drop of a hat.
Oh you westerners wanna visit our museum? sorry it's 2pm I haven't eaten since 5am was up all night having a post-fasting all you can eat and really cba manning these artifacts anymore.
Old co-worker contacted me going hey you remember when you showed me how to make the old mac pros accept most graphics card to run 64 bit and maverick?
I sense something amazing in the works here.
Edilith so what and how are you doing in sweden anyway? Assuming I can somehow even get there will I have to worry about hotels as well?
Nah we're renting a place.
Slightly outside the city but its been booked until the 1st and it's just gonna be us. And a cat.
How much will getting there by bus cost?
It's about 5â‚¬ by train from stockholm central.
And there's a spare bedroom.
Well no promises but I will see what I can do.
Well if you can come plans are flexible for the days and there's a house already booked with a spare room for you GlennCuttlefish.
Well yes at this point the problem is finding the money.
I was planning on calling my folks and see if they were willing to sponsor my trip. My pitch was something like.
Spying on the Swedes?
Hey want to donate 70-100e and send me to sweden? BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! If you donate only half I will not be coming back.
Sponsor now and I will punch one from the sissy island in the arm for free! AND! He's ginger!
Also basically british at this point.
So thats like a double nationality punch right there.
Well almost triple 4 years in Wales and 3 years in England.
We dont really consider Ã¥landers sissies we just wish they would fuck off to sweden. but leave us the tax loop holes for cheap imports please.
I'll stay finnish then but I too wish this island would just pick a fucking sidelololol swedes and fucking be done with it.
And that sweet tax-free sea is just costing the island money.
Not for the island.
The ship flag swedish finnish or estonia tallin latvia even.
But the island taxes all go to mainland and then we get a percentage back from mainland which is always more than we gave them so the politicians build bullshit to justify the budget to keep getting their percentage.
MoonWolf Opponent Nefarian called 8 whelps.
Following turn wild magic gave him bloodlust.
< brawl sound fun.
It allows for absolutely batshit crazy stuff too x3.
I installed hearthstone on ubuntu and it runs albeit with fucked audio but I don't know how it runs vs someone else also im shit at it.
But I'm level 64390 on steam monster so I have that going for me.
Body please why are you making me hurt all fo the sudden.
Have I offended you somehow?
S'alright kaunmoth I'm shit at hearthstone too.
Dont you love the feeling of spending skillpoints on something that seems awesome but that doesn't actually work.
No i don't love that.
Damn Finland I tried a proper sauna yesterday and now I want more.
This dude in the Widowmaker video can fucking aim.
ChaosSmurf well you'd have to be able too.
Okay he got worse as he went.
He rifle definitely charges too fast to too much damage.
Watching the winston video right now.
That lighting gun is really hard to judge the range on from his perspective.
Yeah it's really bad.
They've already updated it.
Check this thread.
Yeah that is much better.
Also for once a defending team actually brought a bastion.
And he looks pretty good once he actually gets to do his thing.
I really like his turn into a tank move 3.
MairBear i need to spectate you!
ChaosSmurf oh man i didn't realize you could use your grapple as a short range boost.
That is a bad shredder draw.
Thaurissan will be good to hav estick tough.
Why didn't you flamecannon for 4 procs of flamewalker ?
If vanish she dies if healbot she dies.
Aaand 135 d ust.
At least it froze in a semi amusing pose this time.
<- t his is cool.
Aaand now I have the transformation music off Sailor Moon Crystal looping through my head.
Try thanking him in a place he can see.
I just wanted to put it in your head too.
Sorry it didn't work.
Cooked_Auto what secret world server are you on just for the sake of potential stalking v.
Doesnt matter but I think its one of the RP realms Arcadia or something.
Im pretty sure I can just switch to your instance if we ever play so.
I think we were on different realms with C_A so it should be fine.
You know if you wanted to play TSW you could've asked me as Ive got a free code for one copy of the game from buying ultimate edition.
7425 badge points v.
The game has just started and is already on lvl 3875.
People are wormholing like crazy.
I'd like to have your damn luck when it comes to games.
It says no one I know is playing C.
Forget what I said lvl 4892.
Also I think CA and I were in the same game yesterday V.
I think it was time for the rest.
Cos I am also at 7428.
Haha so much bossloot that the text scrolled past the screen.
...it just fucking leaped to lvl 15721.
Its pretty much skipping 100-200 levels just from all the wormhole spam.
Which was my previous game.
Fire Emblem Fates sees the return of marriage and kids | VG247 <- yay~.
Oh Talisman is on a big sale now o.
Oh my a bowl of strawberries all for me.
Is that... good for you?
Probably not but its midsummer so.
But is it BAD for you ?
Everybody else has cake so.
No plans to this week.
He's got diabetes not spontaneous sugar poisoning.
Those are basically the same thing.
Unrelated I just got back from my first ever flat viewing!
It was a pretty nice flat!
My mother has councilled that I must view some more before making a decision though.
This is a good idea.
Your mother is wise and sensible.
This is why I have enlisted her help on this flat-buying endeavour.
So apparently there is one tiny tiny thing missing from the DLC pack of Talismans. And all the negative reviews are games okay but this is some shady shit they promised us ALL the things.
You can't un-thing a pack of things.
The tiny thing is a character that they sell to raise money for charity and allegedly give 100% of it straight to the charity v.
All these mad people getting mad over shady stuff... when at least on paper it's a pretty decent motive.
Deep like an ocean.
Something something dark side.
Is anyone on mumble?
I could be on mumble.
Oh that's a thing.
Noelor y u leave ?
For some reason my mic is not being picked up.
I can hear you fine moonwolf.
Will need toplay this when I am sober.
Why would anyone want that.
17b gold and the lvl is 1017220.
Yoko taro claims there is a happy ending for Nier 2 the other staff there disagree.
Fucking hell lvl 1158146.
Yessss. someone linked this.
...what the fuck was that.
So I am playing witcher 3 right in some low level area thats just full of level 3 cannibals.
I pick up this letter on some corpse the moment I finish reading it a hag appears out of nowhere and one shots me.
Didnt even get to see its level but it had to be high.
Well now I did see it. Its ??
That means its high!
I wish there was a clear indicator on when my buffs are about to run out.
Because for some reason there is no timer on my shield. Which means I just got one shot again since it expired on the last second.
Because no I wont skip this damned ?? hag A.
Okay blocking bad idea. oneshot through my block as well.
No but Kojima did say he always wanted to do a story about the Boss fighting Nazis. Imagine that for a second. Hideo Kojima... doing Wolfenstein... with a female lead.
Metal Gear Eagle Killer.
!note ChaosSmurf you might enjoy this talk.
<- my brain refuses to accept that this is not a bath.
When you die in No Man's Sky a Call of Duty-style motivational quote will pop up on screen. We've now learned that in addition to quotes from science-fiction writers and philosophers the ambitious PlayStation 4 and PC game will present players with motivational quotes from...Jaden Smith.
Note to self Never piss off wyverns in this game again.
Cooked_Auto we'll that's a good incentive to not die.
Okay seriously this is ridiculous.
So far on my journey to escape from this goddamn murder plane I have waded my way through a swamp climbed over a mountain and swam across the sea/lake.
And its still following me.
Wyvern found on the green waymarker south of me.
Its still after me.
SIR YOU ARE BEING HUNTED.
GlennCuttlefish you came to the wrong neighboorhood.
Well since it wont stop following me my new goal is to make it to the other end of the map that still has the point visible.
Which might not be easy since that thing will kill me in one hit.
It's just around the corner don't blink don't look away.
SunTiger do you have a good kat proxy.
Or is your government not evil.
ChaosSmurf my goverment is not evil.
They blocked kat.cr after a few months.
We had a single court order to block piratebay.
But a number of isps came out a year later with statistics that proved it did absolutly nothing.
And it was overturned.
Britain is a fucking dystopia.
ChaosSmurf I am in Milngavie again you free tonight?
Nah I'm still unpacking.
What are you a jpeg decoder on an 8068?
Don't quit your day job.
The entire left side of my body is also fucking killing me.
Lifting things + new bed I assume.
How disappointing my entire holiday is ruined.
Are you going away tomorrow.
Looks like my internet caps out at abou 10 meg a second.
Oh no it got up to 13 for a second there.
We can do tomorrow.
Perhaps fathers day + sunday family dinner so evening may be tied up.
But I gotta work from 6 til 7 at least.
What's the joke with that.
Did they make it easier to progress or.
I noticed some people were on level 100 million.
Yeah progress has been sped up by now.
Grmbl first mosquito bite of the summer.
You can bonuses in packs of 100 and even the loading screen goes to 109.
Pretty sure they've added several upgrade levels too but I cant say for sure.
Alright got a laptop setup for Stockholm. only problem is that the battery is not detected/working so it has to run on powersupply or else it will go boop.
Oh huzzah pigeon dating sim on flash sale.
Glenny will we see you?
In 3D I mean not see you over the interwebs.
Still a mystery. I havent been able to contact my folks yet. Should be able to do it by tomorrow evening.
Well no pressure but we would love to see you and pretty sure we have space for you to crash. The add.
Oops. The ad for the house said there are two spare beds but if nothing ride we can offer a big sofa*.
RIDE? I mean nothing else.. Sorry I'm on mobile not drunk.
Kaunmoth might offer you a ride of some kind no guarantees.
Only half four in the afternoon.
I know it's a saturday but I'd be impressed if you were drnuk.
Midsummer was yesterday anyway.
C_A let's learn that second one before I leave your country.
I'm not drink but may or may not be drnuk.
Saw that movie last night.
ChaosSmurf ok well text me or w/e if you can make it to Milngavie I will either provide taxi fare home or a place to crash in return for not being willing to go into Glasgow >_>.
Hanging out on mumble if anyone cares.
There there I care.
Might hop on in a bit.
Oh cool my hat arrived today.
Noelor that was fast.
1640 <- this looks like a great Tales installment.
Tales of clapping games.
SunTiger yay library cakes.
Its a decent tales game. The writing is dumb combat is good.
Also fuck that guy. He is the worst thing ever.
That that stuff was missing from 4 continues to be the greatest shame in that game.
MairBear come hang out with us on the mumbles.
I'm proud of some clickbait I wrote.
ChaosSmurf kill you are self.
Writing clickbait? Well you are a real videogame journalist now.
They grow up so fast '.
This sure is a Mastodon video.
ChaosSmurf you do what you gotta do to put food on the tale.
Cooked_Auto>> pterodactyl sabertooth tiger triceratops tyrannosaurus?
You said mastodon I was finishing the power rangers chant.
You forgot the dragon.
Watching Psycho-Pass. well ofc the protag is reading Heart of Darkness.
Lol random beat hazard booster pack.
They heard you slagging off the competition.
ChaosSmurf is creating some wonderful out-of-context quotes.
Can I do anything disgusting to him now?
How are you finding beyond earth.
I played one game of it and was like that's plenty.
I now wish revengeance had mods so I could make this the music.
I wish I could get out of this town in witcher 3.
Its eating up all of my ram all of the time.
I have some DDR2 you can sacrifice to the rammster monster.
Got 2gb of DDR2 memory that I cant use you can have or have you gone over to a DDR3 machine?
Huh I made a pretty decent bit of steam wallet money for the sale almost a full euro just from selling spare cards.
And in a real ruccenry?
In real money? Jack shit p.
Buy some zimbabwe dollars before they're all destroyed/sold on ebay.
Then you can always say that you have a trillion dollars.
A bit of a coincidence.
That every single old WOW CM.
Doesn't currently have a job listed on LinkedIn a twitter account or according to the internet actually still exist.
All the interesting ones.
I can't even find Corelei's real name in the credits for the game.
Eyonix's name is Chad Jones but doesn't seem to have been employed since 2013.
And Tseric who I'm actually trying to get into contact with is also impossible.
Maybe Blizz paid them enough to play gofd for the rest of their lives?
May have been looking in the wrong place for Corelei actually.
Be paid minimum wage to be yelled at and insulted by angry teenagers pretty shit job.
I think you may have.
Made an error here somewhere.
What would you put forum moderator under in official credits.
That wasn't community manager.
Perhaps but I'm still guessing not a whole lot.
I don't know that I would.
Anathema the requirements for the job are 5 years experience and a degree.
They're not actually responsible for making any part of the game are they?
True but the CMs are in there.
How do they justify asking for a degree for *CM*?
Well it's an organisation and communication role.
And for some reason people think you're better at that if you have a qualification in it.
I guess the scale of it maybe.
I guess when some of these guys were hired in 2004 probably not so much.
Likely still needed experience or relevant education though.
You need to be enbitterned already to become a CM.
There's a reason blizzard's open jobs page is like 150 open positions 50 of which are marked as vital.
And it's not just because Riot steals all of their employees.
ChaosSmurf how do you even get experience in CM'ing.
Not exactly a large market.
You go be a CM at another company I would assume.
Also y'know there's the old fall-back of having any degree at all translating as has their shit together.
That means anything you can say hey this is like that job.
I.e. being a forum moderator on a relatively large site.
ChaosSmurf has plenty of cm exprience.
Just look at his tweet backlog.
I applied to work in an accounts office with experience of washing dishes.
Man I forgot Paul Sams had quit.
You can bs a lot of life skills or whatever from... basically any job.
Anyway this seems to be more dead ends.
ChaosSmurf chefs require a fuckload of experience and aren't paid terribly great either!
I think our definitions of terribly great and minimum wage may vary P.
You either study cooking for a great number of years to be allowed to do the simplest things in a nice kitchen for fuck all money for even more years or you start as the dishboy or runner and hope you can prove that you're not a retard.
Also while kitchens on the whole are not being run by tv show idiots they are high stress.
Like you better love cooking a lot.
If you want to do it for that.
If you value your hands sanity and health then never work in a kitchen.
Man even the fuckers that are still there are difficult to track down an actual contact for.
I bet Medievaldragon could get this done.
I am finding some pretty great 8 year old drama.
Man he baited the trolls so fucking much.
Or perhaps got baited.
Replied to a lot of shit people just never do any more.
Oh man I just realized I didnt even have a proper midsummers meal.
Have to remedy this today by eating...Herring.
ChaosSmurf hey if you were a CM or high visible Developer for a game like WoW.
You'd minize your contact information EVERYWHERE.
But these older guys don't even have twitter.
You saw that and thought of me.
Every journo I know even with gamergate running rampant has an e-mail address available pretty easily.
What exactly are you planning in Stockholm?!
He's going to marry you to a duck.
At least it'll be an exotic Swedish duck with a sexy accent.
Wonder if I should bother shaving or not for next week p.
The duck equivalent duckquivalent of MaÌŠns ZelmerloÌˆw?
Im just going assume you cheated with that.
GODDAMNIT DANDELION WHY CANT YOU BEHAVE FOR ONCE.
I pull it up on YouTube every time yeah =P.
Fuck this. I'm going back to gwent.
GlennCuttlefish because he's a fop.
I trust Dandelion more than anyone else -GlennCuttlefish 2015.
I know he will not betray me. I also know he will probably get himself killed.
For a good while I had trouble finding quests of my level.
Now I am outleveling all my sidequests.
These main ones give too much XP.
Dandelion is one of Geralts few proper friends afaik.
I am into the part of the internet that created spin-off forums from the WoW off-topic board.
Our new range of long line t-shirts are a must-have item for anyone looking to get up to date with the oversize trend.
I mean to me this has stopped being a t-shirt and started being a dress.
Well the world is trending fatter right?
It must be a planned trend. v.
Yeah I agree that is not a shirt anymore.
Such a lovely dress.
I mean I'm not mad if Topman want to sell me some sort of tunic-dress I'm on board with that.
Yeah thats a shirtdress or something. Pretty sure there is a term for it already or something >_>.
Just needs some accessorising and a vest because that picture does not show how thin the material is.
See my vest see my vest made from real gorilla chest.
No the British English vest.
I have plenty of American English vests none made from gorillae afaik.
When I go to work I wear a waistcoat but not a vest.
If I were American I'd be wearing a vest and not a tank top.
What's a wifebeater then?
Usually made of fishnet.
Oh god. I've just discovered Soundclouds Shadowrun category. D I only got 124gigs left on my music drive. I shouldnt download more.
Mr Burns sang about a waistcoat/vest.
But this is pretty good.
I'll stick to my 30 or so shirts.
I have strayed into such a very dark part of the internet and I desperately want to leave.
Now I am in a thread titled Social Justice in the Open Source Community.
Yeah you're not getting any pity from me.
Why are you doing this to yourself.
To write a good article.
Art can only come from pain pain comes from social justice in the open source community this is my mission I must expose myself I must become pain to write good I must feel bad.
It's getting better.
I am on to reading IRC logs from 2007.
At least he hasnt started wallraffing.
Are there any internet archiving services that are more thorough than way back machine.
You were always in #wowhead right.
ALL MY WORK FOR NOUGHT.
If you need wowhead logs you could ask tecnobrat.
Don't know if he has them.
But its my best option.
Just trying to track down some guy called Kirkburn.
But not enough to actually google search for him.
This would be a lot easier.
If every forum on the planet hadn't had server issues between 2007 and now.
Or just closed down.
A man couldn't hide his tracks this well deliberately lucky bastard.
Kirkburn sounds like a train station in Scotland.
She was in the credits and under community management.
I was just thrown by her being in the credits for games after she left the company too.
So i'm watching esl frankfurt.
And they are showing the production room.
Lots of screens with cameras and ingame views.
And the guy is being all serious and shush and hyping how important it all is and what not.
And there is just someone playing agario on some massive fucking monitor and 3 people standing aroun dit.
Undermining his whole spiel.
Wish i'd seen it.
I have to wash some socks for the first time in like 3 months.
SunTiger wow that retimer.
Guess i'll go peel some potatoes.
I should get a buzzcut to really piss of ed.
But I'd probably end up with a broken arm.
Oh no an invasion of Ediliths.
Edilith3 was best Edilith.
We will forever mourn.
Gone but not forgotten.
Always in our hearts.
Well I might actually possibly with any luck be able to afford the trip. I have to doublecheck prices availability of tickets and stuff tomorrow when I actually get the money.
Plsea tup em bakc ropper.
Cant. too full from bbq.
So I am messing around with console commands in witcher 3 because I am tired of running around this RAM hogging city.
And I use the fast travel command.
I teleport away sure but I spawn in middle of nowhere 50 meters in the air.
You die from a fall of about twice your height in this game.
That's what you get for haxxing.
You know what else is nice about cheating?
God mode. Good thing I type fast.
Aw yeah main theme intensifying in Fate.
So hatoful lets you set the language to japanese albeit w/o subs goty right there.
This week in JoJo a creepy perv orangutan.
Wait no one has actually played the Space Jam track on Audiosurf? /.
Noelor is that better or worse than the dog ?
The dog from right at the beginning?
Cooked_Auto more like the version you have if it's anything like AS1.
Turns out most of them were in the mono mode and not casual.
Prefer casual mostly because its comfy.
Well as comfy as a all red downhil track can be.
Does as2 still have vegas?
Jolly good rather fond of tht ship.
Noelor catching up on fts.
Lol rin asking saber for permission.
That is... a ever ydifferent look for the grail.
Okay the grail definitly didn't do that.
It got a lot of new tricks.
Yeah like that had.
An there we go.
Enuma elish is ON THE FIELD.
Get fucked whatever Gil's looking at.
Assassin calls saber some kind of lion.
Yeah I liked that.
Infinite blade swords intensifies.
Well he turned one mountain into two mountains.
Still taller than one floor!
AN AFRONT TO GOD!
Noelor True Endings are the fucking worst.
This hots tourney with an advance run to blizzcon.
Running a convoluted elimination bracket to the point that they should just run round robin.
BwaS whats convoluted about it ?
They started as 8 teams playing 'quarter finals'.
Losers then make a lower tier elimination.
Any losers from the progressive upper elimination drop down to the lower tier to face winning progressing initial losers.
Thats all pretty standard losers bracket stuff.
I'm sure it is.
Cooked_Auto What's the name of that comic?
That's the first issue of the new Runaways comic.
Marvel in this case.
Here's a storytime of the issue even.
Does have Molly being... Molly.
That comment is more relevant if you've read older runaways and such.
Tales of X trailer.
I should get a PS3 again and mod it.
She looks like she pissed herself < poor samus splatoon.
Hey you bottybot how do I make this note to ed.
!note KaunMoth like this!
If you're lucky the image might stay up until she gets back.
If not I know Ive got it saved p.
I saved it as well.
It shall haunt her.
Must resist humming this next week p.
Nah Cooked_Auto whenever someone is unable to pronounce the U in Euro.
<- this is a fucking d2 mod.
I don't even KNOW how.
I think witcher 3 is telling me to take a break again.
It locked me inside a house.
It's your timeout for past cheating.
Wait no it wasn't locked.
It was just one of those breakable doors that you have to..well break.
But I walked in without any problems.
This game acts weird when you are running low on memory.
Not as much forgets as doesn't load them in time.
Pretty sure I ran through a locked door yesterday as well fortunately I was able to talk it open.
If you're still on DDR2 Ive got 2gigs of RAM you can have.
Anyone interested in playing the WoW patch this week.
Enjoy your fun without me.
You know I can't do that.
You are the avatar of fun.
I'm sure GlennCuttlefish can support me on that.
See. Even he agrees.
They emanate like sentient goo seeking caffeine and rum with the occasional blop sound on the floor as you accidentally step next to a puddle of glennthoughts.
This got surreal quickly.
GlennCuttlefish you are also a noob now aren't y ou.
A noob you say?
How do you mean?
Not playing wow at the moment. Not planning on playing wow in the near future.
Well at least this piece won't be strip club effect'd.
It's where you do something as part of a group/pairing and find it very fun without realising the reason it's fun is that you're in that group/pairing.
Like mass suicide or going to strip clubs.
For the piece anyway.
Mass suicides are fun in a group -ChaosSmurf 2015.
KaunMoth I guess we're going to a strip club next week P.
I have the internet why would I pay to see scantly dressed women and feel bad about myself.
Because your friends are coming with you!
Hence the name of the phenomena.
GlennCuttlefish it's my go to line when people say a co-op game is fun with friends.
But I don't get to use it anywhere because everyone would be mad.
It's either that or mass suicide.
Can't we you know take a shit in ikea instead?
How about bike a bus in a bathtub?
Don't worry my family has weird idioms.
I worry for your family.
I would too but half of it is dead and the other half insane the rest aren't talking to each other.
Sounds like a lovely situation.
Man I cant decide what to do with lunch.
But what should I eat.
Its either going to be safe and boring frieds eggs and potatoes or some kind of wild and zany halloumi experiment.
Well I do but I am making curry out of it later. possibly tomorrow.
Not sure I have the makings for a really good halloumi salad. guess I could try some kind of caesar halloumi salad.
...except I dont have bread to make croutons.
Bread is solid beer thus bread is good.
Beer is tasty poison.
In fact I dont have parmesan either.
Guess i'll just make something out of pasta halloumi and whatever vegetables I can find.
Mm grilled halloumi is nice though.
Use halloumi instead of crutons and substitute parmesan with halloumi.
Just eat nohting but halloumi ?
My brother just makes halloumi burgers.
Today's lunch peanut butter pretzel sticks.
The pretzels were going to be breakfast but I wasn't hungry and it's too rainy to go get a lunch.
Minister that isn't halloumi so i'm pretty certain KaunMoth does not aprove.
Your lack of halloumi disappoints me.
I only had what I had.
Hm. too much pasta. otherwise turned out pretty good.
Fried some spring onions and zucchini added tomato some kind of leafy salad thing cucumber macaroni and the halloumi.
GlennCuttlefish sounds like a lot of things that are not halloumi in with your halloumi.
Hiding the halloumi to make the experience and subsequent enjoyment of finding halloumi that much more nicer like a short little nutritious sidequest of nommables and cheese.
Okay yes entirely too much pasta.
I'm full and theres still half left.
<- the best dad.
In this episode of crying robots creepy stalking of a main character.
Can you guess which one.
Sir you are being hunted?
Wonder if this series will turn good again. First episode was so good rest..not so much. I am hoping for some pathetic weeping come final episode however.
I swear to gods this series better not get a happy ending.
He will punch you into dust if you disagree.
Ember / Minister.
Havent you posted that before..Or do all pictures of that character now blend together in my head.
Good god they might be getting closer to explaining the thing that bothers me most about the plot in this.
That would imply he has some sanity left from being around us being around his friends and being finnish.
Highly professional sexual harassment.
Main character in How I met your mother.
I swear to gods this series better not get a happy ending <- this is why you never get nice things.
Look I started watching this because the first episode had not only one but two families being ripped apart.
Ripped? torn? torn might be more accurate but you get what I mean.
This series was sold on the idea of hey what if you had human shaped sapient pets who lived for 10 years and then had to be put down.
2 episodes to go the way this one ended it could go either way.
Well it took a long time for this series to get into serious spaghetti.
Aaah noo lmms i didn't mean to click on you.
Stop... taking.. all resources.
Waaaaiiit a minute this series is 13 episodes?
Is that a... problem?
And its not really a problem just kind of ruined my plan of marathoning the rest of the series.
Since only 12 episodes are out now.
I still think this series would have been better if they had focused on the retrievals instead of this romance stuff.
Yeah its a rare case these days if a series stretches into 24 episodes tbh.
Or it can go the way of The Amazing Screw-on head which had one episode the pilot <.
The search for fsteak.
We'll never have fsteak.
Goal for today Order the most mundane menu item whenever I stop to eat for lunch today in town and proclaim it toothsome and unctuous.*.
* Try not to stop at the same fast food joint you ordered your meal emulating Ryo Hazuki's speaking mannerisms the other day.
Exalted ended early by a rash of bad internet connections.
But at least it actually happened this week!
I got a magical wristband that tracks my heartrate and jazz at the airport.
They want to know your secrets.
They want to know what jazz you listen too.
Jokes on them then I don't even listen to jazz!
Soon you will feel a huge hankering for jazz.
Jazz is only good as a noir soundtrack.
Man I really need to order a new 1TB harddrive so I can actually download more of the Shadowrun music from Soundcloud >_>.
I need to get a bigger HD so i can have more shadowrun music!
SunTiger My music harddrive only has 110gb left sooo.
You have a problem.
I think I have like 2 or 3TB in externals. I meant internal anyway.
Does he have the solution?!
No I have a solution Cooked_Auto has a problem.
To be honest most of my externals are just drives with caddies.
Half of them have been internal.
I have a box filled with old drives that I can use because they're all IDEs.
KaunMoth at that point you might as well start mirroring drives to get some fail protection.
Anathema I do that as well.
Midnight snack steak with apple salsa and garlic dressing.
...I just have two sandwhiches.
Oh fuck off game.
Next week is going to be weird.
So I am fighting this damn supergriffin thing that takes a whole lot of damage to kill and kills me in two hits.
At one point in my fight it just flew away long enough for me to save the game since I figured why not.
I load that game and what happens? ITS ON FULL HEALTH AGAIN.
Stab it in the face with a console command?
Yeah I'll probably back this.
Earned victory. did it the way I do everything else in this instead of the thing that designes probably hoped for.
You can probably make one rather easily Noelor.
My method for everything is just to activate the shield and start swinging.
Probably if I could sew at all yeah.
'tis not hard once you start.
And that is 3 pieces of cloth with stuffing inside.
One of my ears is blocked it is very disconcerting.
According to my magic spy band my sleep last night was 'optimal'.
Welp Hannibal has been cancelled.
There's no convention for separation of digits in binary is there?
It's not like 1001100011 or w/e.
If seperation is needed for display it is done based on context.
If its not displayed for a user its just never seperated.
Man my track record of killing succubi in this game is horrible.
Cooked I'll be in Stockholm at about 1030 tomorrow.
Yeah I wont be there until 1430 my train leaves Alvesta station at 1051.
Moth You think Edi would want to read Sunstone or not?
Not sure what she reads nowadays.
Eh I got bagspace so.
I need to consider packing soon I suppose.
I packed yesterday v.
Was bored had the bag so I thought why the hell not.
Granted I didn't pack precisely everything and I need to throw in some bedsheets and such just in case.
I was digging through bags.
Quite annoyed that I can't my English versions of kalevala and poetic edda.
<- holy fuck tihs game is in so much trouble.
That isn't youtube buffering.
Aww I expected some hilarious glitch like in RDR.
Kain_Spoo i presume you can make some interesting glitches happen in performance conditions lke that.
But no its just shitty slowdown where the game really shouldn't be.
Thats running at the lowest settings on a high performance gameing rig of a reviewer.
That simply should not be happning outside of unusual conditions.
No way they didn't know this was the case.
I imagine there is a lot of panicked scrambling going there.
I know pc's are a fickle platform and hard to test for.
But this seems to be too widespread and noticable to have not been known.
Combine thta with the fact there was no pc review code.
They did it anyway.
Ah yeah forgot that part.
1 Stone of Jordan.
Its a diablo joke.
Well he was clearly looking to sell something but didnt specify what exactly P.
I'll give you 3 Eth's for it and a chipped ruby.
Wts is what the shit.
I use it all the time.
How are you even.
Minister yes we know.
I had no idea.
Jesus christ my ear hurts atm.
I doubt this will actually affect the publisher.
Last time I had a blockage in my ear it turned out to be an infection.
Sooo you might wanna get that checked out.
Unless everyone goes for a Steam refund.
Minister probably not long term. and they'll just pretend it didn't happen publicly.
Plus everyone complaining already paid their sixty bucks or so for it.
Gonna phone the doctors at the appointment time see if I can be seen tomorrow.
And I'd expect most of their sales to be on console anyway and... yeah.
Minister which is why i expect there was never a review copy.
Just cash in the pre-order and day 1 purchases.
Hope steam refunds don't get too bad.
I just looked up at the news and the only subtitle was efficient ruthless Tory machine.
I'm considering getting a bunch of DKoK guys for my guard and using my Cadians as conscripts or something.
How much will I regret this?
Well your wallet will obviously regret it.
But Kriegers are really easy to paint tbh and Im sure you have experience with resin.
Look at this guy though.
Doesnt look too hard compared to other FW models tbh.
I mean just look at the Primarchs.
Well I wouldn't be painting them Kreiger colours.
I mean look at how awesome that guy is.
Cant say I did mine in Krieger colours either.
So I have about 5 hours to spend in turku if I go with this plan. Which is a good thing since I have to walk 6km unless I somehow find a bus.
Well not find can afford.
Cooked_Auto those are good need to tone down the higlighting a little though.
Not my colourscheme so.
And I know fuck all about colour theory so.
I mean make the lines thinner.
Aha lack of thin brushes vOv.
I prefer painting Krigers over those any day p.
I need to buy paints this week when Im in stockholm damn the prices.
Twenty four hours twenty four hours.
Gimme a second for a backup.
As a sidenote I packed pretty much 90% of my stuff yesterday v.
Kaun obviously remembers my physique a bit inaccurately.
Just need to pack bedsheets just in case.
Oh yeah I was meaning to ask will I have to pack sheets and such?
Well otherwise I guess a trip to IKEA is in order P.
No no you won't need bedsheets.
Glenny are you staying with us the whole stay?
Err. probably not the whole thing at least. You ended up in sweden...Tomorrow right?
Yup tomorrow until the 30th.
I'll probably aim for thursday or friday I think. pretty sure I wont depart today not mentally prepared for the journey yet.
When will we see you? >.
Yay! Thank you for sorting it out. It'll be nice to meet you!
Man I need to fill my phone with some traveling music.
Ive got podcasts myself.
Seeing as I will be traveling for....17-18 hours I think?
With no sleep in between so that will be fun.
Wow.. that is a looong journey! /.
Wouldn't be so bad but the 10 hours on boat will be booooriiiing.
Even my journey is only ~9hrs total.
So thats a hour to helsinki 2 hours on bus to Ã¥bo 5 hours there which I will probably spend mostly walking the 6km journey from the bus stop to harbour and then 10 hours on boat.
Well my only comfort is that I would have gotten paid by Thursday so I can buy you rum.
I think the trip back wont be as bad.
Well there is still the 10 hour boat trip and 2 hours on bus but I think I can cut 5 hours of turku time when I return.
You know whats daft?
It costs less to travel from helsinki to turku by bus than it does traveling from here to helsinki.
How far away from Helsinki are you?
So who wants some weird dutch news?
We're suffering a baby milk powder shortage.
~10km from the centre.
Because and tihs is the best part.
People resell it in china!
MoonWolf is there something wrong with Dutch womens breasts?
Note to self Do not buy cocaine in dutchland.
Our poweder is fine.
Our production is at normal levels.
Its just getting bought or stolen and shipped out of the country to be sold in china.
Because chinese people distrust their own producers.
Which wouldn't be an issue since its only a small amount of people in china buying it.
But a small amount in china.
Is still a problem here.
Tldr china wants all the dutch breast milk it can get?
Doubt its just dutchland.
Wonder if I should recommend packing with a raincoat or not v.
Then again I have no idea if the weather in Stockholm will be as wet as it has been where I live recently.
Currently it is pissing down outside.
Yeaah there seems to a risk of a lot of rain next week.
Yeah bring a raincoat!
I dont even have a raincoa.
You can borrow my umbrella it's not *too* girly.
Apples aren't girly right.
Scout option Black trashbag.
Or I could just get wet. I dont mind rain really.
As long as its not snow or 5c outside.
It's funny how a lot of coworkers have asked me ohhh is it snowy over there in Sweden.
Stockholm weather seems pretty similar to what we have here atm.
At least you dont keep hearing constant polarbear jokes =p.
You are a polar bear.
Sadly Im not a gay hunk =p.
Wonder if a Polar Bear would be an older Bear or not.
Gay slang for a grey haired older hairy chubby guy. Or a guy that looks like Santa Claus without the suit.
Santa Claus without the suit.. jeez.
There are a bunch of other similar definitions.
Any chance someone here wants to go to ArcTanGent this year?
If thats checks out.
Â 'well how are they different to RPGs coming from other countries what's the difference?' Hahaha seriously?
How do you even Nomura.
Nomura is mad that people call Final Fantasy a JRPG instead of just an RPG.
Has he PLAYED a western rpg ?
Does he not get that its a genre.
I mean there are western jrpg.
There are japanese western rpgs.
Minister also he should be honestly happy they call it a jrpg.
Final fantasy is THE jrpg.
Its the defining series.
I see guns are still completely useless.
I see you didn't go back for the nobitsura-kage.
Also they now have trees in the japanese classical architecture that are NOT cherries.
I like the level design in this stage.
So apparently Miles Morales is becoming the new 616 Spider-man.
Or something because the article is really vague about if they're referring to movie or comic.
If they make movie spiderman black spiderman that'll be amazing.
Also the internet will be angry.
But it'll be amazing.
He's half afroamerican and half puertorican apparently.
Sure but black spiderman is easier to say.
I will make love to that minigun.
Well I for one dont like it.
The minigun or spiderman.
Daaaymn good thing I get paid in a week I will not have a lot of cash left once I pay off my credit card.
They'll probably go back on it after a year or two.
Like dc did on the whole new52.
Oh new52 is gone now.
That's been rebooted into something else that I cant remember on the top of my head.
But Im pretty sure its very similar to how Marvel is doing Secret Wars.
Mfw Blizzard don't have single-click unsubscribe on their newsletters |.
If people wanna watch GRRM talk.
Sadly he is not eating anything.
What did he go on a hunger strike until he finishes the next book?
Fear not with his girth he can last for years.
Well we can give him some candy tomorrow.
I thought the whole shindig with him at SFBok was today and that was being streamed.
Hm.. maybe well I'll have my friend bring some food up from her restaurant on Friday then.
Maybe I should start cooking dinner.
Diablo 2 does not run on windows 10.
You just get shit performance and no sound.
Why even bother switching?
Oh lord I found the external from jukly.
Loading over a bunch of stuff to the external Im bringing with me.
Not that I see us watching all of the AMV Hells anyway but still p.
True does sorta depend on if we can hook the laptop to the tv maybe.
Ought to have hdmi in.
Yeah I think so.
I mean its Stockholm. We can pretty much go and buy the cable we need without much of a issue p.
Nope it's the middle aged only avi.
Also transfering over KLK to it.
Although maybe we shouldnt watch the documentary about Romans with Terry Jones. The food section might give people ideas P.
ChaosSmurf you know stuff about CSGO whats with the massive viewership today ?
MoonWolf I have no idea.
Is there a tourney on.
That's not that big.
But yeah there's a showmatch on.
It gets League numbers these days.
Must be one hell of a showmatch then.
If valve released a cardgame.
They could top all three major esports games.
They top it when they do big tourneys.
I just had the dumbest tavern brawl idea.
Permanent lorewalker cho effect.
So Shadowrun Revvie finally got art.
Well at least art I can link here P.
I assume there will be.
The all legendaries mirror at some point.
Probably alliance vs. horde.
ChaosSmurf all spider hunter vs all portal mage.
Fairly sure portal mage wins every time.
ChaosSmurf so people have been taking apart the batman game and it turns out.
A lot of graphics options are not enabled on it.
Apparently the PC devs for it worked on the Borderlands 2 vita port.
Which also if I remember right had atrocious performance.
MoonWolf what a surprise.
No ambient occlusion no rain effects on clothing.
What I don't understand.
Is how these people will backwards engineer.
Without any access to the actual code.
These problems in days literally days.
MoonWolf Sadly it seems like that screenshot I linked earlier was faulty.
Cooked_Auto does not suprime me.
But the games are released like this from companies that pay their employees and force them to work 12 hour days.
ChaosSmurf well a number of those are easy.
You can force a game into all sorts of graphics modes with the driver software.
Without needing to do anything to the game executable.
Yeah but look at Dark Souls.
Now the patch that dude released isn't anywhere near as good or useful as people imply.
But damn it took him about 10 hours.
Another part is ini files but lets leave that alone.
Very often though its well udnerstood common use engines unreal source etc.
So they can't fix performance well on those within hours.
But they can fuck around with the graphics settings.
Because they've done that before.
Ini editing? Isn't that like pirating the game or something? O Or whatever the WatchunderscoreDogs dev went on about.
With all the shite turned on.
Because it looks pretty baller on PS4.
Probably runs like a snail on a treadmill.
MoonWolf In this BGBWP update yadda yadda yadda yadda over the shoulder.
Somebody will have strapped it to their quad SLI'd Titan Xs.
And be romping around thinking it's real.
On their triple 4K screen setup.
Can you even DO that ?
Is that a thing that titans support.
Quad SLI? don't know.
You can SLI them I think.
I know you can SLI titans.
Supposedly the performance gain is not worth the money.
But some people just don't care about money.
SLI hasn't been worth it in yonks.
You can tell because they own more than 0 titans.
Like at least 6-7 years.
I think a single Titan is probably defendable now.
The new ones though.
And it's sorta like alienware is defendable.
In that my penis is larger than yours way.
They're like 10% better than the new gtx ti?
I'm getting a 970.
Because it looks rad and cheap.
ChaosSmurf btw your unreal article was good.
Though still debating between that and a PS4.
Fuck me did it go up.
Graphics card AMD Radeon R9 200 Series 1920x1080x32bit 60Hz.
Nobody fucking tells me anything.
Yeah few hours ago.
Didn't think of it again untill now.
Such fucking garbage answers to my questions.
Lemme see how much Graham changed in edit.
Yeah the interview seemed pretty generic.
Developers that actually have something useful to SAY seem thin on the ground these days.
I blame pr training.
Oh wow he changed fuck all.
I honestly thought this piece was fucking ass.
Because of how bad the answers were.
I sent him really good really indepth questions he could have answered in loads of interesting ways.
But it meant I just gave him enough rope to generi-hang himself with.
Its good because it tells people that don't have their eyes close on unreal what the actual effects of the community stuff is.
Besides it exists and is on the store.
I could be wrong though.
Maybe others think its ass.
Got a link to this article thing so I can tell smurf how wrong he is?
Okay my version was basically identical.
But the last paragraph was this.
I asked Steve if a less ambitious normal 'boxed copy' release could have worked for the project avoiding these possible issues.
Minister I almost certainly wont be around on thursday.
It might have been possible but this community focused development model is such a natural fit for UT that I'm really glad we are following it. And we will definitely end up with a better game as a result.
ChaosSmurf i'm not sure he's right but he's definitly not wrong ?
By which i mean yes its a very natural fit and its a great experiment.
Steve? nah I think he's right.
I think they will get a better game in the long long long run.
But i don't know if it'll work in the long run to make a profitable game.
But it's very possible they could have a 6 month period where it's total ass.
Profitability wise I'm worried about it.
I think part of it is unreals older games mod community.
And how the people who USED to do that.
Are now the right age to produce professional assets and shit.
So they're hitting a weird sweet spot.
They're also doing paid mods.
Where they have a nostalgic fanbase of modders mature enough to do this with some level of professionalsim also dying to see a new old unreal.
It's also a pretty good game now.
Tried to play Reflex the other day.
Yeah it also just feels great to play.
Now it was amazing a while back from what I remember.
They changed the movement model.
I didn't like it before they added the slide.
Probably will do it a fe wmore times.
And the UT3 weapons look.
So out of place.
Should have use the 2k4 assets.
Might have to play a few rounds some time next week once I am done with witcher 3.
Though those probably look too out of date.
Dare I look at the IRC channel.
GlennCuttlefish you'll love the slide.
It's the most I've seen adding something small to a game changing it for the better ever.
That was some good english in that line right there but you get what I mean.
Remember people ChaosSmurf is a professional words writer.
MoonWolf Gameplay note Hrothgar sounds like a very insistent GM one who has VERY SPECIFIC ideas about how the next few encounters will play out... Ah the height of terrible campaigns.
Cooked_Auto remember all the IWD npcs there are author inserts they don't exist in IWD1 because it was a completly player generated party without dialogue.
Like that isnt painfully obvious by now.
Jeeesus christ the dialogue.
So many fucking WORDS.
Looks like they haven't found it.
Debating linking it myself.
Could have found it before you figure out it existed.
Nah I scrolled up to 5.
The first thing someone said after 5 was this article is trash.
Linking to a John Romero tweet.
And I was like oh jesus fuck.
Then the Romero tweet was a link to an RPS article and I was like OH FUCKING CHRIST PLEASE NO.
And then it was John's VR article and everything was fine.
I haven't read it.
I agree with the sentiment outlined in its header.
Its basically VR is a gimmick and its going to die.
But I know it made lots of people very mad because it was written by John Walker.
Unless they can fundamentally change the hardware required so its ubiquitous and trivial to use.
And thats probably not wrong ?
Somebody said that he basically said that.
But then also he said that even if they do that it's fucked because they wont' do that.
But this was all the sort of people who used to work for RPS until they were fired.
One day walker will be the kind of people who USED to work for RPS.
Not for a while I feel.
Another 18 years left on his dad jail sentence for one thing.
If I'm ever in a position to give a speech where games journalism is relevant.
A not insiginificant portion of it will be about how lovely John is.
Don't let kikijiki hear.
Not least because the only places that is likely to happen are places where he would hate to have a speech read out about him.
He realy doesn't like the guy.
I'm fairly sure that's just kiki being kiki.
Rather than any actual inemnity.
Is that a word.
I think I meant inenmity.
Oh wait yeah I meant without the in.
VR goggles seem really awesome and all but it wont work because of the cost.
GlennCuttlefish cost and effort.
Wheres the effort part.
Besides going out and buying one once its out.
GlennCuttlefish its like setting out your joystick and putting your pedals in place for your flightsim.
Only this time you have to strap on a head device.
I put my headphones on when ever I want to hear sound from my PC I assume its not that big of a deal with goggles.
Its a bit bigger of a deal.
Which is the problem.
Yeah being blind vs. slightly deaf.
Because if it wasn't everyone would have some.
Like I can still hear myself typing with headphones on.
But not everyone will have some.
When it is a chip in my skull.
So not having some will be the defeaul programmers account for.
Or a room I walk into.
Then it will be something that could go somewhere.
Sort of like directx versions.
Half the games still account for 10.
I'd say half the games are still on 9.
Not enough games are still on 9.
<- also this.
Yeah I RTed that earlier.
They still make those ChaosSmurf.
Have we all bought them? I think I've binned mine now but I had RA2 and WC3.
I have bought 0.
I have a bunch of mag guides for Pokemon.
ChaosSmurf let me tell you a funny thing.
Its probably not there anymore.
But for the longest time.
The library in the city closest to me.
Had a strategy guide for Quake.
It came with a CD with some pretty good mods.
Assuming it was the same one.
If it was mint condition it's probably worth a couple of quid.
Dunno never got it out.
I just know it was there.
I used to rent games from the library.
And some of them didn't have DRM.
They had jazz jakkrabbit.
I never got it.
And some RC cars racer.
Top-down was pretty good actually.
Could edit ini files to make cards differnet.
My first and last modding experience.
The main library in the town I went to uni in had a Gundam novel on its shelves.
Also while i was finding the name of that game again.
I'm imagining renting StarCraft now.
I found out Sudeki is on pc now.
I CAN'T GIVE THIS BACK.
I guess you probably didn't have that reaction.
Ah Septerra Core when westerns tried making JRPGs.
Cooked_Auto the card magic was cool.
I might buy it on steam one day and play it again.
I mean the graphics were kinda eh even then.
Anyone here played Sudeki ?
And base combat mechanics so and so.
If I recall it was an old Xbox launch title.
I really liked it back then.
Damn you playlist making me want to experience tribes again |.
I miss going fast in that game.
Yeah nobody has ever cared less than the UT guys do about that UT piece.
Effect and one jewelry effect. Hope that helps!
With the current plan the passives you get by breaking down Legendary items with special effects in Kanai's Cube do not replace passive skills on your character but are instead part of a separate set of passives that are specifically stored within the cube. You can store as many special effects as possible in the cube but only a limited number can be active at a given time currently this is three one weapon effect one armor.
Better than the Star Citizen reaction.
Okay that's what I thought.
Even if it'd be cool if you could just have them all on it'd be unreal busted.
This means i can finally make frenzy barb work.
Does my build fall off.
The big rock build.
Big Rock is fine.
What are the other skills meant to be.
Cause I just use the ultimates.
Its not as good as whirlwind forever or charge everything to death though.
Whirlwind is so snore.
And if you get it wrong you just die.
The Reakor set makes it so you can charge basically forever and the Vile Ward shoulders make it do more damage beyond the buffs from the reakor set depending on how many things you hit.
Its a really boring build.
You kill bosses slowly by vibrating against them.
Man my tribes playlist was cheesy.
Oh charge is the sprint right?
Anyway yeah that sounds fucking awful.
No sprint is a temporary movement speed boost.
Tbh all the barb builds are.
Charge is actually just a charge.
I don't even remember it.
It wasnt that good before.
Just a mediocre way to move around.
I dunno what the other classes are like.
Melee in Diablo is not fun.
And then it isn't fun anyway.
Farewell CM wizard builds.
And you made my fingers hurt.
Also i still want OSKILLS.
But i guess thats not hapening.
Most of this album was gold for tribes. warning Sappy electronic music.
ChaosSmurf okay so in diablo 2.
It was common for unique and runeword items to give you +skill points.
Either to a skill directly to a category or to all skills.
But those would only increase skillpoints in skills you already had points in.
You could also have bonuses to specific skills that did NOT care about how many hard points you had.
A lot of the tracks on that playlist seem to take about a minute to get going. Which is about the time I needed to set up a good run being the scrub that I am in that game.
In effect giving you that skill.
Alowing necromancers to throw fireballs.
Or people to use auras even if they were not a paladin.
The really neat part is that some mods use that to make items that just have new skills.
Classes don't get that skill.
Only people with that item equipped do.
I need to give S4 league another try as well I heard there is a new provider for that game now.
I assume you don't mean League of Legends.
No. I mean S4 league.
And if you do I don't know what you mean by provider.
That's kinda just legendaries though right?
Though not the cross-class portion.
Legendaries are all passives.
Or modifictions of existing stuff.
Tbh I don't want more active abilities.
But they can't cause consoles.
If i'd make it you'd have to choose it over an existing active ability.
So there is a bow that gives you some sort of neat shooty spell.
But you'd have to not have one of your class abilities slotted for it.
I like the pic.
I don't really get the joke.
But I like it.
So you know how plants like that ripple in the wind?
MoonWolf they'd be hard to balance.
Because if they're good it's annoying.
Wasnt orange and purple kinda the Space Jam colours?
And if they're bad it's worse.
But I guess that's how they balance everything.
And they've done an alright job so far.
So if it happened in that picture would it be a picture of a wheat wave?
Guys I just figured out something and i feel dumb now.
What is this sudden insight you have gained?
A Bugs Life is basically 70% Seven Samurai adaptation.
Why are you watching a bugs life.
It's better than antz I suppose.
Or that bee movie.
I was discussing seven samurai style stories in relationship to sc2 Legacy of the Void.
And then i just realized.
This is a discussion I'm interested in hearing the cliffnotes of.
And can't remember what SS style stories are.
A Village under attack by an outside force gets together and hires a group of 7 somewhat disreputable men to protect them.
See 7 Samura Magnificent 7 for the most original versions of it.
How does this relate to Legacy.
It relates vaguely to the original pitch for Legacy with the diplomacy and such I suppose.
Remember that impromptu talk that was at some con blizzard was at where everything was failing.
Where they were announcing more GvG cards.
When Browder ended up doing an impromtu QA?
And he compared it to Seven Samurai.
I remember it happening but I don't remember what happened.
Need to find this shit for cleaning my screen.
Anyway long story short.
I've found the rag.
Someone was talking about starwars clone wars cartoon.
And how it had a seven samurai arc.
And i was like well you can write seven samurai in basically anything blizzard is doing it in sc2.
My brain was like Ant movie.
Is wherever you said that as easy to bait with talk of the SC2 story as everywhere I happen to mention it.
People sure can't wait to point out how bad it is even though it isn't that bad.
Only took me over a decade or so to figure out.
Though HotS did not help.
A brand new Mahjong Pretty Girls Battle is now about to begin! Cute school girls gathered for a hot Mahjong battle! An extraordinary collection of Pretty School Girls is waiting for you! Authentic Japanese Mahjong rules. Including settings for some famous local rule variants. Tags Casual Anime Nudity.
He also needs to exile a blue card from his hand.
Know what Hearthstone needs.
No it does NOT.
No game needs Force of Will.
It should be in more of its formats.
As it would be interesting in Standard and probably really useful in Modern.
But it isn't in the spirit of HS I agree.
Aside from the mechanics not fitting in the HS no reactive spells framework.
Its just the most boring passive No Fun card.
It's a good passive no fun card.
Does not search card titles.
What else is boring.
That is the worst.
The one with buyback.
Though I do like.
!mtg whispers of the muse.
ChaosSmurf Forbid seems to expensive to chain cast.
So its not that bad.
Assume your opponenet is drawing upwards of 3-4 cards a turn.
Or has cards with madness.
Or cards with flashback.
Damn Heavensward already came out? D.
Couple of days back.
I was meant to be writing about it.
But the editor never got back in touch with me.
6 mana repeatalbe card draw.
There goes my plan to finish the story line >.>'.
Seems... too expensive ?
You just do it EOT every time you have the spare mana.
In v. long games.
Or cash it in if you get in trouble.
Still not nearly on the level of force of will or stasis of fuck fun though.
Nah you don't understand Force of Will.
ChaosSmurf Cobb did it on RPS sort of.
Force of Will makes more fun happen.
!mtg force of will.
Because it stops combo decks.
...yeah what's wrong with FoW.
And lets you win games against control decks because you can play a creature and counter their wrath.
It's just a counter with a pick one of two cost.
Noelor its a card that goes you thought you could play a spell but actually no fuck your spell.
Pure control would rather play incremental advantage cards or cheaper counters like Daze.
MtG is a game with counters.
And they lose an additional card which is a pretty big loss.
The life is not very big.
That particular counter is an interesting variant of counter.
But counters are already and pretty unlikely ever to not be part of MtG.
That talk you linked was super interesting btw.
Particularly the stuff about having a stack originally.
And how shit the game was for ages.
Yeah i liked it too.
Stacks just are so SLOW.
Oh Tales from the Borderlands 3 is out.
I should really look up more GDC talks.
It's MADNESS that it isn't streamed.
Probably not nearly as bad in person.
I guess that's why I watched Ep 2 recently.
I'd pay Â£20-30 for it easy.
But for a game you have to ask every time do you want to do a thing?
I'll probably watch Ep3 about when Ep4 comes out.
Yeah every implementation of online Magic suffers because of it.
And I don't think there's an easy way to do one.
I can't think of a good digital CCG with one.
Solforge doesn't have one Ascension doesn't have one really.
ChaosSmurf the best solution i have.
But it's so important to a better game.
Is programatically determine every question you cannot have an awnser too and autoskip it on your side.
But insert a token pause on their side.
So they can't tell.
Still doens't work great in magic where you can respond to basically anything with anythng else.
You'd just learn how long the pause was tho.
I cast any spell let me just start drawing cards.
I end my turn wait a moment let me just resolve half a turn of stuff with this mana i have left befor emy own starts.
It's pretty fun in real life.
Feels like you're doing free shit.
Feels like you're actually playing with someone.
Thankfully Hearthstone doesn't REALLY compete with Magic.
In a taking-money-from-the-game-sense anyway.
MTG is particularly bad about this though.
It's bad for that.
But netrunner's way more complex.
I should finish this e-mail I've been writing for 3 hours.
So far I have hi phil.
Thats not an email.
Nah there's a bit more but it's pretty awful so I don't wanna copy it.
My e-mails to new editors make me squirm.
One day I'll give up.
HI PLEASE GIVE ME MONEY TO WRITE FOR YOU.
I DO IT ALL.
Also great at clickbait.
So fucking good at clickbait dude.
Not actually that good at clickbait Graham is always changing my opening paragraphs and titles.
Ie the entire bait part of that equation.
I was going to run a story through the alt text on the headers of all my Steam sale posts.
But then I ran out of steam.
Well no he commissions those.
Although I have a big pitch I'm working on that's a big expansion of them.
Literally doing all the work.
I assume I must be doing something right clickbait wise!
Because so far I have written THE BEST GAMES OF 2015.
THE BEST GTA VIDS.
THE BEST GTA MODS.
THE BEST X OF Y.
THE BEST Z OF Q.
Did you even play GTAV?
He played it befor eyou did Noelor.
I really should just get around proof reading/polishing a story Ive been meaning to toss onto Amazon next month.
Before anyone else did.
They paid him for it.
Before it was finished...
I do remember that.
The ETHICAL WORRIES OF WHICH do kinda freak me a bit.
You are in the credits thus making you the perfect person to write a listicle about it!
Only because somebody could make a big deal if they'd like to.
I don't think it affected me at all.
So long as it's just listicles.
But it doesn't help that everything I wrote was overall positive.
You didn't do a review or anything.
Because it was clickbait celebrating the community.
So there isn't much here to be ETHICAL about.
Also yes about the community.
I don't think it's actually a big deal.
I mention it whenever I'm commissioned for something on it.
It doesn't seem that way to me.
That is the important part.
But it would be to Colonel Gamergate.
As I understand these things.
This isn't real.
This can't be real.
Well it's a lucky thing there's no members of the Gamergate rank and file here then.
I really hope it is.
ChaosSmurf you're not a minority or saying gamergate should stop attacking minorities in gaming.
So none of them give a damn about you.
I probably should do that second one more.
But I already threatened to fight a group of them IRL this month.
Maybe that was Stanton.
ChaosSmurf holy shit that site.
A day in which Stanton doesn't threaten to fight someone.
MoonWolf I think it's a mockup by one of the esl guys.
That's who I saw linking it anyway.
Is... I'm too tired to punchline.
Oh jesus the video plays.
Nah this is not real.
Still curious what the footage is from.
Then again the Mad Max shirt Im wearing now is almost better.
Imagine if it were though!
It's a generic esports b-roll.
Oh my god I think it's real.
For some defintion of that word.
I have concert exp. but not this.
Either this is a very complicated troll.
Or a the dumbest scam.
GlennCuttlefish that was a Poppy strip today alright.
I was there for all the good esports scams.
What was that site I worked for for 15 minutes.
Man I fucking with.
Should hook up with THE MILLER REPORT.
Still trying to get Tseric stuff.
I found his mate.
No idea how to contact her.
Do you e-sport game?
This man is hip and in with the kids.
The Miller Report needs an esports episode.
Grmbl my keyboard died.
Or ran out of batteries.
Also did you see my message about missing thursday noelor.
I assume it's because you're now going to be over the border?
...that was an odd phrasing that I'm not sure why I used.
Yes. well on the way there.
I can deal with that.
You could if you want just borrow my laptop p.
Wont be in sweden until....1900 or so on friday.
Possibly thursday will check tickets in morning.
Holy FUCK GamesRadar needs to be better.
To repeat a conversation I think we had with MoonWolf last week Sweden and Finland not at all small countries.
So much talent poured into a black hole.
ChaosSmurf so much wasted website space.
I think i will just fall asleep once i get there c_a p.
Future are so bad dude.
ChaosSmurf this seems an odd format for an interview.
I'll try not to be too loud for Shadowrun.
Worry not i am a heavy sleeper. also snorer bring earplugs D.
Eeh my aunt and grandma snore like sawmills.
It was just an interview.
And I got dick answers so I had to pad it with my own thoughts.
I wasn't even contacting him directly it all went through Flak.
Tonight I played One Night Werewolf.
I don't know if I like it.
ChaosSmurf No SEMI-COLON DEE?
Maybe it's just one of those games that only works with friends.
Assuming it's like the old werewolf.
We played it in drama club and it was great.
But only because we were tired and 15.
Well see that's part of it.
I went into the first game expecting werewolf.
So I was just really confused.
I think it has now been over a year since I reviewed anything.
And 3 days in fact.
It's like instead of people dying there's just dicking around with where the cards are and then it's this dumb mix of logic and bluffing.
Didn't help we were playing with one of those people who gets mad if people don't play how she thinks they should.
Which I always respond to by deliberately playing wrong.
You did that to me once.
I don't think it was even a game.
Just dumb IRC stuff.
Before we even knew each other.
Teenage me was a complete cunt.
You were probably better than me.
He was an adult at the time.
Nah I do have control freak tendencies I'm just getting better at reigning it in over time.
I meant the deliberately playing wrong bit.
I think Ana is the one who tried to get us to play certain ways and got mad when we didn't P.
Then I'm not sorry at all don't try and force me into your system.
Throw me on the ground.
As we've discussed if anything you didn't assert enough control.
Over the games you were in.
Wait I've lost track of what we're talking about.
I dunno I honestly think the games where just RP happened for multiple hours were the best.
Particularly that last BSJ one.
I prefer some structure if it's a long running thing.
But we've discussed this when it comes to Fate and such before.
So it's personal pref.
The reason I didn't impose structure on SM is that would have required long-term planning.
Yeah that'll do it.
It went remarkably well for a remarkably long time considering.
When Ex3 comes out final review of the pdf by H H happening this week! and I run that.
It will be a fairly structured thing.
That said I had a plot in mind for Mage.
And thta got derailed within half a session.
I kinda don't want Ex3 to come out now.
Because it will be either incredibly nostalgic and make me sad.
Or it will be shit and make me sad.
Or I won't have time and will be sad.
Being grown up is awful.
Particularly without a real job.
Apparently my uncle was chatting shit to my mom about me not having a real job.
So I had to tell her how much money I was making this month.
Now she wants me to pay for the tickets to London I didn't want in the first place...
Time to pitch more clickbait.
What kind of features do we think Polygon would be interested in.
Forward thinking social commentary.
I think there's more than enough of that.
At least from people with as little influence opinion or experience as me anyway.
Lack of brown people in batman.
Yeah I think I'll leave that to whatsisname.
No take it from them. then skin them and dye the hide darker.
Are you feeling okay GlennCuttlefish.
It is what they would want.
I'm not sure it is mate.
Also no everything is terrible.
If it makes you feel better.
Has polygon ever decided the number of sides it has as a polygon?
I'm probably not going to pitch to Kotaku.
Because their UK editor is dodgy.
Batteries died and i am using on screenn keyboard.
You could write a piece on that to prompt debate.
Not a bad idea.
GlennCuttlefish I have a keyboard here.
Its just dead batteries.
I feel like you've brought this on yourself.
By using a wireless keyboard.
Ehh. guess i will have to skin myself and dye the hide.
It's the only way out.
Solution to all of lifes little problems.
Nah just plug the usb cable up your nostril and control the text that way.
Any usb will do.
Dob are you okay.
Massive anxiety angst over uni results not being out yet but otherwise good.
Why aren't they out yet.
It's been mere weeks since exams finished.
English unis run about a month behind Scottish ones.
Two weeks in fact I think?
Well other people in my uni on other courses had results posts up last wk.
Oh then I have no idea.
Burn down the proverbial disco.
Just ones in my dept the word is release end of this wk.
It's possible nobody I know who isn't in final year.
Nice line break ben well done you did it.
Master of the return key.
Anyway I thought Polygon was all op-eds.
I don't know what they're like because despite liking them more than 95% of the vocal population I don't actually read the site regularly.
Also loving double negative subjective.
Dob tbh it's clarity through exclusion more than it's double-negative.
Yours seem more important.
Fun fact because I recently started contributions to my pension my salary has fallen back below the mark where my student loan gets paid off.
And by fun I mean I'm so glad this doesn't actually affect my credit rating oh gods the eternal tax supplement oh well I suppose at least it's discrete.
I don't even know how they track my income.
Well nobody tracks my income.
I'm pretty sure you're supposed to do it yourself.
I REALLY SHOULD go tell the government.
Wanting to buy things.
You are proving the tories right you realise this right?
When people like Ana say Nobody poor actually steals from the government and commits fraud only rich people do that.
David Cameron can just point at you.
Steal is a strong term.
And say what about this cunt.
Nah I totally am.
I'm still getting benefits like I have the job I was fired from 4 months ago.
Not his problem tis hmrc's.
I've never gone over the tax limit.
Without spending myself under it on things I needed.
Need to step up their game stop going after the 80 billion they think they can get off vodafone and amazon dot ca.
As HMRC are responsible for collecting the money used to make sure he can for instance stay clean and use electricity.
I don't think that's entirely how it works?
And even if it were.
There are forms and things.
I can hear you over my fingers in my ears going lalala.
You brought it up!
Yeah I think the 'collectors' side of utility co's is different from hmrc.
HMRC and the government.
Can suck my dick.
Either will just find the heavies most available at the time to break some fingers.
Well utilities are privatised but they're regulated - this isn't the point.
Please don't go to jail.
Is basically my point.
I am FAIRLY SURE.
I have plausible deniability.
For knowing I needed to pay it.
And will be able to pay it off in bursts.
That is super not how it works.
Mostly the second bit.
I mean if it gets to the point I owe several thousand pounds they could actually criminally prosecute.
I'd do well in jail.
Soft and cuddly sure.
What's the worst that could happen.
I'm going to completely change the topic.
And say I have 0 care for Antman.
Shit when is that out.
I just can't find it in myself to look forward to it.
Thought it was this month.
There's only 7 days left of this month.
I'll likely see it just out of completion sake.
I'll go see it with whoever can be arsed from my friend group.
It's not even relevant to the others though.
And then they can tell me which secret wars comics I should actually catch back up with.
That we know of.
It'll have a relevant outro.
Oh man Secret Wars.
I was reading all of it and then I moved house while working.
And now I have about a gig of unread with at least one wednesday undownloaded.
I was going to read all of it then uni then flat-hunting.
I need to call a couple of estate agents tomorrow and arrange some more viewings for Friday afternoon.
But it looks like my choices are going to be.
A a nice place that's about ten minutes further out from town than I would ideally be.
B a place in need of care in a good location.
C a place I can't afford in a good location that I then have to persuade my parents is a good investment to help me buy.
Forgot you were buying.
I will prrrrobably pick a.
But I dunno what your parental situation is like now.
Other than I'm still not telling them about stuff.
And am hiding makeup and things in the bottom of my sock drawer.
Finding it very difficult not to troll someone on my feed who doesn't like Taylor Swift.
And... okay this is going to sound dumb but you know that scene in Amazing Spiderman 2 where Pete realises he can't use Aunt May's washing machine for his Spidey suit?
You can pay 'em back right.
I can also make obvious conclusions based on you asking that.
ANYWAY on principle of why I'm moving I don't want to ask them for help unless I find a properly fantastic place in the perfect location.
Yeah I'm all in on being independent.
So dat is fair enough.
And as it's looking like I'll only get one of those.
I'll go for ten minutes further from the high street over needs new windows and floors.
It'll make you fitter.
Assuming you're still biking.
When the former might also actually be cheaper.
Same distance from work.
Well when I move I won't be able to just borrow Dad's car.
So yes I will be!
I hope your parents aren't weird about it.
A mate of mine's went a bit mental when she moved out.
HOW COULD YOU BETRAY US type deal.
Mum's being really helpful.
Her job involves visiting lots of people in their homes and she's been working in the areas I'm looking to move to so.
She knows what's what with neighbourhoods and how houses compare to others nearby.
Like we went to one on Saturday the agent was all and you know this used to be a council estate but everyone's buying the houses now it's a really nice area totally improved.
But like two minutes earlier my mum made damn sure we left all our bags in the boot of the car instead of the front seat.
I have never come close to being burgled.
And have literally left my door open multiple times.
Sure my mum's a little paranoid in that regards.
Did you see this btw.
Dob my low-effort costume for Sunnycon is fully assembled and all fits.
Now I just need to shave my limbs and bleach my hair.
It is some sort of glorious.
There must be a github.
I.e. showing revisions allowing reverts.
Possibility to be kept private.
Lags on the 300ish page document I'm talking about.
I was thinking dropbox but doesn't have reverts.
MS Word does it.
.'. I assume the various alternative word processors.
I use GDocs for everything because of this.
Is Word not piratable?
But not in a fun way.
We could just use gdocs.
So little fun to edit.
It would be less of a problem.
If wordpress itself wasn't also terrible with this stuff.
So we didn't have to copy out all the HTML.
And the 17 pages it's spread across could be split sensibly but they all have to be one big file because that's how wordpress works.
Oh cool 6FU's Night Witches session went up.
Well at least now I know how shit a george lucas directed StarCraft movie would be.
Bonus points for horrific child murder.
A few people asked if Tedd was a girl in the previous comic. Whenever that happens I mostly just say nothing and pat myself on the back for a mission well accomplished El Goonish Shive 'mastering' androgynous character art for over a decade.
Can the current mystery arc in the mainline just be over now.
Yeah I don't get it.
I think it's just Magus again?
Less mystery more dates.
Meanwhile over in the Sardonyx preview Characters cannot seduce someone who is Intimidated or Terrorized.
Onyx Path finally learning that yes with their reader base they do in fact need to specify these things.
Well time to actually turn off the machine and catch the train. I'll be on way later.
I'm a lawful evil dog!
Well guess that is a sign that it was in fact only batteries that died.
MoonWolf the latest 6FU topical podchat is kinda interesting.
About RPing with/around difficult issues.
Can you link it to me ?
With Ironicus MCing for 4 ladies of varying queeritude.
I will do so when I get home sure.
Reason is boring life stuff.
Turns out I have an ear infection also called swimmer's ear from going swimming once.
OTOH I have co-codamol so slightly buzzed atm.
No clue what that is.
Stockholm is wet and gray I think I'll head back home.
Where its... also whet and gray ?
Nah was sunny this morning.
Well since there is no game today after all guess I'll make plans for being in sweden tomorrow.
There. Trips officially reserved. Will be in sweden around...1800 tomorrow? Not sure if that was local time or not.
What train and where will I have to take from there?
What time are you leaving ?
Have fun with that.
Oh it gets better after 3Â½ hours of sitting in a bus I have to walk 6km.
Bring an audiobook ?
Wait you don't even walk that fast do you.
I assume I can make it in 4 hours maybe. If it looks like I cant i'll just take a bus the rest of the way.
MoonWolf I just remembered Chrome lets me link stuff I have open at home from my phone.
The house is in huddinge about 20 minutes from central station dunno proper address until t shows up.
Kirisu oh did you see game canceling ?
If that's a page link instead of a post link just go to the bottom of the page.
<- not wrong.
Jesus christ I have something even worse than monster decks in gwent.
Such fucking bullshit lol I have one card SURPRISE ITS A 0 ATTACK SPY CARD AND NOW I HAVE 2 CARDS! WHATS THAT? YOU WANT MORE SPY CARDS ON YOUR TABLE? DONT MIND IF I DO.
And then your opponent has 8 cards while you have 0.
Anyone with logs or rollback that might know when cooked is arriving at stockholm?
Yeah I wont be there until 1430 my train leaves Alvesta station at 1051.
Eds on the bus from the airport and having a nerdgams that shock horror there's wifi.
She's from backwater land.
It took years until the train in Wales had powersockets.
Our trains have no powersockets.
Our long distance trains have powersockets I think.
Kirisu the audio balance/clarity of these voices is atrocious.
Or are you Ember atm.
Scene Geralt is having dinner with some woman telling a story about a blue eyed prostitute. His date asks him to go upstairs to show the story ended.
Thing is I remember that quest and it ended with me slaughtering a whole lot of knights.
MoonWolf I'm over here.
!note MairBear played a game of control priest against a druid on my field during the game was 3 yseras and 4 chromagus's.
Idk my ears are too full atm to make a distinction on such things as stereo balance.
I have my notebook open just ... ready to ship.
The Ex3 thread on SA should just be titled if you're having fun you must be doing it wrong.
Because ffs that thread.
There's useful stuff there often enough for me to keep it bookmarked but.
Well I spotted your problem right away.
You are reading SA.
Kirisu was cool thanks.
I like the x card.
Trying to talk here.
Ok done walking in and out of Wi-Fi.
Yes X card is cool.
I'd heard of it before.
Sorry i got distracted by Boring Real Life stuff.
Personally i'd still just prefer to not play a game that rotates around potential problem stuff regardless.
Sure it might come up somewhere for some reason.
But i'd not set out to have a game about it or intentionally include it.
Its a game its a fantasy its escapism.
I don't care to examn real world problem x in it.
Always a valid option.
But sometimes someone wants to play a WW2 game and it's not unreasonable to have a conversation about how real such a game should be ahead of time.
What are we even talking about?
How to handle tabletop games with Difficult Issues.
What those are depends on the context of your group and game.
Like when we chargenned for a Mage.
...game set in Japan.
And I checked if the person playing a white girl in a party with two Japanese men well man and man-ishwas okay with the citizenry ignoring her opinions in favour of theirs.
Mage having a somewhat more serious tone by default than Feng Shui.
I haaaate painting skin D.
Anathema looks okay to me.
The face is rubbish but someone elsewhere gave me some pointers so I may fix it tonight.
One drive website is newer and sexier.
I need to fix that leading.
Why didn't you just build an array and join it with 's ?
Welp time to sleep.
MoonWolf I don't know!
My boss says I have a habit of overlooking the simplest solutions >_>.
Oh I see what the problem is.
My boss says I have a habit of overlooking the simplest solutions >_> <- hah.
To be honest the turn list into comma seperated string thing is like tis annoying little awkward thing.
Where you think it should be completly trivial.
But that leading/starting comma is always annoying.
So every solution just feels a little too complex than what you need.
MoonWolf tavern brawl is any minute now right?
Want to test it head to head? D.
Restarting set it up.
Hrm how do I challenge brawl?
Oh we have to build a deck first.
Easier to build and tlak that way.
Another hour until I can have more delicious painkillers.
My boss got flakk in a meeting 'cause when I updated some other peoples code to work with breaking changes in our framework I missed a couple of bits due to never having looked at the code before S.
It is like being a detective.
Reasons to love SupCom Supcom simulates the game with a real physics engine unlike most other RTS. Each shot trajectory is simulated individually with collision detection. An artillery shell can impact on an airplane.
We're all alive and such.
Getting ready I see.
This is what happens with an open laptop and multiple people.
Especially when one is Kaun.
Hey Cooked_Auto where did I have to take the train to again once I reach sweden? And once I reach that station then what?
GlennCuttlefish Just get yourself to Stockholm Central and we'll get you the rest of the way.
So I was going to just link this an ask the joke is JoJo right?
Then noticed the image name.
And now I've deciphered the text.
Cooked_Auto Ms galaxy somewhere around 1800 tomorrow then.
MoonWolf apparently this is a valid armour set in tOR.
This should go well.
MoonWolf armour explained.
Noelor that doesn't really explain it but ty.
Well it's what we have.
This is very jojo.
Dunno about party boat silja line ship anyway.
Why is zune such a piece of shit.
I mean how do you even do this.
Trying to upload some audio book to my phone but it only finds one of the tracks I copied to that folder.
How do you do this.
Anyhow I'm off. Hopefully in sweden in 18hours and a bit.
MoonWolf Bastion is now being officially referred to as it on the Overwatch feed.
Whereas I think it was he at Blizzcon?
Also wasn't someone asking for Bastion to be next.
Maybe I'm just confusing with Zenyatta idk.
His reload animation is adorables.
Just the gun reloading itself?
That is a fast minigun.
Oh it repairs itself too right.
Is... it a tank?
Oh yeah it says right there.
Anyway I may be misremembering but I think people complained after Blizzcon that as well as all the ladies being a bit TA there were two robots and both were treated as masculine.
When y'know why would robots even have gender etc.
So switching Bastion to it is a really easy response to that.
Don't really understand why this is a thing.
I turned more fans in my case on.
And my computer stopped vibrating as much.
That case has so many fans.
Or places for them at least.
That I don't even know where they are.
I think they're underneath the motherboard maybe.
But they're the loudest.
But if I switch them off it vibrates pretty bad.
Yeah I'm not going to even try to understand.
Noelor The mug and the wobbuffet thing.
I want them to be merchandise in my house.
Wobbuffet is a piggy bank.
Mug might actually exist.
Grumble stupid laptop turning itself off during the night without my permission /.
Throw it in a lake.
On the boat. running on coffee and sugar.
Coffee is priced okay 2.5e for a cup and a scond cup.
Awful. foot clicked dozen or so times.
Scenery was nice turku is an old town and it shows.
Also phone estimated time for the walk? a hour.
Like maybe my mailman friend could do it.
Ii hope i can recharge phone in reception.
Also this boat is full of nerds.
Ran into irc friends theyre going to that con starring angry martin.
Wonder if there are good Windows phone 7 irc clients.
Another thing about turku lots of rabbits.
Maybe i should spam twitter out of boredom.
How is your journey going? I hope it isn't too bad.
Well besides horrible pain boredom and lack of sleep its ok.
MoonWolf But if I throw it in the nearby lake I cant play Shadowrun.
I am sure it will be worth it but the journey is a drag p.
< Sorry it's so craptastic.
Np not your fault i am poor.
Ive already footed the bill for Kauns commuter access card so I can probably do it again.
Boatglenn well there's coffee and bed and internet waiting for you here >.
You're arriving at 6pm right?
Sohey not much walking in that end right? riiight?
I saw a wheelbarrow in the garden we can take shifts to push you.
Also do you have micro usb cables.
Yeah Ive got a micro USB.
I have one you can borrow aye.
I only need it for charging.
Btw the cheap ass bus was amazing for the price.
If not its stockholm and we can buy one at Central station or something.
It was actually really nice no idea how.
I was amazed our bus from the airport had wifi.
Only downside was that the stop was in middle of nowhere.
Well i say middle of nowhere some km from centre.
Ps fuck that one street why was it so long.
3km. one dam n road.
Kaun said you have leg cooties atm? Are you in a lot of discomfort?
Soabout half of my walk was on that road. at least it was waterside.
Not just now i just have to be careful or there will be clanking followed by pain.
Maybe i should raid tax free while still on boat...
Any wishes free of tax?
Not me thank you though. Unless there's rum you like there and I'll buy it for you 3.
I found out something awful a while back.
I dont like most rums anymore.
WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE IS GLENNY?!
Anyhow going to explore the boat finally been sitting in two places for some hours now.
We'll be stopping by Systembolaget at one point at least.
See you later Glenny!
Will stop by irc later if i can get phone charged.
Can you summaries the big ones?
Expansion has more maps higher level camp new companions new abilities.
Patch 2.0 comes with party ai settings and some ui improvements in combat.
Like spell range indicators hit chance displays individual stealth toggles.
Noelor are you intending to play tonight?
If anybody would like to mumble at me.
Boat still dull. ended up buying rum anyway.
Should consider taking a nap in my amazing hobo cabin.
Its not even a cabin just a relatively isolated couch.
Boat rum is possibly the truest rum.
Would be better on a sailboat.
Minister did you see me query @ Noelor?
Clearly sleep is overrated again.
If in here no.
Also no if on Twitter in fact.
My last mention is MoonWolf telling me not to wikihow.
Going to stand by that.
Minister is the game on tonight? 'cause I have an ear infection and a severe lack of sleep.
Where should we meet you? At the dock or at centralstation?
No idea if hiw to get to central station.
Okedoke! No problem we'll be there. Just look for four dorks.
If you don't want to play there won't be a game.
If you do there will.
On account of Glenn is in Sweden and will be sleeping.
Minister so nae pressure p.
But let me know so I can pass it on to Janos.
Mair will probably wow.
I don't have a problem spending my evening playing Civ and watching Steven Universe instead.
Kirisu in that case I don't want to play since I will be knackered and possibly in pain and can only hear out one ear your soothing words can't stop me feeling guilty though.
If I'd known earlier I'd be out tonight D.
Noelor we're hanging on mumbles if you care.
MairBear why is smoke made of skulls.
It's a cave wall.
Why is cave made of skulls.
Noelor join uuussss.
But cos I dunno.
Dob do you know why cave is made of skulls?
Which cave would this be?
The one I literally linked a picture of the line after asking you.
ChaosSmurf so melee button then.
Yeah I see it but I'd need to know the context of the cave.
That's all the context Mair gave me.
Seems standard for bleeding hollow.
ChaosSmurf shoot-at-allies shield seems cool.
Grenade has grenade arcs thus I will never master Zarya play.
Nowhere near as much like Heavy afaik as I think some thought.
Wow that seemed like a really easy dodge of Hanzo's ult.
Didn't realise it was so slow.
I can't wait for the comments on OverHead talking about how Zarya's Gravity Kills reference is SO TOTALLY A REFERENCE YOU GUYS to Gravity Falls because that is about the level of probability on easter eggs in WowHead comments.
One of those references should be quote.
Zarya's ult p good yeah.
<- actual new footage.
HOLY SHIT THE NEW PSI POWERS LOOK GREAT.
We have Glenn as a sidenote.
Now put glenn in a bed.
Apparently we're not supposed to listen to you.
Lights are hard. That is all.
No but Edi and her friend are hard at work trying to figure out a pair of lights.
It has all the powers of a breakfast now! We must destroy it!
Yeah this show's p good.
Noelor i'm glad you like it.
!note ChaosSmurf Datamining d3 patchhas commenced.
Ina game where you are the uncle out for revenge for his niece getting killed.
You threaten the little girl.
To get at her uncle.
And at NO POINT do any of the cast members go.
Hey aiden does this remind you of this are you perhaps just a litle bit of a hyporcrit.
Well that was Shadowrun finished. Now for an intermission with Changeling that I wont participate in.
Why do you hate fun?
But the SR campaign ended with everybody alive two retirements and two marriages ^^.
Well everybody alive except the BBEG who got sliced shot attacked by a magical dog and lightningbolted.
And then still have some for monologue before finally dying.
Its the bbeg thing to do.
MoonWolf come tell me about the datamining on mumble.
<- which kind of reader are you.
I'm a selection reader.
Definitly some offense not a lot but some!
Cooked_Auto I have that comic it was the Free Comic Day one =>.
MoonWolf I just click on things I'm reading intermittently because I have twitchy fingers.
I actually do my best not to select text with it though because I'd find that distracting.
Oh o Gay marriage are legal in the entierty of the US now. Neat.
The new season of suits has started.
For nutters like me.
If I weren't all in on Steven Universe yet.
Cat Fingers would have done it.
It gets a bit creepier towards the end.
Oh that's the Akira episode.
MoonWolf that is why!
Oh hey a wrestling episode.
Yeah that was one hell of a wresteling episode.
Omg this is so wrestling.
It fits a lot of wresteling stuff in 10 minutes.
On and off here.
This image is also very relevant to SR.
So doing all the fire festival stuff got me two whole levels from 97-99.
Pleiades finale. They visit a black hole witness gravitational lensing and Hawking radiation. Still not pulling its punches.
Does anyone get punched ?
Er don't think so.
Mahou shoujos not really the punching type.
Dob what's the plan for tomorrow?
A boy on the cusp of manhood can't spend all day whackering this show.
Wtf is Onion's deal.
Mu nobody knows onions deal.
MairBear master plan got another update btw.
Spotted on Steven Universe's bedside table.
MairBear I assume so.
ChaosSmurf I was short in rep till I did the Yrel quest but yeah one daily off v.
Heroic Archimonde downed by a guild on EU-Ravencrest incidentally.
Also 3 of the top 17 are from Ravencrest seems like a good server.
TIL AMERICA IS FUCKING WEIDR.
HEY THERE I AM.
I should have lunch.
Why can't he wink.
The biggest fighting game reddit.
Straight up lesbian porn on its frontpage today.
COOKED_AUTO IS THE HOUSE ON FIRE.
Are you and a Glenny I?
Enjoying the ice/viking bar?
Yes wishing you both were here thigh.
Well you three have fun we'll be fine.
Well be home soon but I am drink.
SunTiger oh thank god its finally on BG2.
But we did it.
And then the first new party member found is just cringeworthy.
Cooked_Auto we're going to recruit so many cringeworthy ones though.
This one is going to just be middle of the pack.
True two so far.
Man this dialogue just keeps GOING.
Great a fox thief.
Great a rousing round of fuck marry kill.
Oh my god the latest update of Speedballs XCOM LP D.
ChaosSmurf you can see the weekly event things on calendar.
I CAN HEAR OUT OF BOTH EARS AGAIN.
Now we jus tneed to fix mu's ears.
SunTiger I have an appointment on uh.
Man layers make image manipulation so much easier.
...which is just as well because I just realised I hit save instead of save as.
So now I don't have a version of my facebook pic that isn't a pride flag.
To be fair I think facebok keep past versions.
Day 2 of sunnycon not as good as day 1.
Possibly the most topically-timed video Grey's ever done.
Noelor lack of sunny in sunnycon ?
On and off sunniness.
All sunshine all day here.
That is nto a 15 year old.
Proof that you be the best you gotta have the right genes.
I'm going to buy Metroid Prime Federation Hunters just to piss off salty nerds fair.
Why are nerds being salty ?
People really like Metroid Prime and found Metroid Prime Hunters mediocre at best.
Then Nintendo announces New Metroid Prime...
Salt ensued because nerds.
Could be other m 2.
ChaosSmurf if you want to laugh yourself to death you should check out the spoiler Holden just posted on Nishkriya.
So I ended up not taking any photos due to introversion despite taking a camera today specifically to take poots.
But there were some cool cosplays was my point.
Including Gogo and Honey Lemon from BH6.
Gogo was wearing actual roller blades!
MairBear I hadn't seen the apexis thing.
But I had heard it was next.
Triples all gains right?
I haven't a clue.
Noelor he's a fucking idiot.
MairBear I think that's what I read it was.
I forget who we blame so I'll default to the title.
Too busy listening to because of Archer.
MairBear TIL this is on spotify.
SunTiger isn't that for glenn?
MairBear glen is not playing gw2 though.
Fine i'll link it to glenn.
Also still can't solo MoP raids as dps monk.
What even is the point.
WoW is the worst game.
Because of that right?
Am at the endgame of long war i think.
I've got titan armor for most of the normals.
Building my first plasma weapon.
Only not researching firstorms because i lack the resources.
Endgame techs are all like 200 alloys plox.
Isn't not researching firestorms equivalent to fuck the air game?
Well you really need a firstorm to actually finish the game.
Becuase you just won't get a overseer down without a firestorm with an emp or a fusion lance.
Preferably more than 1.
I hate getting confused between British and American spellings for things.
Bored doing a highmaul raid.
I made the website prettier today feels good 3.
Also added the ability to define pluralized names for types so we don't have 'Categorys'.
Finally no more grammar abortions.
No we still have those.
I had to have a scrollbar always display even when it isn't needed to preserve my pixel-perfect alignments so I'm not 100% happy with that.
ChaosSmurf the infernal.
Congratulations to Mair on his starring role.
Maybe this'll get my countries legal services to actually tell uber to obey or get fucked.
Nah they'll keep on trying to stay in as hazy a part of the legal system as they can.
As much of a tech geek I am I still can't see myself using an uber for a long time.
I don't mind the app.
I mind the despicable buisness practices behind the app.
I have friends who uber.
But yeah it's a pretty toxic company.
So mixed a tablespoon of spirulina in a pint of water.
Water is black as sin.
Is this your green disgusto-plant?
Oh god it tastes horrible.
And whose fault is this? yours.
These videos would be funny if it wasn't for the casual homophobia |.
Wiped on the first boss of grimrail because the tank never knocked the goblin off he got to 75 or so stacks. Tanks says Ooops didn't realise this was heroic.
....the .... the tactic is the same!
You can just bruteforce it and kill them before it matters on normal probs?
You will be so lean and vascular your entire body will look like it is covered in dick skin.
I don't think anyone can heal that many stacks even on normal D.
Hooray I'm not one of these people.
I'm not the only one luckily I just don't fit a cheap pair of shorts not expensive trousers.
SunTiger Kripp turned on TTS on his stream there are some legitimately amusing things here.
Since it's his birthday and he played Darkest one of them was Mortality clarified in a single cake!
Mojang is canning Scrolls.
!note MairBear.
Boat net sucks. still alive.
Also almost didnt make it to boat.
Viking terminal nowhere near siljas one it seems.
But seriously without money silja is so much better for boating.
At least they have a working wlan.
Viking provides a faster wlan for 10e/3h.
That is to say a working one.
Aaaas still stuck on this boat for 6hours.
And running out of book.
Almost in Ã¥land. still amazed by all that land.
Don't steal my land.
GLENNY WHERE IS GLENNY.
Still 4 hours of boat to go.
I can't wait to upload my photos! We took a nice doomfoto.
SunTiger next doomholiday Amsterdam.
I need to watch NGE again.
Okay now kill 6 billion demons is just literally creating exalted characters.
My Facebook is currently full of words with far too many letters.
Some of the letters have been mutilated.
Oh man darren is a MASSIVE NERD.
Look at that face.
SGG are bro-tier.
Bought the latest Witcher book and the second DD comic collection. And paints.
Did my first Fractals in GW2.
My scrub party members kept dying on the last boss though.
We did it second attempt where at one point only I was alive and someone used a revive orb or something.
Anathema Was at GW Stockholm and had one of the redshirts throw the You want to check out new WHFB spiel at my at my first visit when I bought my Kriegers paints P.
Kinda glad GW Stockholm is decently big and not much of a one man store.
Damn I didn't think it was supposed to be out until Saturday you shoulda said yes.
Kinda hard when I left today p.
And I dont really care for Warhammer fantasy either.
This diablo patch is pretty good.
It actually features monster nerfs.
Cooked_Auto new one is reportedly terrible.
Yeah I saw the leaks. Will withhold jugdement because you know how I am with rules .p.
Not to mention I don't play Warhammer anyway.
Cooked_Auto the rules are 4 pages I'm sure even you can learn them.
SunTiger don't listen to salty nerds though wait until it is out.
Anathema well i'm not playing it any mor ethan i was playing any warhammer before.
Well if there is anything GW fans are it is salty p.
So my opninion of the system one way or the other is meaningless.
You'd get heard disease from too much close proximity to GW fans.
Nvm there was one big nerf that only high record rift runners care aobut.
So he's no longer an AOE damage wet dream.
Is there a decent primer for what actually happened in wh fantasy.
I blame the chaos gods.
Glenn yeah I came back home as well just now.
Just now how late did you end up staying in stockholm o.
Also yeah lesson for next time be sure to go to the right terminal right from the start P.
So viking line is a piece of shit if you are poor.
Like halfway through the journey my phones battery died.
No charging stations they tell me to buy a charger from tax free.
I go there I dont find any chargers only those rechargable battery packs.
I was so angry I had a pizza.
And it was a pizza from heavens.
Almost made everything else not suck.
So how tired are you now ?
Kinda fine now. I did nap on the bus.
So this kinda describes the end of the SR campaign btw. Kind of.
Also one of my art friends drew one of the character from the Changeling game thats happening.
I am listening to an AP podcast of the 1999 officially-licensed Sailor Moon RPG.
You've never had to face the full power of a Mercury Bubble Blast. Now you can't see! And it's pretty chilly! And you don't wear much so!
It'll be even chillier?
They're fighting Sailor Mercury.
Does that do anything mechanically ?
Who is the only senshi to do 0 damage with her magic.
Just like the show!
-2 to the targets' rolls.
How big is that compared to the base roll ?
Ami packs quite the penalties.
It's BESM based I think.
The room is full of bubbles!
When she was about to face Mars an NPC posed the question We'll finally see what is more powerful Fire... or bubbles?!
The Sailor Senshi don't fuse.
At least up to R.
Also why are the senshi infighting ?
Is it over men.
Its over men isn't it.
2254 evil negaverse mind control.
Well thats obviously the other reason.
Noelor mentally that just translated to majin.
So mercury is fighting Majin Mars.
Majin Mars and Majin Mercury actually.
Jadeite determined that making them fight each other would be the most evil plan and thus get Queen Beryl-senpai to notice him.
I mean they could just do something actually prodictive and evil.
But mind control is okay i guess.
Sailor Moon totally distracted me from the thing I meant to say.
SunTiger I have a family dinner tomorrow night so can't be tree sorry =<.
Ok well can't be fire either.
I guess GlennCuttlefish gets to catch up on sleep some.
I will do my best.
It's my dad's brother so should be alreet.
Okay more Steven Universe time.
I need some self control to not just finish S1 tonight >.>.
I am the voice of your lack of self control.
I need to get to sleep reasonably.
Evil Bear 2 Bearly Alive sure.
Man Lars is the worst.
Man I wish it had been remotely possible in this modern age to avoid finding out about Garnet.
Other than by marathoning the whole thing in one weekend I guess.
Who would organise all this? I know just the Gem... here's Amethyst! heh.
Steven makes bad life choices.
Oop another push back eh?
Only just realised that no game tonight. Which is possibly good. Since my brother is being driven back from the airport as we speak.
Yeah a family thing was announced to me last night.
Driven back has an amusingly unintended connotation.
SunTiger last night we did chargen for a game about post-apocalyptic mutants and I rolled a beefy four-armed woman who I called Opal and now I have the Giant Woman song stuck in my head.
2252 it's BESM based I think <--- I remember seeing that supplement when I played BESM.
Oh good all my password changes are being required at once.
Make more rpg characters.
Mairnai did you see the diablo patch notes ?
The changes will probably benefit ublock too.
But ublock naturally has a much lower performance impact.
Didn't look into it.
Someone recomendded it i tested it saw the difference and did not go back.
Tldr APB loads multiple megabytes of CSS rules per document each tab is multiple documents eg iframes.
That would explain why my firefox doesn't look like its leaing memory all over the place.
Each of these colourschemes is a document for example.
Oh god oh god.
That would fucking be the worst.
<- grace knows whats up.
A strange world we live in.
At least they are not also the world biggest vector for exploits ?
IndexedDB was proposed more than 5 years ago and has been available in IE Firefox and Chrome since 2012. Apple on the other hand didnâ€™t release IndexedDB until mid-2014 and when they did they unveiled a bafflingly incompetent implementation that was so bad itâ€™s been universally derided as unusable.
SunTiger I literally did that last night!
It's for an apocalyptic game too so there's a decent chance I'll make more.
Also right now I only had to change the pokÃ©mon with its 'dex number and line from the UBW chant passwords.
Steel is my B0dy.
SunTiger I was waiting for your reaction to that comic.
Minister what it everything you were hoping for ?
Well I wasn't sure how accurate Dan's portrayal of the system is.
I've never done it it should work.
So I thought you'd either approve or have rants.
It might not get results as quickly as you imagine.
It'll be really boring!
Does seem very Elder Scrolls though so.
One day i'll stop jumping everywhere in skyrim.
Hmm. Do I want to buy a 1TB drive or a 2TB drive. There's only a 208kr difference between the two.
Grab the extra TB.
I can't convert kroner to a currency I understand easily but yeah more storage is probs better if you can afford it.
Thats a good start to modding.
Cooked_Auto wanna trade ?
!weather remember cb24 6xj.
You forgot to make it remember your location.
I have done so in the past!
Yeah but it got wiped a while ago.
>29C I have to cycle 3 miles carrying a guitar later.
The former is how they write it the latter is how they say it afaik.
See topic if you did not already.
My subscriptions 0 are you trying to ruse me youtube.
That's what YouTube tends to do.
Cooked_Auto did you remember to log me out btw.
Right time to check out final episode of plastic memories.
I'll give it 3 out of 5 sad cats.
Not good enough to make the rest of the series worth it but if you had seen the other episodes very bittersweet.
How does that compare to lesbian princess rape simulator ?
Not really comparable tbh.
Like one was action with misery stuffed in this was romance mixed with downright heartbreaking moments.
Its a pity those were so few because it handled them rather well.
Last episode of etotama was dumb.
Then again whole series is dumb.
Where I was on holiday.
I'm not sure if my employers' LGBT support group is inept or just corporate.
Everyone welcome at LGBT group event.
Actually a 90-minute conference call in the middle of a workday.
Sweden made me realize something. I eat too much out of boredom.
Also for some reason I do feel hungrier back home.
Otoh that might just be because I ate next to nothing for the past week.
GlennCuttlefish traveling on the short term can really impact your apetite.
Well clearly I must travel more.
Just move on to the next place when I start feeling hunger.
I mean what could go wrong.
In fact I blame that pizza I had on boat.
Never trust boat pizzas.
I'm not sure why the FSN epilogue now features magical girl mma as well.
But C_A it was amazing.
Definitly didn't have that in the vn.
It was the best pizza I have ever had.
Close to the best thing I have ever eaten.
I mean I usually dont agree with food costing over 10 euros but that pizza was easily worth 14.
SunTiger that sounds amazing.
I kind of regret not sampling the onion rings while there now. But then again I was kind of worried about money so.
Excellent the new drive arrives tomorrow. Then I can install an extra fan as well.
But yeah protip while traveling by boat between turku and stockholm if you have money get the viking line. If not take the silja line.
Sadly I could not find a proper hobo cabin while on viking line. There was this one really huge space with a decent couch but the air conditioning was set to turbo.
Kirisu its only a short fight.
Somehow this ending features sakura being nice to shinji.
Behold my amazing cabin while traveling to sweden.
The place we stayed in was at a really nice location.
Couple of other pictures along that same lake.
Man that is fucking sweet.
Sadly I was always either too tired or too out of time to have a swim.
Really could have done with one after I was done with that walk.
The new tavern brawl is everyone gets webspinner decks.
Cooked_Auto I should have painted my guys in the style of the Galians from Valkyria Chronicles.
What the hell is up with this village in witcher 3.
Its full of instantly spawning fog vampires.
Like I run through the village once and 2 of them spawn behind me.
What. somehow I just died on my horse.
Unless that pit was some kind of instant death trigger.
I have had a kind of frustrating afternoon.
Trying to explain to a colleague answers to the questions what is a straight ally though.
And why should I bother?
And Do LGBTs even have it all that bad?
So I suppose they haven't done the rainbow fb profile pic.
I am going to link them the tool and see what happens.
I love this tumblr.
Game did you just seriously spawn a wall on top of me.
Wtf are you doing to this poor game GlennCuttlefish.
Running it at below minimum specs?
Noelor ofcourse i'm british i know these things.
Tonight we're out off for a meal with my dad's elder brother who still lives in the farming village where they grew up.
So I won't be wearing the t-shirt that arrived in the post today even though I really want to.
Everyone's home safe! Yaaay!
Twice as good as one edi.
Old man don't care old man is just going to keep walking.
I can relax finally everyone is home safe and the male rape center didn't need to be called after all.
Top article in my reddit this evening.
Researchers find flatworms that plunge their penises into their own heads to inject themselves with sperm.
Is that not how men are supposed to do it?
I dunno this thing doesn't come with an instruction manual.
Also I dropped a chopping board right onto my little toe.
Is that what you call yours huh fair enough.
No I call mine 'little john'.
Yeah instructions unclear stick dick in everything.
Well thats pantsu line done with. And I still dont understand what was up with the cat.
Sometimes a mysterious cat is just a mysterious cat.
Considering they are giving the rules and warscrolls away for free there is literally a 0% chance that Age of Sigmar is the only warhammer game that will exist.
Anathema or maybe they just want to sell minis.
Not like pfds are not pirated anyway.
May as well give that up.
SunTiger I will be surprised if there is no real warhammer.
Anathema so well painted!
Ts too hot already.
Real life battle scanners.
I'd like to point out the sound effect for taking off is nyanoon.
Nyanoom to be precise.
It's not fun being an elf in Warmachine. Not at all.
It's not fun being an elf <-ftfy.
True but Im reading the Warmachine writeup in the FATAL thread and no one civilization in that setting seems to have gone through as much shit as the elves.
Granted they sorta had it coming with the Hey we want our gods to live amongst us idea they got during their golden age. Result? About two Well of Eternities or so.
But unlike most other elves these are Kill all human arcanists which is pretty much Kill all humans anyway.
That's what Age of Wonders dark elves were 'Humans defiled and destroyed our perfect society and killed our king lets kill ALL of them.
Nah in this case its pretty loose because the rise of human mages happened at the same time as they went through a period of madness and bad stuff and that the magic is slowly killing their last remaining god.
So they have about eighty years to genocide all of the humans in the vague belief that it might just save them.
Sweet harddrive has arrived.
Meanwhile in Warmachine elf history the obligatory civil war between noble houses.
Grmbl seems I forgot my motivation for going outside to sweden.
Get on my level.
Well I certainly feel snubbed.
Show up CA leaves.
CA is installing a new drive.
But he did say he didn't like how much you talk about hedgehogs just before you joined.
You're not bailing on mage again are you?
I did forget about it but no I can totes play.
Oh neat ar2 relocalisation has just released its beta 2.
Free space C Terra 59.29/119.14 Â -Â D Mars 3.55/111.79 Â -Â E Cadia 35/244.14 Â -Â F Armageddon 24.92/221.62 Â -Â G Catachan 85.11/465.76 Â -Â H Krieg 24.27/74.53 Â -Â I Ny volym 1860.43/1863.01 Â -Â total 2092.56/3099.99 GB.
Minister yes also please never do that again.
Thi4f was bad enough.
We don't need Ar 2nelico.
Sadly no extra front fan the one I had was too small to be mounted without screws and those I lacked.
Now for a very difficult step.
What to name your new drive.
Oh I know what it'll be called.
Mine are currently Masser Secunda and Nirn.
It's going to take over the D position in this case because D and H will be removed.
So it'll be Mars.
All of Anathema's are called New Volume.
My non-C is Klefki =.
Except for the windows one.
Which is called Windows.
Do you name your individual organs too?
What are your kidneys called?
Left and right kidney.
You people are ridiculous.
Mine are called NOFYB and NOFYB jr.
Anathema you're one of those dirty prescriptivists.
We don't take kindly to your kind 'round these parts.
Thank god for YT Music in this case.
Yeah transfering 111gb of audio.
And my mix list is just cyberpunk synth stuff thanks to the SR campaign and the music room we used for a while >.
I am so disappointed that SunTiger isn't yelling at me for those organ names.
Minister sorry yelling for different things.
Can only yell at so many things.
You know how it is.
Kidney and fkidney obviously are the correct names.
I considered saying they were dexter and sinister.
SunTiger I just have a stricter lexer.
I can't even remember the setup for fsteak.
Shadow Teddie asked Chie about what she liked afaik.
She has to think of another kind of food she likes that isn't steak.
Fsteak was made cannon by Golden.
Not sure if that was only true in the translation or also original.
Didnt know that actually.
I wonder what the Japanese punchline was.
Minister there wasn't one the original fsteak thing was the hiimdaisy comic.
And then was references by the new golden character.
The new character no-one likes.
I will live my life in shame.
Went outside without anything on my feet.
Feet now feel like they were on a grill.
Also its 40c on our thermometer.
I need to get a USB soundcard so I can voip from my mac without having to use the built-in speaker.
Since my living room is significantly colder than elsewhere in my house.
Or just move my PC I guess.
Hmm. Man this would make such a nice phone background.
The film which he hopes to start shooting in October will revolve around an â€œinternational entertainment companyâ€ that builds a theme park based on Norse mythology. The two lead characters will be â€œbrought together in an unlikely relationship because of their mutual love for steampunkâ€. Plus the expected supernatural element and an ending â€œas horrific in its way as the.
Burning of The Wicker Manâ€. wut.
Hollywood has officially run out of ideas.
Oh that happened when they decided that Das Boot was getting a remake.
Not going for the reboot joke.
Planet hulk is the worst planet.
Should probably just deactivate the empty drives once Im done.
6.2 is meant to be the last WoD patch o_O.
Mostly because I cba to pull them all out v.
ChaosSmurf waait what ?
According to Cory Stockton.
So they either have a expansion set for next year.
In a recent interview.
Or cory is wrong.
He also made the mistake of calling 6.1 a big patch.
Or there is going to be a hell of a content drought.
I didn't even realise the storyline was finishexc.
They're not even announcing the new expansion for 3-4 months.
Seems mad to me.
6 months after release.
See you in 12 months.
We learned nothing from the last two cycles!
They're finally pulling the plug RIP WoW.
That's the bit that's weird.
Is they clearly understood the mistakes they made at the end of Panda.
SunTiger is it even six months yet?
End of November til last week.
I might still have wow time p.
Tell you what reading MMO Champion is great for news.
But the snippets of forum threads make me despair.
It's a full on pit.
I might drunkenly skype you saturday evening so sorry in advance if that happens.
Friends annual BBQ which traditionally involves lots of drinking + I'm pretty sure Sarah is gonna be there >_>.
I thought she didn't live in Cambridge anymore.
That's news to me if true.
Symphonia for PC? O.
That'll get you numbers.
Shut your dumb mouth SunTiger.
Symphonia is best Tales.
It's most of our first Tales.
That's about as far as I'd go.
Minister I just realised I didn't confirm the game status before making questionable decisions >.>'.
I can roll with -1.
I'm gonna have to be skipping this one but yeah if you can still do the game then by all means.
Anathema I thought she'd moved back to Glasgow ages ago.
Like 2-3 months after you split up.
Well let's hope I'm right.
So I don't have to ignore your skype call.
Symphonia is a fine tales but I'd say vesperia is still better.
MairBear If you want lots of character build points in TSW there is an event going on until the 8th.
Is there? Must install it again I guess.
Funcom really has no fucking clue how to make events since its just the same golem over and over again.
Unless you're in the middle of eating/travelling/whatever sure.
I mean currently only SunTiger is here so.
Don't feel rushed =P.
And i don't even play.
Well I am in middle of eating.
Anathema is probably going to copy that excuse now.
Don't do drugs people.
That gorilla did not skip leg day.
That is a handsome gorilla.
I'm jealous of his gainz.
Noelor thunder kick on page 426 is the one I was thinking off but I found the page in rules where it mentions adding damage in successful attacks so I dunno!
Noelor need to get a drink.
This picture never stops being amazing.
SunTiger game's over if you want to mumble for a wee bit.
!note MairBear Mori now has 8xp spend it on whatever.
Gaylord national hotel hee.
The shipyard just killing ships that fail 92% missions seems.
What the christ indeed.
Gamescom'll be cards from that then.
SunTiger this song is relevant to a couple articles back.
SCIENCE HAS GONE TOO FAR.
Ah that explains it.
Cooked_Auto fucking *hell* the Speedball thread right now.
I have an unreasonable fondness for this image.
Minister hey look second comic re skyim shenanigans.
He gets my vote.
Whats the worst that can happen? p.
Is that the moon from Majora's Mask?
Its a character from Nier.
Cooked_Auto everyone turns to salt ?
Well temperatures are going to be ridiculous today. I must work hard in witcher 3 to get all the sidequests done in this damned city before my computer melts.
Seriously everywhere else is mostly fine but this city is just ridiculous.
So much for that plan.
Its the humidity I don't like in this case.
I wisht this game prioritized loading quest triggers over everything else.
Guess thats the heat we'll be getting in our promised heatwave or something vOv.
One bonus with this weather strawberries. Oh good lord so much strawberries.
SunTiger did you read the commentary?
Tested for boring before the comic's creation =V.
I still feel vindicated.
Minister My answer is *scroll* *scroll* *scroll*.
VervielfÃ¤ltigung German is amazing.
Going to assume noisy vids.
Hm. trying to figure a marinade for chicken.
Soy sauce some sugar onions finly chopped lemon juice garlic sambal koriander.
The sugar is in there because i assume you don't own a sweet soy sauce.
Anathema that is a neat website!
On phone at least.
Though I haven't heard of Monogatori.
Yeah I just linked it because of the scrolling effect.
I'm impressed it looks as cool on mobile.
Nishrkiya works on mobile.
And is the same site.
Some dude just got so aggro at me in raid finder.
SunTiger could be better though!
Oh a new Blind Guardian album o.
Bootstrap3 has CSS that can automagically do the menu thing we do.
By which I meant the one that came out earlier this year v.
Do you just mean beyond the red mirror.
Love of Cartography by sleepmakeswaves.
But yes cheese is good too.
With so little space on my music drive I barely paid any attention to new albums and stuff.
This song 3.
For you poors.
Told a colleague I spent my lunch break in Facebook looking at cats and feminism.
And he asked together or separately.
So now I need to find out make an image macro set of feminist cats.
Minister you're not aware of.
But also it seems like the opposite of what I said?
Well its a joke thing.
But its the best i had okay!
Now I am not saying its warm but I think the icecream started to seriously melt in 20 minutes it took me to get home.
!weather newcastle upon tyne.
There is an NFL team.
Clearly named after the Teen Titans imo.
That sounds plausible to me.
Jeremy Soule did the music for MGS Peace Walker? O_o.
That was a departure...
Then again he also did stuff for the Pandaria soundtrack.
Grmbl I am trying to find a picture of that one painting I wanted to buy in that photography painting but no luck so far.
Which reminds me any of you lot want to give me oh about 10000 euros and a new wall?
When you live for someone you're prepared to die this kids' show.
I couldn't find an HD torrent of the whole of season 1.
I'm just streaming it.
Noelor that episode goes to some fucking DARK places.
...I am 90% sure that VHS just went into the VCR the wrong way round.
The one true sign this show is aimed for kids.
80s Opal is such a bitch =D.
My fingers are bad.
80's opal was probably also bitchier though.
Part of her was afaik some sort of tween.
Noelor the last few episodes really focus on Pearl and man.
Pearl has some Issues.
SunTiger this single second.
Noelor its a difficult concept!
She's basically allergic to it.
No more Steven Universe exists until over a week from now.
Now you have to wait.
But waiting is the worst.
SunTiger I sure am glad that situation in Gunnerkrigg resolved itself so quickly.
I have so many questions.
Nah fire's done now.
Moreso than normally during gunnerkrigg.
Back up on the roof.
Would you like to see something terrifying ?
...how terrifying are we talking here?
On a scale of one to ocean.
Its about a neckbeard.
I really want to know what the adjective is in that product's name.
Oh god that's a bag of doritos d=.
Which you may have seen from Vance if you still follow him.
Garnet sings a song about herself becomes playable in Afro Future.
Best part with that pillow? Almost sold out.
Pearl has also sang a song about herself.
There's definitely one about Opal.
Oh wait yeah so she does!
Do It For Her.
Is basically about herself.
Strong in the Way.
I also see where you're coming from on that one though.
Real way i think.
Yeah Real or Right.
I mean you could argue the theme song is about all 4 of them but.
I don't remember an amethyst song.
Someone get on that.
She's probably slightly more on-theme for AF than Pearl certainly before you learn the backstory.
Garnet is super AF.
She even has an afro.
That one is sort of easy to qualify for though.
Hm the Hearthstone music is actually pretty charming. No I haven't fallen for the trap of actually playing that tripe. I just downloaded some music rips.
I dunno CA I 'fell for the trap' but it's easy to climb out of the trap once you realise you're terrible at the game.
True but Im not much of a TCG person anyway so.
I do kinda like the odd lounge-y music though.
Folk songs turned into metal songs are amazing.
Yeah we even invented a genre for it Anathema.
This also bears 0 resemblence to the original song so far.
And is 100% the stereotypical angry shouting people expect of metal.
Yeah this isn't great folk metal.
Oh the first fucking minute was the completly incoherent introduction to the actual thing.
Sorry i mean 90 seconds.
But then also they've changed one of the central lyrics.
Which I get it's a location but.
It's also the base of the song's rhyming scheme.
Anyway otherwise it's right enough.
If you all had spotify id link the proper song.
Age of sigmar has some balance issues.
Skaven double-cheat by not getting a new unspellable name!
They seriously call dwarves Steamhead Duardin now.
Also elves are Aelfs now.
Because fuck it trademark everything.
Field n +1 fateweavers and a screaming bell.
John Oliver 2015 rickroller.
My phone says its about 25C here so I dunno.
Well you do sorta get called a cheater if you somehow roll 13 on 2D6. I mean it even says so in the book. p.
Tbh the Skaven one is almost the best new one because of all the new rules.
Like for instance if your Skaven general has one wound remaining and a chieftan with a warbanner is nearby the chieftan gets to backstab and kill the general and take his place D.
Not to mention The Dreaded Thirteenth Spell!!!
I like that all sorcerers no matter what their deal is can always cast magic missile and shield spells exactly the same way.
Before getting onto their personal spellbooks.
I mean you could see that as base spells that everybody knows like a pair of pillars or something.
You know how to defend and attack with spells? Good now lets get on with the fun stuff.
Noelor what system ?
Cooked_Auto yeah p much.
I still like it.
Also saves on the role spell 1 in every list is a slight variation on attack basic.
This morning's flat hunt went well.
Given almost every building in the area I'm looking was built on the exact same plan there's a fair bit of variation in properties.
SunTiger did you see ?
Cant remember if BL was the guy who completely flipped his shit over the latest or previous Nid codex or not v.
He seems like a THAT GUY.
*shrug* Plenty of those in the warhammer fanbase tbh so I just filter them out.
One Bat Short of a Belfry Konrad is a violent lunatic and his temper does little to help his stretched sanity. If during your hero phase you talk to Konrad von Carstein you can re-roll all hit rolls of 1 for him until your next hero phase. If Konrad von Carstein talks back to you reâ€‘roll all failed hit rolls instead.
Still not convinced this isn't an elaborate troll.
Anathema that seems like the absolute worst way to respond to that.
They could have clarified with you can only set it to legal results for that roll.
And would have still made it badly written but solved the issue.
GW are practically masters at really vague rulewording and they've pretty much gotten rid of serious playtesting root those issues out as well.
I'm just saying if you give someone a rule for rolling a 13 on a 2d6.
And then give another rule for setting a 2d6 to whatever you want.
Someone is going to do that.
Its to be expected.
Don't write rules for things you don't want to happen.
We're not ready we already fucking translated all this shit.
You've just been declinging to make money.
Noelor wouldn't suprise me.
I wonder if its fan powered.
I see you're plumbing the SA depths of tumblr.
Tumblr's one of those things I have to rip myself away from >.>.
Tumblr is a site I've never understood.
I'm not 100% sure I understand it.
Its a site where you post pictures in a blog style format and people try to use it as a blog.
But they don't care.
Ah I've attempted to navigate it but got lost and ended up on reddit.
Witcher please stop trying to drive me to drink.
But these games do have the best drinking related scenarios.
I also love that I was able to retain the tattoo I got during a drunken quest in witcher 2.
Oh gods this keeps escalating.
SunTiger oops I ended up on deviantart.
Noelor you sure did.
Oh boy time for another city visit in witcher 3.
Time to see how this game breaks today.
It rained here this morning!
Felt like Britain again.
Noelor gimme your rain.
Well it left around lunch so.
If it didn't go your way I'm afraid it must have headed toward ChaosSmurf or Edilith.
Good evening ChaosSmurf how's the stalking?
Noelor>> strange to be surprised we had rain on fri/sat when we had it on wed as well.
Well it lasted long than the previous rains.
Also I was mainly bragging.
Dob say hi to your mum for me btw.
I don't know why I wouldn't see her while she's here but y'know.
She's home for 3 wks.
Noelor I sent him a message like 2 weeks ago.
And facebook doesn't say if he's seen it but I'm fairly sure it doesn't say if they do when you aren't friends with them.
I should have bitten the bullet and just added him when I sent the message to guarantee he saw it even if it seemed a bit creepy but it was a line I didn't really wanna cross.
So I'm just hoping he hasn't used his facebook in a while.
If there's no reply it's done until I can speak to a Blizzard employee directly though.
Which would likely be next year.
Slightly less hungover now.
Thats still to much hangerover in my book.
And my phone says 27 v.
I'd love for some wind.
Needs soem sort of.
I thought i was winning.
Oh yeah Little Witch Academia 2 is out now.
So according to a friend Fiji won over Micronesia in football with 38-0.
Here is a thing.
Why are you blessing a bear?
I should be lesting a bearer.
I was not expecting FSN to have a wrestling scene.
It snot exactly wresteling.
What with the jumping and the explosions.
They're in wrestling outfits.
I classify it as magical mma.
Also standard English comment Why is Oxford in the middle of London?
Don't recall the Oxford in the middle of London part.
Don't they call it Clock Tower.
It's not anything like anywhere in London would be.
It might be a really cute episode.
Are you objecting to 'archaic uni in London' or did a part look an Oxford design copy?
But it doesn't involve resummoning saber to live happily ever after.
So its the worst episode.
Come back for the Fate remake.
They should bring me on as a consultant.
It'll be the best fate.
But HF is first and I'm hype.
HF is going to be.
Well i'm not sure wtf its going to be if you take out all the sakura is creepy and basically is addicted to your dick bits.
Also the creepy worm bits.
Basically i have no clue how they'll handle it.
The end of knights of sidonia season 2 was pretty good.
I dunno there's kinda UCL/KCL/ICL/other CL who can easily have Oxbridge-y cloister components.
Hope they renew it for season 3 and 4 and 5 and 6.
SunTiger>> that was fast.
Only launched on netflicks like yesterday.
There is no way SunTiger is watching on Netflix.
Anyway i think netflix started.
When the season ended.
I really like sidonia.
It's a valid position to take.
Its much easier to follow than the manga too.
Which suffers from serious sameface problems without colour.
I couldn't really get into Sidonia.
One thing I found solidified it for me some article posting it takes a similar path to AoT puts it in space and makes it /good/.
Thats not exactly how i'd describe it.
The s2 OP is about as hype though.
I never knew this had a fucking proper music video and everything.
Ugh I hate sundays like this.
Went for a walk in the morning finished at the pub.
Came back with a headache.
In order to fix that I've drunk so much I now have a stomachache.
Sure is an interesting track very impressive music video.
Dob is there lightninging?
Not that close there was one that went off and I was counting nearly 10 sec after.
Oh thunder's close enough for me to hear now.
I'm finally sorting through Stockholm photos!
Doing fine. Having a few beers trying to finish this %#Â¤% game.
Is your PC still setting on fire while trying to play? ...
Because it kills people.
It turned out Lyndis was my other flatmate.
Kaun is looking swish.
Bonus action shot.
Before I click on anything are there any pictures of me.
All of them are.
Well not clicking on any now.
Edilith we talked about the whole mob boss earlier.
Now calm yo tits.
KAUN SENPAII NOTICED MEEE~~.
Last one <3.
Aw yiss now there's a boss.
Can I be demoted to Hairbrusher.
You have to ask the boss.
Dont you start with that again.
Well fuck we know how that'll turn out.
Jokes is on you Glenny I actually brushed your hair in your sleep on the first night.
Jokes on you I was wearing a wig the whole trip.
I forgot how bright your hair is kaunmoth.
Anathema it's alright I forget as well.
Cooked_Auto needs to get really into guns and wear confederate patches to complete the image.
When Mr_T and I were going through the photos he was going Wow Sam is VERY orange ... VERY ORANGE.
Until some bastard takes a picture.
If I didn't take pictures how would I be able to remisce.
I'm sure Mr_T was fucking around with the settings to make more orange.
He let me have a go with his camera earlier you're lucky he didn't bring that.
Lens as long as my elbow.
Because you're tall and wear beige and caps.
Forearm.. I mean.. I don't have pointy elbows.
Did you use it in an inappropriate way ?
Don't make me explain my racism.
Kaunmoth I have no idea to what you refer to.
Cooked_Auto start lifting think of the gainz you could have.
Edilith of course not.. how's the prostate?
Thats not gonna make me much more of an interesting person anyway so who gives a shit.
Everyone at work and in my Tarek social group is particularly convinced I went to Sweden for orgies and/or bumming Mr_T.
No prostrate exams kaunmoth.
Ffs I must be hungover cannot spell today.
Edilith why else would you go to a worse country? p.
Shut your whore mouth plz.
Which is hilarious since all they kept saying was that everybody looks a lot prettier than people back home.
I SAW LIKE TWO UGLY PEOPLE IN SEVEN DAYS.
Edilith how much were you drinking?
Well its not like we didnt have an orgy at least once a night. Remember saturday? Three times!
Ed so me and who else? P.
Anathema I only drank a little bit of a lot on one night.
Who's hair did you braid.
STOP IT WITH THE FISHING YOU ARE ALL HANDSOME LOVELY FELLAS.
Because now I have to fight them.
Glenny wouldn't let me!
Don't lie to me.
I wish I was.
She did braid mine.
It feels like a joke.
That wasn't braiding kaunmoth.
I still can't sit straight.
I travelled on a plane and a train and a bus and 900 miles and made him coffee and Glenny still wouldn't let me.
Ed this way I can bait you to visit actual finland one day.
Tbh that's pretty mean.
Glenny if I come to Helsinki will you let me braid your hair.
Hysterical crying with snotting and hyperventilating.
This time I will get so upset I will shit myself.
That...That is quite upset.
Gotta make sure you know I mean biz.
I'm just gonna spam a few more links because idgaf.
Kaun also doesn't seem to have aged in 5 years.
WE ARE ADORBS.
And forgetting my own age does wonders.
Also this one we all wish we looked this badass.
Fucks sake woman there were other people there.
The orange distracts me.
LOOK FELLOW BRITONS!
Things we don't have.
You get a star.
I forgot how amazing the lake looked.
And how drunk I looked at Aifur.
Hot damn a star.
And yeah the lake was pretty amazing.
You should have come in the boat!
Or maybe Jukly Helsinki 2016.
Don't really know any places to boat on in Helsinki but there is plenty of water around here.
Speaking of Helsinki.. Glenny.
Whatchawant for Whiskey ?
Yes Glenny. Give us your mailing address.
I dont really mind. Only brand of whisky I absolutely refuse to drink is black velvet.
Of course islay is the best but everything goes.
I'd come in person but you might rat me out as an islander and get me lynched.
We need to do a Kickstarter to ship Glenny around the world.
But I dont want fame or glory.
Did you get any pictures of elk ed?
Hrm I think they were badly positioned for a photo but let me look.
Once I remove all the blurry / useless / drunk photos I can just share the whole folder.
Whut can't you book Silja without a cabin?
I was able to.
Not sure if thats only stockholm-turku however.
No doesn't look like it glenny sorry.
Grmbl too busy taking pictures of ordinary squirrels grmbl.
I have bison for sale also lynx.
And goats.. and a peacock.
I have elephants camels and donkeys.
I'll trade you my half sunken rowboat for 2 nice macro shots of mushrooms.
Damn.. there were mushrooms in the garden too.
THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT.
You're telling me SunTiger Kaun is the confused one.
Pointing at a blackcurrant bush mushrooms!
SunTiger yep with the minor change that Edilith is the confused one.
Still havent tasted marmite.
How many drugs did you do in that cabin ?
Or that other thing.
I think you had enough.
Glenny imagine eating tar mixed with sewage that's Marmite.
Aside from The Aifur Incident I was wholly sober the whole time.
It's not my fault I get high from excitement.
Well it might be good.
What kind of sewage.
You know I dont think I drank after that rum thing either.
We didn't need to! SO MUCH HYPE!
Well there was a lot to do.
And by hype I mean passively absorbing Sweden and turning it into energy like a plant.
I could have easily done 10 - 14 days instead of ~6.
And taking dumb walks along the lake.
Stupid overly large lake.
I'll let Mr_T know to add that to the Airbnb review.
Lovely house shame about the stupidly big lake.
Stupidly big really pretty lake.
Just wait till you see the photos! SO SHINY.
Rowing on it was really nice.
I would have swam in it if I wasn't a wuss.
Rowings not really my thing since my arm is busted.
I would have rowed you all around the lake and anywhere you wanted.
I wish I had had the time to go swimming.
I was this close to doing it but the spot I scouted was occupied when I returned from the walk.
I've never swam in a lake before so I was a bit scared.
But there was a jumping platform thing a little way out.
I couldn't help but imagine myself jumping off the platform and hitting my head and drowning and ruining the holiday for everyone though really.
Waterface will tell your fortune.
Why would you jump then.
Just go from the shore.
But then I might slip or something might cut my foot and get infected and I'd have to have it amputated and ruin the holiday for everyone.
Dont worry infections dont always set in that quick.
Vikingline is cheaper than Silja afaik.
This is one of my favourites of the lake.
Viking line is also dreadfully dull without money.
But by gods the pizza on that boat was so good.
Idunno last time I was on it I had no money and met this norwegian couple that gave me free cider.
Kaunmoth I still need to make that gif.
Yes you do Edilith.
Kaunmoth the couple you didn't fuck?
Kaun well yes but the thing is I dont talk to people.
You don't need to Glenny just look cute acquire free food/drink.
Ed I usually do not look cute. at least not to most people's eyes.
I mean sure once I am friends with someone that part is easier but I just dont have the puppy eyes for it before that.
Maybe if I glued some googly eyes on my face.
Maybe if you braided your hair.
Add a few cute bows.
Get on this GlennCuttlefish.
Ask ChaosSmurf he will back me up here.
He should braid ChaosSmurfs beard.
And at bows to it.
Trust me Glenny I am a scientist.
No labcoat no scientist I.
I'm wearing one right now.
And only a labcoat?
Sure yeah whatever.. so long as you believe that I am a scientist.
Hmm I'm staring at that group photo posted earlier and bewildered trying to put names to faces.
But it's fine because you don't wanna see one of me.
Right thats enough witcher for tonight.
Dismounted from my horse and fell to my death.
Did you phase through the world?
No fell of a rooftop.
To which I got to by jumping off a mountain.
But on my horse so it was fine.
Man the second last episode of mad men is depressing as /fuck/.
Oh god yes rain.
Wait..This game has traps?!
I swear to gods whatever is at the opposite end of this spike maze better be bloody amazing.
Because the controls are NOT suited for navigating this thing.
Time to uninstall this time vampire.
Saw a girl on tinder last night who had bigger arms than me one of her pictures had her doing what looked like a 100kg shoulder press o_0.
Might have just been 60kg hard to tell if there was 1 or 2 plates per side.
More gains than you.
The things you find in your online drives.
SunTiger extremely so I took a screenshot but it seems it didn't upload so I cannot show you.
But I was envious.
With the rules for Josef Bugman +1 Bravery if I'm holding a drink the Thane with Battle Standard reroll any failed hits if I have a bigger beard than my opponent and Longbeards bonus rule for the unit if I complain in a suitably Dwarfish manner about how things used to be better it looks like showing up to an Age of Sigmar tournament unshaven drinking from a hip flask and.
Complaining about how AoS sucks compared to previous editions is no longer a tournament faux pas but actually a viable tactic.
Warhammer players do not need more encouragement to be unhygenic.
I dont see any mention about going there unwashed p.
Also no disrespecting dwarf player would go anywhere without having done proper beard maintenance. Because that would be disrespectful.
What about female dwarf players?
Female dwarves without beards? Now you're talking rubbish here.
Grab eyeballs. Get Ninjas!
The ninja gets anticlimactically one-shot by the grenade launcher.
I expected something worse.
D D D.
Can't be that baNOPENOPENOPE.
Now I remember why I stopped my playthrough of ps3 vesperia.
Got to a new town and now I am obsessively checking online for missable things.
Why would there be agony vesperia is the best tales of game.
Well I meant agony of grinding. Or something.
<- this article is really good.
New onenote for mac update.
If you think your life contained an insufficient amount of purple have we got the setting for you!
Onenote does love its pinks and purples.
Probably because all the other office apps stole the good colours.
>besmirching the good names of pink and purple.
Look right nothing wrong with pink and purple per say.
But its not green or red is it.
SunTiger I'll pretend you didn't say that.
Mm home made mince.
Making minced meat and the subsequent dinner I've found out that I've poked myself in the eye too many times with the chillies I normally use that it's stopped burning.
I've accidentally trained myself towards pepper-spray immunity.
I just had fish and potatoes. Well salmon and potatoes I guess.
Nothing wrong with Salmon and new potatoes in the summer.
Sadly not new potatoes just potato wedges.
1243 what about female dwarf players? <- they have to bring a really tall boyfriend who they're with only to convince their parents they're not lesbians.
Cooked_Auto that's proper adorable =3.
Your skype avatar skavatar? being the Evangelions has put Cruel Angel's Thesis in my head.
Has a nice ring to it.
Oh yeah I was going to change that one.
Right time to read tihs ChaosSmurf article.
Not Honk Angel's thesis I.
I had that open from playing....that one fighting game with a reallly stupid name.
These people are not even TRYING to use the walkways.
Have you seen the actual crossing?
Yeah no one really gives a damn about walkways in real life either.
Thats not how you road.
I can't think of an RPG released after FF7 that I've played that has better levelup or turn based combat mechanics apart from perhaps Paper Mario 2 ahahahahahahajajawhat.
He must not have played very many.
Noelor>> what have I done this time?
Your skype avatar skavatar? being the Evangelions has put Cruel Angel's Thesis in my head.
Well that's what you get for logging in to skype.
GlennCuttlefish I wasn't expecting actual lyrics.
Also I'm sure that's been my skavatar for a long while now.
ChaosSmurf you sure got Dark Soulsed.
He just had trouble seeing in the dark due to backlight from the sun.
CS was streaming darksouls 2 last night.
And died to a hole in a bridge.
Just walked into a hole in a bridge.
Oh hey little witch academy is out.
Noelor I don't know if you care to read it.
But an LP of FFIX just started.
I still havent gotten used to how different the voice direction seems in the japanese vesperia.
I think the T40s did an episode with the japanese VAs.
But I've forgotten any particular differences.
...I think it was the T40s anyway.
Maybe it was the other group of drunkards LPing things.
Some drunk people did a VLP a while back.
Going to say it english yuri > japanese yu ri.
The VA in english vesperia was amazing all round really.
Release on pc plx.
Bamco hates western money.
They miiight release it on PC.
If everyone buys Symphonia.
You know the worse game.
Ff7 is getting a remake too.
Symphonia was actually really good imo.
Yeah I have fond memories of Symphonia.
Look FF7 remake was inevitable.
How is that saying anything.
Adecor why do you always look like you have a ballgag.
FF7 remake is a huge risk tbh.
How is that ki..HOW IS KINKSHAMING EVEN A THING.
How does anyone have the nerve to shame people for their kinks.
Easily if they dont keep it to themselves.
What if their kink *is* not keeping it to themselves?
Noelor then they are inconsiderate.
Then they might be a furry from the early 2000's.
I mean I was just thinking exhibitionists but.
Well exhibitionists are inconsiderate!
Also get off on getting kinkshamed.
Thats sort of their thing.
Noelor why do you hate exhibionists.
I was asking why you did.
But clearly you do if they get off being kinkshamed and you seem to imply kinkshaming is bad you hate their kink and since their kink is the whole issue you are hating on exhibionists.
Giant Robots are Japanese Culture.
Thank you for keeping me company in that Dark Souls stream yesterday btw SunTiger.
You doing more tonight or not.
MairBear I got the mount drop from the rare spawns.
Hebocon is THE BEST.
That wolf was easier than I expected.
Maybe you remember the wrong wolf ?
You know the wolf I am talking about in vesperia moonwolf.
Its been a long time.
No i don't remember the wolf i think.
SunTiger the one in the forest. The one also in the demo.
SunTiger I lied soon.
He's harder in the demo than the regular game.
You probably remember the demo one ?
Not by much from what I remember.
Main reason is you cant restock wares in the demo I think.
But I didnt do that now either.
The boss is easy once you understand how enemies attack in this game.
So just keep running in circles.
Also if you just limit break and kill the cubs asap.
Related to that.
ChaosSmurf how did you use sort've instead of sort of in exactly the opposite of the way most people get it wrong?
The cutest creepy girl.
Dob Fun fact after the colossal success of Kantai Collection the developer pushed out a ton of anime characters as historical X clones including one about samurai castles. The only other one to attain any commercial success is one aimed at women I think? that's full of attractive men personifying famous historical katanas. Also apparently that thing is really popular in China.
Who doesn't like anthropomorphic katanas y'know?
Hey baby wanna see my sword.
No. I meant Kancolle.
Chinese ladies like boats.
I'm half asking the question why does it have to be me targeted with those pts all the time.
But then I guess I brought it on myself.
You're the KanColle person now.
And yes you did brought it on yourself.
Meh boats before goats man.
What is the goat in this idiom?
Should've gone with Boats before brethren.
Well it's like bros before hos so you wanna keep the rhyming but hoats I don't think is a thing.
Kind of a cheat rhyme.
Probably going to get Black Closet when it comes out.
Who wants possible card leaks.
Nobody currently in this channel but me.
To the note mobile.
!hs note MairBear.
MoonWolf did you realise you didn't actually note Mair?
Thats a fucking shot and a half.
Keeper never saw it ocming.
Got pretty close to it too for the distance.
That is not 1-bit.
What would 1 bit even BE.
Literally only 0xffffff and 0x000000.
Assuming they are talking about colours.
So there is now a loli in this murder dungeon as well. Just hanging around.
Loli pirate has joined the party.
Wait not officially yet it seems.
Welcome to the ps3 version.
Enjoy your loli but not really and possibly a man from the past pirate.
A loli who is also possibly a manly pirate is fine too.
She's mostly annoying and her skills are too random.
Fi is more like Pearl than Garnet imo.
There was some feeling that the overall on-line community is far more likely to take an open slate like Beast new concept with deliberately twisted up themes read into it their pet ideological conflict and go berserk with outrage this year than any other point in history um.
Your tv license money at work!
Well I can think of plenty of worse uses for tv tax.
Its not a tax!!!!
Look its a mandatory government pay off its a tax.
It's something we *should* be funding from taxes.
That's why it isn't a tax.
If it was a tax the bbc would LOOSE ITS INDEPENDENCE.
I'd rather they give pi's to children than half the junk they pay broadcast licenses for.
Its not? I envy you brits.
I'll never pay the license fee for instance.
Sorry i'll stop being a bbc idiot.
We changed the yle fee to yle tax a couple of years back.
Anathema I'd rather they gave pis and good compsci ed to young kids than most of what taxes go into too.
In other news I no longer think of the 90s as 'a decade ago'.
Because thats just wrong.
It's about a yandere lesbian couple.
MoonWolf I just realised my company sells commodities trading software and te GW2 market is basically commodities trading p.
Yet another thing classic Opera already had.
Anathema yeah it basically is.
MoonWolf I'm gonna see f I can write an app to replace the manual excel stuff my friend used to do.
And CS is now published on playboy.com.
Not gonna click that at work.
Nothing racy on the page but yeah thats why i linked the tweet.
Apparently Bones 3 has already reached $266077 and the goal was $30000 with 18 days to go.
The bones goal isn't a goal.
Its just an arbitrary nice looking number.
Wearing my Mean Girls referencing pokÃ©mon t-shirt listening to the Sailor Moon Crystal theme off to rp.
Good end to the day.
Should probably do some more wedding writing later today unless I get roped into golem hunting.
Does not have eyepatch is not a robot 6/10.
Is not your dad.
Someone just walked past me with a huge å®¶ on the back of their jacket.
Is it just me.
Or does Power feel like it should be older than it actually is?
The Kanye West song? eh dunno.
Phone network internet blind spots on this bus route include near the train tracks.
But yes the Kanye song.
I had no idea FE had Waterbenders.
Ah seems like its going to rain tonight. How nice.
Wait are those pretty much Starcraft marines? p.
Closer to space marines than sc marines.
Oh new Overwatch hero.
Yeah i have no clue what their deal is at gamescom.
Before the HS announcement scroll thing i explained in detail to CS i thought it was going to be the new hs thing.
But that is at the 22nd.
I really have no clue what they are doing there.
Clearly they have biggu newsu for that.
Maybe more new heroes.
Thats basically the whole game GlennCuttlefish.
And thats why its the best tales of game.
There is literally not a weird situation you are in that you can't make less awkward by going to the closest bar/teahouse/pub/whatever else and demanding a drink.
What if its an AA meeting.
Nobody said it had to be alcohol.
But who in their right mind would go to a bar pub whatever and order not alcohol.
Cooked_Auto for how long we've known each other you sure walked face-first into my sarcasm on Twitter there =P.
Pshaw you were clearly wrong in your assertion and I saw the need to correct your mistake I.
Besides it's like you've done the same before p.
Also it illustrates the point that even your names are better than the ones GW chose.
You forgot the steamhead part btw.
For the trademark.
Oh the Overwatch character was even a new one. Huh.
>It ends when the witch throws the soccer mom through a plate glass window divider we had in the front office.
Why did I know what was coming even if its my first time hearing about them.
Someone decided to play this during last saturdays Arma 3 session during a mission. We didn't get to step outside the base before we found a bunch of AI waiting for us. We interpritated that as they had heard the music and really disliked it.
Babymetal is the best.
We were pretty much laughing over the whole thing.
I mean we realized it happened because of someone driving a car around and getting spotted by the timing of it all was so perfect.
Amusingly the choice of music for that is thanks to one of the players scottish roommate who was playing it loudly and made the guy wonder just what the fuck he was playing.
When did crunchyroll start carrying lewd stuff.
Wait how lewd are we talking here+.
Is it ecchi or are we talking the full on tentacle?
Also did you know that the monstergirl manga seems to have gotten an anime adaptation.
And at least this didn't have the k-18 prompt.
Unlike that other show on croll.
Known about that one for a while.
Which shouldnt really surprise anyone.
Also first episode of My Monster Secret is out. Kinda slow but I know the thing will pick up later if it follows the manga.
Good grief Reaper 3 is already at 532k.
Well that balanced on lewd and cute better than I expected.
Well that monster only took all of my life bottles.
This time I ran into the pirate loli in some monster infested forest.
She sure gets around huehue.
Wait I have to fight WHO now.
Gigantomonsters fine but fighting don whitehorse? Nopenopenope.
Please let this be one of those fights you cant win.
He is 30 levels above me has 3 times more HP than anything I've fought so far. In a group. This is a solo fight.
Xenonauts is the spiritual successor to XCOM original right?
Or is it actually one of the originals?
Its meant to be seen as a spiritual successor to the first XCOM game in this case.
Also if anyone fancies a £3 €4 I guess? Platinum game Korra's 75% off on Steam.
Enemy within/uknown are modern interpretations of the original xcom games.
Xenonauts is a modern game that tries to aproach the oldschool gameplay.
To a certain point its airgame techtree etc are very different.
I was mainly checking it was the game I thought it was.
Because it showed up in my Steam queue and I wasn't sure at first.
Tonight we played Mutant Year Zero.
It is a post-apocalyptic game.
Which means it's Ana's sort of game gritty high stakes people aren't supposed to be happy.
Would you like to know what we got up to?
Dying horribly for trying to do stuff ?
We rescued a baby from cultists and then from hypothermia adopted her and heralded her as the dawn of a new age.
Then set up an underground wrestling circuit.
I'm not sure why you need it to be udnerground in the post apocalypse.
BECAUSE THE BABYMANIA IS ABOUT TO HIT THE WASTELANDS BROTHA.
As opposed to underground.
I let our bard I mean Chronicler but she's a bard name the baby.
Because otherwise I would have just made another Steven Universe reference.
My own character being a giant woman with four arms and a spear called Opal.
Noelor tonight we played Mutant Year Zero - Funny enough that's an English translation of a classic Swedish RPG line.
Doesn't opal have a bow.
My Opal is a melee so she just has a spear.
I prefer it's predecessor more. Which dealt more with a post-apocalyptic industrial revolution and such.
Which she drove through two people in a single swing tonight.
Cooked_Auto we've been instructed to read none of the surrounding lore/metaplot/whatever.
So as to keep ourselves fresh for what the GM has in store.
Yeah I don't know anything about the Year Zero metaplot or anything.
I mostly know about stuff from the older game Heirs to the Apocalypse.
Which did have English Badgers in kilts.
If I remember right.
But the game was mainly set in middle Sweden and the Pyrit community.
I just had an idea for one of those storytelling games. In the spirit of baron munchausen you tell the ever increasingly ridiculous tales of how you survived the apocalypse.
Pretty sure there is a game based around that already.
Well at least increasingly exaggerated storytelling at least.
Well there is a baron munchausen game that is just about telling ridiculous tales.
Which I still want to play dagnabbit.
Im sure you'll get your chance someday.
There are times I wish gdocs let you do a second document page inside another one as a tab so I could offload story scraps and other notes there without having to clutter up the main document with them or use unnecessary page breaks /.
MoonWolf do Dark Souls enemies usually have as little feedback when stabbed as these gargoyles I'm watching Smurf fight?
No the gargoyles are bosses and bosses care much less about getting stabbe.
I mean I get not giving many fucks but.
Just no reaction at all feels meh.
You can stagger them.
But it takes quite a bit.
I painted my toenails.
Then realised I have no idea how long I need to let them dry.
Unrelated I only noticed today that my WoW subscription ran out.
But apparently it's been inactive since February.
This seems way too long.
S'alright you've not missed much.
Cute looking at the upcoming F1 2015 and noticing parts that are already entirely invalidated.
Forbidden Digimon Love.
Part 2 of the latest Laundry Files novel is titled 'The Sorting Algorithm of Evil' D.
MoonWolf you know of any stylish scripts that makes rpg.net non-awful?
I just don't go there.
Unfortunatly they have useful GM tips.
Oh well guess I'll write my own.
I need to do one for dakkadakka too.
Tried pvp last night in gw2.
MoonWolf so on the list of countries for nishkriya usage USA is top with 324 guess what the next highest is.
This is only the past 24 hours.
Wait was i right ?
I expected uk or canada.
Checking for the past week now.
I really like Azure.
Ok Canada is second now.
United Arab Emirates above Germany.
Game is still on for tonight right?
I dont like short people jokes they always go over my head.
But everybody knows that Short People got no reason to live.
If they think they're oppressed they should try being ginger.
What if you're ginger and short?
Cooked_Auto shut you tall freak.
I'm just realous really.
Dad and grandad are 6'3 I am barely 6'.
Oh god that hairstyle. 3.
Anathema 6' is the opposite of short.
What are you even.
Oh I'm not short I know.
And I said barely.
I'm really more 5'11 p.
Get off the short people refit!
I think I am fortunate in that being obese and too short I can make fun of both groups without feeling too bad. Its like getting to have my cake and eating it too or I would if somebody hadn't put it on the top shelf.
I almost spilled all the coffee in the kitchen just now.
So you didnt in fact spill it?
Onto myself and the floor.
Well thats no good.
Get on the floor do the the dinosaur.
Oh yeah I was going to download all Lip Sync battle episodes because why not.
Social Network -> SocNet?
Think I'm going to try to make it happen.
Creating your own mindworm?
That's Mantics reponse to the new statue outside GWs main office.
I've not heard of them.
But it seems a bit pathetic.
Kinda yeah somewhat childish.
Both as a statute and as a... joke?
The former is obviously intentional.
If you're still my biggest fan.
Those leaks look cool.
ChaosSmurf sec and i'll tune in.
Nvm tour is over.
So lodge-ee low-gee low-guy low-jie log-ee maybe even -ih phonic?
Watching Lip Sync Battles is a sheer delight.
MairBear it is a good brawl.
Mumble so i can brawl you ?
Multitaskings but maybe in a shortly?
I'll just be spying on you.
You've got a lot of cards that are not spells.
MoonWolf that was pretty bad for me huh.
Loathb worked against me D.
Loatheb is a pretty good include in this brawl.
Not if they get malygos V.
MairBear you found a place where recycle is a good card.
You need a flamestrike.
This is going to hurt.
Nef wouldn't give it for free though c.
I think you win.
I'm not sure how this mage had no damage in hand.
I was expecting two fireballs to the face for lethal.
Velen on board and it does NOTHING.
That repentance so hurt c.
So I dont understand the pricing for this bread.
Therefore it must be good.
A pack of about 200g costs me 1.75 euros.
Is it gluten free?
But a pack that has 400g worth of bread in it costs 1.8 euros.
I dont think so.
Wonder if I can rig my PS3 to my sound card so that I can use headphone surround.
I'm going to take my contacts out and retrieve some quiche then open the various required windows and applications.
Look at that raven.
Reception in these woods.
GW stares at Mantic with disbelief. Do you really think making troll posts is going to help you look professional enough for that bear to want to play your game instead of eating you? it asks.
GW and Mantic are walking in the woods together when suddenly they see a bear looking for a new miniature wargame to play. GW immediately destroys its 30-year-old setting and releases a new game with terrible rules and fake space marines in hopes of enticing the bear to pay $125 for a starter set. Mantic on the other hand pulls out its smartphone and begins trolling GW on Twitter happily Mantic has good 4G.
I don't need to look completely professional replies Mantic. I just need to look more professional than you.
Well erm that sure is a retelling.
A gw social media presence? haha that's cute.
Monster musume wholesome family entertainment.
Not even the stupidest ecchi this season.
My Wife is the Student Council President.
I mean there was that stu.
That girl wins the vote for president.
But thats more ero than ecchi I think?
And then it turns out she's been sent to be the protagonist's wife.
Which for some reason was uncensored on CR.
There is both a censored and uncensored version.
The censored version has a bizarre unrelated puppet theatre instead of the ero scene.
MoonWolf ! Reborn.
Shounen mango titular character is the baby in the trilby.
Gate opening cinematic commencing with a letter G shown twice once inverted.
Don't like where this is goin.
Right that's the one I keep thinking of.
MoonWolf that trailing hyphen though.
Note to self Trying on blue goggles crashes the game.
Would have been nice if I had remembered to save at the party switch on boat before trying costume options.
Trying to think through my stance on the monopolising of memes original use - cultural elements.
Example saying nigger is acceptable only if you are black like I feel weird even having typed it.
It's an our word.
And like queer is heading that way and part of me likes that but also it's a bit awful?
Because obviously it's just one aspect of the whole othering thing humans do.
I have literally no awnsers to this.
We'd need a new initialism to mean non-cis non-hetero people then because we all know everyone needs a label.
Sugar is corrosive to the blood vessels just ask any nurse whoâ€™s pushed dextrose 50% into an IV and watched the vein blow and over time even moderately high blood sugars rip and scar your arteries and veins.
A few years of sticky scratchy sugar blood and the nerves die from poor circulation wounds stop healing because no blood is getting to them and eventually your legs just rot off.
Broken-down proteins and fats produce ketones. Starving cells produce lactic acid. Between those two and all the extra potassium your blood turns to acid in your veins.
Minister Mage on tonight?
I'm almost at the end of the first session in my attempt to write it all up*.
You are very thorough in write-ups then.
Minister how goes hearing ?
I think the buff has worn off by now.
MoonWolf I dropped my pen and it was as though the gavel of almighty Jehovah was calling for peace.
Blaxsploitation Thor. Amazing.
What the hell Vader?
Lots of rpg playing going on today around me my brother is playing CoC then there's mage here and changeling on skype.
Darth Vader not a nice dude.

I shouldnt be watching Lip Sync Battle while eating dinner. Laughing and grinning too much D.
Oh god the LSB episode with Steven Merchant is amazing.
MoonWolf that thing is tonight.
The baldur's gate thing.
Latest Laundry Files novel has a VTOL submarine powered by the souls of tormeted porpoises D.
Don't read the comments even more than that usually applies.
Cooked_Auto dyk if there's a Steven Universe OST out there somewhere with all the song?
Or am I going to have to work out how to rip an mp3 from youtube.
Well the latter isn't that difficult but I can take a look.
Well yeah more a hassle than actually difficult.
But I need Giant Woman and Stronger Than You on my phone basically.
And probably Pearl's songs too *I guess*.
I cna give you one of those.
I can give you this as well.
What time were you planning on starting mage?
Half past depending on when Ana/Janos show up.
Spotify changed their shade of green my life is turned upside down.
Take a mi- nah.
Also I'm as good as around toda.
So 3 for you I guess.
Yeah i'll be in bed.
Coverages in the morn.
RPS have a guy there but I assume so will anywhere else you care to read.
Eeyup welcome to russia.
MoonWolf haven't loaded VS on my desktop in ages decide to update Azure -> 21 items to install D.
Hm. I should have stocked up on whisky after all.
Oh. That's neat.
Well thats certainly things happening in Poppy noelor.
I just fear poppy will go full end of akira now.
Releases the muscle restriction level 0.
Blowing a chunk out of the moon as a prelude a city destroying cataclysmic psi battle ?
Well kinda the joke is that we have never seen poppy's full muscle mass.
And it might go into full flesh abomination if this keeps up.
So this one appears to be high-schoolers running SpaceX. While on Mars.
Anime as a medium as become unable to portray any situation as anything but a highschool setting.
And the oldest a chracter could viable ever be is like 20.
I just watched a new anime where that didnt mostly happen.
Their collection of flags of nations who have colonised Mars includes San Marino New Zealand and Greece. Apparently Greece survives these funtimes.
BwaS escaped their countries crippeling debts on mars.
Rev up those mystery hype machines.
This alone makes me want to get back to ff14.
Anathema no mage next week btw because Dob's graduation is next Thursday and he's invited me to the pursuant fancy meal.
Why is the first jojo's bizzarre adventure theme so good.
I don't entirely know.
But it so is.
Cant decide if its the greatest or second greatest anime theme.
What's its competitor for you?
Ai wo torimodose from hokuto no ken.
Also the french hokuto no ken is pretty amazing.
*hokuto no ken OP.
That was not what I had expected.
<- have the main waifu getting drunk.
Sadly the torrent I found for that had a terrible ratio.
MoonWolf and I have decided it's neither symphonic nor metal.
Last night at around half five ie when everyone had basically gone home already it was emailed out to all managers that all Fridays are now casual Fridays.
Our team's manager's manager our actual manager being off sick forwarded it this morning with the below addendum.
I got this last night not in tune for everyone to adhere to today so I have not dressed down either.
Anyway I find that pretty precious.
You on the other hand are going to show up in pajamas and a bathrobe.
Finally managed to get myself back up to a full 5x5 60kg bench press yesterday managed it before my holiday but not since I got back.
They've specifically banned shorts for some reason not that I was terribly likely to wear mine.
So I'll be showing up in jeans a pokÃ©mon t-shirt and a button shirt.
Minister that is sexist.
Yeah i'm not seeing the sexism in banning shorts.
They also banned jeans with more holes in than denim and sports strips even Tottenham Hotspur!
MoonWolf I bet women are allowed to wear skirts.
Yes but and bear with me as I patriarchise only respectable length skirts.
Also implicit no skorts.
Wtf is a skort?
Omg how do you not know this.
Are men allowed to wear sandals?
If not are women?
It's shorts and a skirt combined into a single practical sporty garment.
Nobody is allowed sandals.
Not quite as sexist as Cambridge Assessment's dress policy then.
What CA's policy probably says is just no sandals.
And then ladies ignore it.
I don't think so people explicitly asked about smart sandals and shorts for men in summer and were told no.
Specifically asked about men because women were allowed to wear them.
Part of that is that smart sandals and shorts.
Is a category of things that doesn't exist.
My sandals are smart.
I didn't realise they were *leather*.
Obviously that makes them smart.
Leather is the most formal of all materials.
Minister here i tought black cotton was the most formal of materials.
Well according to Anathema it's leather.
I did not say any such thing.
And besides I wore brown trainers all the time and no-one complaiend these but not hi-tops and brown to be precise.
Not being able to wear shorts and sandals at work is legit one of the reasons I left CA.
A true IT guy.
I don't even own sandals.
But its actually factually true.
MoonWolf I was the same until I got my current pair but they are so comfortable.
MoonWolf a couple of those were alright but mostly it seemed like weird biases and a heavy dose of toxic heteronormativity.
Defintily the last thing.
Just when you thought it was safe to get out of the water....
Minister welcome to metal re toxic heteronormativity.
I dunno about toxic.
And it was more like.
Omg that metal sub-genre likes pink what a giiiirl.
Hey babymetal is pretty rad.
I mean come on grow the fuck up.
Baby metal isn't a thing.
Granted its more a band than a genre but still pretty rad.
I can accept that it is a band.
Hey if you want girly music I have plenty of pop for you.
I have plenty thanks.
Cooked_Auto I don't see how babymetal are in any way a counter to claim that metal is filled with toxic heteronormativity.
But also yes please.
Then there is always Ladybeard.
Metal is more full of toxic guitaronormativity.
Minister you take that back.
Guitaronormativity is not a thing no matter what tumblr tells you noelor.
Clearly the only true music is beeps and bloops.
GlennCuttlefish if anything is guitaronormative.
Sure but its not a thin.
That is the best drawmeme.
I nearly died of laughing.
We need drum only metal.
Drum solos all the time.
But its not going to be metal at that point.
But it'll have double base so of course it will. I mean clearly to combat the dominance of guitars in the genre the rules must be changed.
Now who's not guitaronormative GlennCuttlefish hmmmm?
Minister I would be IF IT WAS A THING.
That goddamn pool.
Unrelated the ice cream van hasn't been round while I've been out here for lunch.
Gonna buy some bru I guess.
For you that feels really off.
Speaking of drums. I should download Sepultura's Roots album.
...I'm not okay because I want ice cream?
I usually associate bru with irn bru.
Oh god that Velma 3.
Was that adam jensen cosplaying Gendo?
I dont think so.
I mean I cant say for sure but Im somewhat sure that isnt the case.
I highly doubt it too it just popped into my head.
Anathema if a leg garment covers down to somewhere on the mid-shin do you call that long shorts or short trousers?
Minister I would say long shorts but I'm sure there is a proper name.
Just wondering if you consider them further cheating vs the no shorts rule.
Which sounds like yes!
Are they banned or allowed?
Well shorts are banned.
But there are ladies wearing capris.
I return with more clothing to wear.
I really should buy new shoes at some point before mine really gives up >_>.
But not sandals. Have a pair of those already.
If its weather for sandals its weather for nothing at all on my feet.
We literally had a discussion on the last two weeks about that being painful for your feet in fact.
No I meant walking around barefoot.
I mean sooner or later while walking around barefoot outside you will come upon a place that is not nice to walk on.
Or maybe MoonWolf is one of those people who like barefoot running and use those latex covers.
Damn that's one helluva changelog.
Oh the latest Lip Sync Battle episode is Allison Brie versus Will Arnett.
19 year old scottish kid did not want to pay extra for his luggage decided to WEAR ALL HIS CLOTHING.
Passes out on a plane because he was wearing 12 layers of clothing.
Sure sounds like a Scot.
MoonWolf when's the Stevenbomb again?
Should t starting tomorrow or something ?
Ughhhhhhh I'm so bad at everything.
What does backspace do? ...oh WE TOLD YOU NOT TO PRESS IT.
Why is a wombat that large.
I have a pretty important meeting tomorrow with a mortgage advisor.
Totally forgot to email myself my payslip.
ChaosSmurf I want my journalism now.
GlennCuttlefish So according to some friends a guy burned down a GW store in Finland confirm/deny?
He just burned a few millions dollars worth of plastic.
Nevermind it's a shop.
So watching xmen days future fuckup the timeline blink can create portals wherever she pleases.
And what's on one end of the portal is there as proven by the sentinel losing an arm when she closes them.
Why doesn't she just fucking open up a ton of portals and spread them all across the place?
Open a portal at around the midsection of a sentinal.
Because that would make sense.
Midsection neck height they had no issues running into the portals.
Even if only the smallest bit of actual material is removed that way.
You still just cut it.
Or just funnel the sentinels which are so keen of pursuing into an endless portal loop until you're far away.
Blink needs to learn to Think With Portals.
Chell get cake afterwards.
That or take lessons from Yugo.
Or take a portal to Spaaaaaceeeee.
C_A havent heard of it.
It was fake anyway.
So.. AngryVideoGameNerd has now finally run out of games?
Update once a month or twice but it's a let's look at and compare to ye olde days or a guest star.
Nah just too much effort to make new stuff.
So I was supposed to watch the rest of that dungeon anime.
But somehow I have ended up semi-marathoning re-kan instead.
MoonWolf you should check out PoE 2.0 so many changes.
The internet finally got what it wanted. nsfwish.
Oh no. Longshoreman X is back for revenge!
This #Â¤!Â¤ secret mission.
<- this isn 't a gun that fits in a suitcase the suitcase IS THE GUN.
The best kind of suitcase.
Well I mean it's objectively pretty bad at being an actual suitcase.
But sure other than that.
Noelor it only needs to look like one.
The stated purpose of a suitcase is to be a case for one's suits.
And that gun has no storage space for suits in it.
It is probably a very good gun but objectively a poor suitcase.
Hah SciSchow made an episode titled Why are GMOs Bad? the content of which is They're not.
And then ten more minutes of actual info.
Ok decided to finish FF6.
Loaded last save state found myself in the middle of a fight against a samurai.
When killed he gave me a relic that lets the holder attack 4x.
I turned Odin into Raiden.
This definitely makes sense.
Ancient nordic god turned into a sword weilding cyborg.
Well it kind of does.
His summon went from Zantetsuken to Shin-Zantetsuken so... sure.
So what does the shin mean ? bigger ? better ?
Something along the lines of bigger.
Shin-osaka is the larger of osaka's trian stations iirc.
Usually see it translated as true in pop culture.
That makes sense too.
Watching a blind LP of Ocarina of Time.
Just answered the very important question Is Darunia a horse?
What is he then ?
Ah the best xcom multiplayer match got posted.
I saw most of these stramed.
This one is nice.
If long.
A warrior killed my mad scientist.
I got mirror entity.
He had already queued up grim patron and whirlwind.
So I get 2 patrons from him and havve exact lethal.
This is why if you can half manage it.
You should always WAIT.
To see wha thappens.
I can only imagine he was thrown off by my first secret being spellbender.
Grmbl trying to make this webm file 1 proper size 2 understand its supposed to have subtitles is proving unreasonably difficult today.
Wait not size quality.
Fun fact - Before EMS was a thing ambulance services were often operated by by your local funeral home. No medical equipment or training. Just an attendant to scoop you into the back of a hearse.
The Lego Comic on set.
Oh my god when will my stupid callouses come back.
If you ever wanted to watch me be bad at PoE now you can!
Anathema your pretty bad.
I'm your only viewer.
Also your sound is broken.
Hmm I'm using PoE's built in thing.
Is it even possible to burn subtitles directly into webms.
Or do I have to first create another source file for this.
Well yeah just make them part of the video.
Webm is not a container file like say mkv.
Thats what I have been trying to do for a while but not sure what I am doing wrong.
So you can't include a text based subtitle.
Right so my source is a mkv file I can extract the subtitle file from that but it wont work then?
It won't have subtitles.
You'll need to render actual video with subtitles if you want them included.
So what I just said above.
Start googeling render subtitles to video.
Pretty sure I can do this part without google at this point. Maybe. Lets see.
Well this episodes bathing shenanigan turned out different from what I've grown to expect.
But I should have known with this series.
Well that final episode was better than I was willing to expect from this series.
I think it was because the music was used to great effect in this one.
Also the dumbest anime sword I have seen in a while.
1826 Why yes I'll accept this quest. - YouTube <- I don't understand how this person can be using sexymap and some sort of HUDbars but also have default unitframes and actionbars.
MoonWolf omg the mimetic skin-off.
Noelor it was pretty funny live.
Meanwhile in nier threads even more people are worried that nier 2 might actually have good gameplay.
And that would be HORRIBLE.
I love blacker spork.
I mean I feel like this is a valid card maybe a little cheap?
It just happens to have a hilariously inappropes name.
Its even sort of costed okay.
Tihs could be in the game.
It just shouldn't be called Kink Banana.
Or have that icon.
I mean with that name you have to give it that icon but yes not in the game.
Not an awful dragon I guess?
I mean ignoring that sheep aren't dragons.
Mini-brawl that comes with a minion unless it kills itself?
We i'd assume you can select the minion that does not take damage.
So you select sen giant.
And boom no damage.
Nah it's op if you get to choose =P.
Yesterday I played Lords of Waterdeep it is a rather good board game.
I also played Spyfall which is a fantastic wee card game and One Night Werewolf which is just shite.
TIl don't be a werewolf.
Still not sold on the new Ecto-1.
MoonWolf can I get a spectate quest done ?
The best candle.
Oh cool they're making that canon.
Him composing the theme was in the pilot.
That was a free card pack thanks xD.
MairBear 2 turns easy win easy life.
I got pretty stupidly lucky.
But hey i'll take it.
!note ChaosSmurf If nothing else you'll enjoy the MTG stuff that inspired it.
GlennCuddlefish i'm watching a stream of the beta of dragons dogma online.
And aside from being f2p and completly in japanese.
Its looking fairly sweet.
Also you can be stupidly fat.
If thats what you enjoy being in videogames.
Streamer is as fat as possible and dressed completly in pink.
The right way of doing it when streaming.
So he is playing my GW2 character?
So he's grown-up Steven Universe?
No more pink less red.
If it ever gets imported I'll either go for full on santaclaus or delicious shortstack again.
More shortstack is always nice.
Also why is life up so bad in vesperia.
I've had it equipped on karol for as long as its been available and he has..6 more HP than yuri at this point.
You can still parkour all over the place and while my japanese is not great it looks like your pawns are still very... pawn.. ish.
If it works anything like DD you have to teach them.
Pawns can be great.
I meant their walking around and combat banter.
So did you know.
I had noticed that.
Something something goblins and fire.
Also you can stil climb on a monster only about half as much taller as you are cling to its head and stab it in the eye.
Now you can reveal enemy secrets and get rid of stealth.
I want that game so bad.
So they'll probably keep it japan only console only.
For no good reason.
Right thats enough of that.
I don't want to listen to more pawn shouting boku wa kochira over and over and over.
I think its his female fighter pawn using some sort of taunt.
I think that's... I'm here?
Parsing through context and which position would make sense.
Darunia is a bit swole rock dude... I think he's Geop.
Wonder if I should try watching a movie tonight.
But cant decide what.
Preferably animation any suggestions?
None at the top of my head sorry.
I ended up playing Dixit with the pensioners.
Then 4 rounds of hacked-together Mysterium.
What was hacked about it?
Secret missions why are you so horrible.
Ones where you have to wait for the NPC's to do something are the worst.
MoonWolf I don't own Mysterium because it hasn't been published in this country yet.
So I made a version out Cluedo and Dixit and my DD4 GM Screen and some chess pieces.
I can be in th emumbles if you wish.
Just going to be playing more FF6.
Haha this hots shoutcasted game on twitch.
Gets to the end of the draft one team hasn't picked a healer for their 5 yet.
They pick Thrall dps for their 5th.
Cue confusion as to whether they mean Rehgar healz.
Since they're both orcs.
No they mean thrall.
Because you can just use a non healer team.
You can that's true but it's hardly the Vaunted Meta.
Fuck the meta we have pocket strats ?
Ok the match has commenced they were indeed srs about thrall.
Not even Garnet's sexiest dance.
Yay I managed to Imp Mog!
Only needed to remove all his equipment to do it.
With Mog as a full health imp.
Probably the most I've embarassed a boss in... anythign.
Who requires an Excalipoor as bait.
This Steven Universe soundtrack includes ringtone-length cuts of Giant Woman.
Good morning if you even slept that is.
Slept sixish hours feeling entirely refreshed.
You should try new PoE its mega-fun D.
> Iwata Disassembling! Wow that really brings back memories. I remember getting my first computer which was a PET and disassembling it to try and analyze it. We didn't have printers at the time so I wrote everything on the screen by hand. I really can't believe I did that. laughs That's how I found out what was going on inside.
> Iwata It just so happens that a computer and the Famicom system had a similar CPU. That's why when I started working with Nintendo I knew about the 6502 better than anybody else in the company.
> Iwata That was fun for me too. At the time when someone came to me and said I'm having trouble because there isn't enough memory I wasâ€”to be honestâ€”really happy. laughs Seeing if you could achieve programming for the same functions with a smaller amount of memory was one way for a programmer to show off.
A true hacker _.
Well thats sucks. I hope miyamoto and/or whoever picks up can stand up against nintendos shareholders as well as iwata.
Or its going to be cellphones and DLC from now on.
Well time to get back to sidequest inferno.
Also I was good at eating again today yesterday.
So I made dinner hamburgers.
I prepare everything come back to my room to enjoy my meal. Think this doesn't taste quite right must be these new buns.
I go to kitchen to clean up and notice I had in fact left out the meat.
Yes it must be the buns.
Thats what I get for cooking at 2am after a day of drinking.
Since you were eating what was likely buns with lettuce maybe some sauce and cheese.
Anathema start PoE try swithcing it to windowed fullscreen 5 error boxes and then a crash.
Also this startup time is not any better.
I always play windowed fullscreen check you're drivers m8.
Glenn meets people.jpg.

Chris Hadfield and Adam Savage dressed up as screen-accurate astronauts from 2001.
Around $20 for it obviously excluding shipping which will probably be another 20 or something p.
*$20 for that and five crew.
FF7 thread discussing female characters in FFs.
Highlights include Beatrix is a better Celes than Celes.
And Relm is the most well-adjusted female character in FF6.
You know out of the 3.5 they have in a cast of 14.
Look at your three most recently played games on your steam profile. They are now blended together with first game as the Genre the second as the Setting and the third as the tone How awesome is this theoretical game? Hmm Arma 3 FONV and Borderlands 2. Aw nuts.
>20 additional rogue exile o_0.
Our police updated their facebooks cover photo.
Don't suppose anyone'd know if Denmark is still on the kroner?
That'll be what dkk is then.
I've wanted to do a narrative Bloodlines LP before I took this over so let's try a narrative chapter. The answer to why? is the same as the answer to why? regarding most decisions made in this mod. Why the fuck not?. v.
No the crazy part was when the door to the meeting room was violently busted open and out stormed Bruno Giovanni in full medieval armor and wielding a battle hammer flanked by knights once again in full armor and wielding swords and maces This goddamn mod.
You know Squeenix should have done their FFVII remake as a Vita exclusive 2d game with really high-res well animated sprites.
Fixes the it will be too expensive to make problem and lets them actually sell some Vitas p.
That would require to people to care about the vita.
Hey its a great system.
How disappointing not a magical hockey mask as a reference to Slasher.
Then again why is that in a crypt?
Oh I know what to make the Giovanni crypt a lot more interesting. Skeletons in armor!
Wtf mod is this ?
The antribu mod for Bloodlines.
Well it starts off promising but then just nosedives because it adds so much combat and buffed up things at random places.
Vita may or may not be great.
I dont know nobody knows since nobody plays on it.
Also that FF VII 2d sprite thing is a bad idea.
Wow been a while since /v/ had music.
Aw yiissss WHTW trailer on friday.
Wow those swipe cuts are so baaaad.
Accidentally bought a german vlu-ray of eva 3.33 hope it has English.
If not you are in for an interesting experience.
An interesting and educational experience even.
Anathema get kicked out of server random queue to rejoin.
Guess i'm done with this game for today.
Nvm queue went away while i complained.
The Age of Sigmar ruleset scraps point values for miniatures leaving players to guess at what a fair fight might look like whuuuut.
People have worked out makeshift systems now based on wounds and such.
But yeah this is pretty much the 40k unbound system taken to its limit.
Hadn't heard that part yet.
Dob I mean its clearly visible on the scrolls they uploaded for free on their website.
What a Long Strange Trip It's Been.
Well y'see I'm still trying to figure out the vaunted lore of end times vs age of sigmar through 1d4chan.
Noelor oh yeah its great.
And you could have a reasonable system without point values.
Getting to reading indepth the 4 page rulebook not so much aside from escapist going lol look at this bollocks.
Say each model is roughly equally valuable when played inside of its intended army.
It does none of those things either.
So you're just sitting there going.
I hope this is fair.
Hadn't they said they're due import 'codices' for existing armies that I would have thought would cover army pts and that?
They'll most likely start release the new army books in a few weeks.
The we're really not thunder warriors honest.
MoonWolf While they've pretty much made all units follow a basic set statline I doubt it will be very much balance because GW doesnt really spend much on in depth playtesting.
They sorta used to but now with their new release every week schedule they only really ensure that stuff is moderatley playable.
And that is dumb.
A recent interview indicates that these rules were intentional as an attempt to make using the older models embarrassing to play in public. hahahahaha.
Each game takes hours to set up and play out.
MoonWolf that's because GW is a model company first and a gaming company second. They are focused on selling their precious jewel like products.
Yes this is pretty much what they have said in the past.
Thats ingoring the bit where a large part of their community organized around competitive play to begin with.
Noelor from what I recall that was during Games Day from some guy so I'd take that statement with a grain of salt.
Amazing a not so terrible picture of Mialee. Shame its not official p.
Look at your three most recently played games on your steam profile... <- Civ BE Pillars of Eternity CiV. I... think I broke the meme sorry.
Noelor too much civ.
Noelor's favourite background track for that is obviously Everbody wants to rule the world P.
Cooked_Auto>> you say that but that track was on a Total War E3 vid.
Also my 3 Goat Sim Hatoful Boyfriend TW Rome 2.
Rayman legends witcher 2 witcher 1.
What was the meme? Because MGR Revengeance Skyrim Heroes of might and magic 6.
Mairnai Look at your three most recently played games on your steam profile. They are now blended together with first game as the Genre the second as the Setting and the third as the tone How awesome is this theoretical game?
Yeah sorry can't work one out for mine.
Pigeon love blooms on a sandbox battlefield.
Hack and slash elder scrolls with a pretentious yet flimsy plot and horrific voicing.
All I got was a witcher platformer.
Mairnai yeah that sounds about right tbh.
I wish strongly that my 3rd was Darkest Dungeon instead of heroes.
In my case I've got a military simulator set in post-apocalyptic united states with overbearingly bad jokes.
And possibly an annoying robot.
Mine is like... historical space-4x-tbs set in a dark fantasy world.
Hey fantasy 4x is a thing if I recall right.
But a fantasy historical space anything.
I guess... some Japanese stuff like that Nobunaga series in which Nobunaga was a mech?
Oh gods don't remind me of that one.
I don't know why I persisted with that to about two thirds through hoping it would get good.
Oh boy time for the part of the game where I am practically forced to keep karol in the party.
You could use Raven!
Or wait is he playing hooky too?
Its right after the floating city.
I can't really remember what order stuff happens in that game.
Just that both of the other healers leave at least once.
Plus because I watched an LP the characters rotated often enough that I can't remember the difference between characters being out of the party and just not in active use.
Best companion? probs.
For like 5 minutes.
She's just jealous I am getting the F D instead of her.
That is the essence of Soda yes.
Partying with each other.
Not partying with sodia.
Something something clever pun on her name and being salty.
My archer just lost his right arm in WHFRP.
Still a 2-handed weapon.
I have 2 pistols already.
Also shouldn't you all be dead and covered in aelfs now?
But I'm not trained in them nor am I left-handed.
I am an aelf.
I was on a boat that got shot with a cannon.
You should be glad to have only lost an arm!
I feel rather irritated it took a UK broadcaster this long to put Agent Carter on.
So yeah about 6 months later can agree it's p good.
Jesus christ this boss is glued to the ground or something.
The secret mission is to knock him down after he does his mystic arte but no matter how I try punching him nothing seems to work.
Fuck it. I give up with this bullshit secret mission.
Just killing the boss this time.
Noelor this DC thing.
MoonWolf yeah I follow the twitter account that posts the magic stuff. It's interesting but still at quite a boring stage.
Some of t hose are pretty funny.
The absurd ones had me alarming the whole house with my sounds.
Just ... ALL minions.
Taunt. Taunt. Taunt. Taunt. Taunt.
Also the tree trap or whataver.
A insight into how fucking awful the British electoral system is.
This morning on the news I got a lift in off my dad the relaxation of the fox-hunting ban is looking to be blocked in the commons.
This is because English voters have been writing to the Scottish MPs urging them to vote against it.
Because they know their own elected MPs won't listen to them.
Yeah its pretty fucked.
Also its a fucking FOX HUNTING THING.
In 2015 is this a serious political issue.
Like the process here is are foxes being an ecological problem due to overpoluation ? no. okay no fox shooting.
The Hunt is to some a storied English tradition.
See you in 5 years in the next review meeting.
Also no trampeling through the countryside on horseback with 10 of your rich friends and their posse of dogs to scare the thing to death.
Go take your horses and dogs to the beach.
Dogs will love it.
Horses probably won't mind either.
And/or let the dogs kill it the way animals tend to kill messily painfully.
I'm not sure horses do great at the beach?
I'm talking the semi wet part near the surf.
Thats fairly dense walking ground.
It sinks pretty easily though.
And horses apply a lot of pressure through their hooves.
Anyway the point wasn't literally go take your animals to the beach. rather than if you want to be out with your friends with too much money and stable animals there are better things to do than murder foxes for no good reason.
I don't know actually put on the costumes and get the horns and just.
Incidentally I can predict the cynical English reaction to this being blocked by the SNP.
Invest a few millions of your too much money int inventing fake animatronix hunting foxes.
MoonWolf they've been doing that for several years now a decade maybe?
Apparently it's just not the same.
Incidentally I can predict the cynical English reaction to this being blocked by the SNP.
Hey they don't get independence you don't get fox hunting.
If you had just let them be independant this wouldn't have happened.
Anathema I hear Nicola Sturgeon is blocking Tory measures in the Commons in the hopes of annoying Cameron into granting independence what a selfish lady.
Although i understand that not letting scotland do what it wants is Also a Proud English Tradition.
MoonWolf yeah that but phrased negatively.
Onyx Path's news feed is so weird.
They seem to post stories and then later someone goes in to tag them after they're published.
Tagging is hard work.
Minister Nicola Sturgeon is boss.
She's in charge of her party.
I like to pretend this is a real headline.
We should have some spreads to share with backers this week exalted progressing at a relative sprint.
Maybe they'll have a good comprehensive index.
Anathema the concept of that being true horrifies me.
13th age has a really nice index.
Minister that horror is why it delights me.
Pugmire meanwhile is getting dark.
Aaah but i wanted to be a lawful neutral dog.
MoonWolf Ex3's index will be replaced by backer names.
A game about being a Good Dog.
The pdf will probably have good bookmarking though based on Mage.
Also the internet/me can fix bad bookmarking.
Anathema post-apocalyptic medieval anthropomorphic dogs.
Helmed by Eddy Webb.
What does it run on ?
Guy behind me to his Muslim colleague I thought Ramadan was 40 days.
I mean I get that not everyone can know everything.
But this guy is mid-late 30s and apparently has never encountered Ramadan before this point?
M8 all I know about Ramadan is that its a Muslim thing that involves fasting.
Would you assume it to be identical to Lent?
M8 all I know about Lent is that it's a Christian thing that involves giving something up.
And it takes place in like March?
But you know it's Christian.
Would you there assume the Muslim Ramadan is identical in length and nature?
Anathema for reference ramadan is a moon cycle thing.
MoonWolf fyi I saw some people saying the Amsterdam PoE server was flakey yesterday.
Also where'd you get to?
Currently doing the new act.
Dominous is still a bullshit fight.
Push over entire act easily oneshot piety.
You're further than I am then.
I just got to the Imperial Gardens.
Lent is also sort of moon cycle based!
In that it always ends on iirc the Friday after a full moon.
Cooked_Auto are these all SDCC cosplay?
The flickr ones are yes.
Not so much SDCC as just something that came up after someone linked.
I feel uncertain about that choice of clothing.
This new thing of making kids watch what their grandparents did.
It annoys me too.
Who actually likes the Clangers?
Very tiny tiny fingers.
World of Darkness.webm.
Is that a werewolf fingering itself in Bloodborne?
My dad adores the Clangers apparently.
Its just its ragdoll spazzing out.
Though he flat-out refused when I offered to get him one of the original series' DVD s.
MoonWolf is it just me or is the more zoomed in camera in Audiosurf 2 kinda annoying?
You can get themes that are the same as default with a zoomed out camera.
And 90% of the skins I seem to find dont bother zooming out.
Anathema finished the final act.
Also I really fucking wish they'd add a marker or something for that you've already played a song in the finder /.
I am honestly suprised that boss made it through that extensive beta in that state.
GGG's thoughts on balance are baffeling to me.
And i used to think the act 3 final boss was bullshit.
I zerged that boss to death with piles of my body.
MoonWolf there have been people saying it is overtuned and IIRC the latest patch lowered the health in normal by some amount.
Anyway after giving it another try i have not revised my opinion of this game.
It has added some intersting ideas with the lootboxes and having general optional areas in a zone with suffixes.
But on the whole still the same drudgy game.
I find it so weird that you don't like PoE but like D3 after how much you played D2.
I just can't even.
The items are uninterstingeven most of the uniques definitly the uniques i found.
All that skills and skill gem stuff sound cool but after a while you realize that after applying all the good upgrades to your skill 90% of them end up being mostly the same only with a different base effect.
Keeping to diablo 2's design on tihs has just led too a game with 50 different skills all designed to be spammed in big aoes.
Or projectiles that all shoot wide cones of stuff that bounce and pierce.
The skilltree looks cool but ends up being just as cookie cutter and restrictive as any talent tree.
The movement model seems to be designed to infuriate me when i try to dodge stuff.
And mana is still a fucking dumb way to manage skills.
Remove mana from the game completly and NOTHING WOULD CHANGE.
Either you leech enough of the stuff you don't care or have 2 slots dedicated to enough mana that you don't care.
Mind Over Matter would break.
A big loss to us all.
You should wait for me and my friend from work to get to Cruel and then play with us it is fun with more people.
4 people would be sweet maybe 5 if I can get oramus in too.
You're welcome to what meager unique items and orbs and such i found.
I won't need them.
What uniques? did you get a Facebreaker by any chance? D.
Let me go open the game a sec.
2 The Deep Ones Hide.
Kaltenhalt Crown of Thorns Ondars Clasp Fencoil and a Bloodplay.
Play a dual weilding duelist.
3 of my uniques are shields.
Only 1 is even a duelist weapon.
Maybe they should just make a D3 ish league where you can't trade but they make the loot system not hate your guts.
I found a.
How is that worthless it lets you take a major passive without even needing to go near it.
'cause that is only time you'd use it.
And if you're going Blood Magic you're usually around that end of the tree anyway for the delicious life nodes.
I wonder if I can somehow find a site to watch Steven Universe on my phone.
On the way to games.
Download the episodes to your phone/get a tablet?
Minister i could endeavor to find one.
Oh that was suprisingly easy.
Not sure it works on your phone.
For the next decade.
The best image.
Scottie Young does some amazing stuff.
MoonWolf tyvm let's see if it works.
Wait...Tarantula wasps get drunk?
<- pluto looks suprisingly boring.
Now I just need a bus to complete the equation...
These lyrics are way to introspective and well spoken to be amethyst.
Yeah it's a little ooc.
Premium Pearl right there.
She makes me feel well-adjusted.
Look at all these issues and neurosis you don't have!
Minister that ending just does not care for any walls.
Uncle Grandpa caed more even.
MoonWolf I think singing makes everyone in cartoons more articulate though.
You know when amethyst started singing i thought it was going to be not about pearl.
We're still on pearl and her ever increasing list of issues.
Pearl is this season's big bad.
Foreshadowed in the... 3rd-ish episode when she almost killed Steven through exposure to the cold void of space.
Also I thought it was about Garnet.
Pearl kills everone because of her hangups over rose.
And her status as best space lesbian mom.
The song that is.
Why won't you let me destroy the planet for you Rose?!
Waiting for the flashback where we find out she tried to murder greg in his sleep.
Only slightly less creepy than the part in Lion 2 when she was just watching Rose - that is to say Steven - sleep.
Which while not uncreepy at the time has grown steadily creepier with an increase in context.
....I knew something was up with my connection today but this is ridiculous.
That download has gone from 69 to 68%.
Back in season 1 i used to think pearl as the sensible one who kept everthing together.
Sort your shit mega.
But the more we find out about pearl.
Oh god konami took kojima's name off of the metal gear V box art.
MoonWolf yeah she was just the least human of the three not... issues McGee.
Taylor Swift into 00s punkpop into k-pop into What Is Love.
This noodle joint is so good.
That is a very particular playlist.
Strong greek goddess who needs no man.
Strong Clean greek godess.
You'd think a godess of the hunt would have some dirt on her or maybe some twigs or something.
TIL that bestiality is legal in finland.
Googly eyes makes everything better.
Cooked_Auto Syv just recruited and sent a stone golem to the copper coronet.
Just stomping off to go stand in a corner.
Nobody cares this is FR weirder things happened 20 minutes ago.
Well this series is escalating quickly. After 2 episodes this guy is living with 3 monster girls.
Yeah thats going to happen for a while.
GlennCuddlefish have they had sex yet.
Whats even the point.
If it was up to the monster girls they would have.
Unfortunately the law is in the way.
But the law says no afaik.
Lol suprise sarevok rematch.
!e 20 15 10 5.
See if i care.
Googly eyes makes everything better <- They really do.
MairBear you must now make this your army theme.
The saga of being followed and unfollowed by the PCG editor continues.
Nono we're back on following.
For I think the 4th time?
First since I stopped working and turning my twitter feed into a hell pit though.
So my dad has started a business with some former colleagues for something to do and maybe aid income in his retirement.
It involves telling people specifically government people how to make more money.
And I swear every time he tries to talk about it it just sounds like a scam.
Like I'm sure it isn't because my dad's a decent guy but.
He keeps wondering why nobody's taking any notice of their offers and I'm just like.
They think this sounds like a scam.
Well that and everybody and their grandma run a consulting firm these days.
Specificaly just the grandmas though.
Because it's all people who have retired from salary work.
But have quarter-half their lives left.
Granted some do it as their salary work as well.
I met Uematsu for a meet and greet after a Distant Worlds concert and said Shake my hand if Squall dies in Disc 1 of FFVIII and the rest of the game is a dream and after looking confused for a moment he smiled and shook my hand so I can confirm that it's canon.
I'm doing that for all things.
Its at times like this I question my life choices.
So there I was browsing the internet. on 4chan. And I am bored out of my skull so I decide to follow that link. I mean what could go wrong.
I ended up watching a cam show with a mostly naked ronald mcdonald sitting on harley quinn while reading nutritional facts.
I think thats enough internet for tonight.
Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.
Next project is basically just smut and is called Gay Buttlers with two T’s. It will put the BUTT back in Buttler classy art from Britain.
The moral of today's SU is that space lesbians are adorable.
...or uh be honest in relationships or something.
Keystone is a state!
It's the Keystone State!
Pizza is square there.
In more serious topics.
Garnet doesn't have any fire/ice powers.
Does that mean a ruby/lapis fusion would have steam powers ?
I'm fairly sure there is never going to be a non garnet ruby or saphire fusion.
But it would be rad.
Steven with one of them to save the other?
Possibly the only exception.
If Steven can even fuse with pure gems.
You said you weren't.
I know right you gotta be real careful about what kind of car you put those on.
I don't actually mind.
And/or I also had Garnet spoiled and that means I get to spread the lack of mystery.
Android why do you autocorrect that to Garnett that isn't a word.
It's in the default dictionary.
I still blame ChaosSmurf.
Also if I type and it suggests androgynous before android.
Your library is a reflection of yourself.
Yeah I get androids.
But still amuses me.
Cooked_Auto ofcourse YOU do.
Well what do YOU get then? >|.
Don't have a a predictive andriod device handy.
Cool that's still tonight's date.
Well the odds are certainly not in my favor today.
I think I've won about 10% of these 30-50 50% rolls.
Love the fact that you still have to pay for shipping.
So you know how people say why don't they just make a film length warcraft cinematic.
Well based on that SDCC footage that's what they've done.
Because it looked like well over 95% CG.
Well the movement and faces I assume aren't.
Have t his gif of a fox.
SunTiger tavern brawl is ambiguous this week huh?
MairBear its completly random decks.
I'm not a fan.
I'll beat you up once though.
Grmbl unless I can get this fixed before the game this might be a problem.
I think I fixed it.
Have to run to the store.
And then have to run back and then prepare stuff. and with luck I will have pizza by the time of the game.
Going to go ahead and disbelieve GlennCuttlefish running.
Yes I have a hard time believing that as well.
SunTiger when's this Hearthstone thing.
ChaosSmurf someone telling a Riot employee that they are less efficient and ship fewer projects than *Valve* though.
Like Dota 2 reborn actually came out and isn't just rotting in beta.
Like anything ending in 3 exists.
SunTiger what time's Wednesday games again?
You know the yuuush.
How about you two go fuck yourselves with your functioning legs |.
Cooked_Auto I have 4 games a week now all at different times.
SunTiger MairBear I don't know what this week's tavern brawl even is but I won 2 games with Paladin very easily.
ChaosSmurf your deck is completly randomized.
Like if you clicked finish my deck on an empty deck.
Seems to have a fairly high bias for legendaries though.
'm not a fan.
Its okay against friends.
But not exactly great against random people.
SunTiger two of my opponents had malygos v.
It never gives you cheap spells with malygos.
I have the 1/2 mech guy.
It'd be interesting if you could get cards outside your class.
Or if it was randomised archetypes.
Still got 80 gold and a pack out of 2 matches so w/e.
Missed loads of dailies the past 2 weeks.
Too busy playing way to much magic.
SunTiger>> what are you doing watching himegoto?
<- glenn meets employed friends. also is a loli for some reason.
Note the IRON STAR on the gun arm.
Actual footage of actual exalted 3 pages.
Is it really 600 pages ong.
Holy piss I'm mad about this SC2 stuff.
You have to pre-purchase to get the prologue stuff.
But they haven't put the physical CE up yet.
So I'm probably just gonna be buying it twice.
And I know it's going to be like an hour of entertainment less than 6 months early and I'm going to do it anyway.
Well off to prepare the second part of pizza. Will try to be on time for the game.
I thought the prologue campaign was gonna be open-access?
I have several questions.
There may or may not be several answers.
They are mostly just varied iterations of WTF.
Like it sort of makes sense that most of these could be states.
But then we get to libido.
Also why is a door vulnerable to shocking.
And why isn't it immune to most of these.
He's a terrible door.
That's why he got put in prison.
Now i just have MORE QUESTIONS.
Gonna be a bit late. Dough is proving..Troublesome.
Hopefully done in 10 minutes.
Still working on this anyway.
Rolling below AC.webm.
Why do i have these MairBear.
Sonic is not amused.

One of the few things I can read in this set of Exalted previews is a sidebar title Storyteller Advice Skip It.
Also Ahlat looks dumb.
Meanwhile this asshole wolf.
Noelor.
GlennCuttlefish looks like Yuri's more about the wolf asshole in that pic.
Urgh those page numbers are really bad.
The e3 layout preview images.
Hasn't it been through layouting for a while now? v.
Yeah but there is previews now.
So another four months of layouting then from the feedback.
I can't even... wait.
Is that what those black boxes are?
Because if so yeah that's p garb.
Yes i think so.
Oh yeah ok I can see numbers in them on the Ahlat page.
Noelor>> yeh smethin like that.
Time/place/formality for tomorrow evening?
Erm / Loch Fyne / smart.
7-something maybe can get you a definite tomorrow.
Also can't fully quantify smart like tomorrow main event is smart-smart.
I expected mum to have heard from Babs but apparently not.
Like you'll not have changed since the ceremony smart or nice meal smart?
I'm part envisioning the evening as dress-down yet still smart non-aligned trouser + jacket as that's how we set up last yr's one for sis.
But I don't wanna get too shown up by what the uncle's wearing yknow.
Well in any case I'll not paint my nails then =P.
I actually can't because one of my fingers has exposed nailbed atm.
Bear the pain be fabulous.
Yeah you've probably not met my uncle.
Is this maternal uncle?
Nah the other one.
I think I at least met both of them last year but didn't interact much.
I meant that glenn hadn't.
Well ok that side of your family are varyingly devout catholics from western scotland.
So even though I was sarcastic about the nails.
No I would not wear makeup when meeting them in context of being your friend.
So is your uncle fabulous as well?
Maybe some foundation for my eyebags.
Will he demand a fabulous show off?
Will his stand be unleashed?
Ashe is a pretty good character but her outfit has absolutely nothing to do with that at best and makes her look like a hooker at worst.
Word is this is what most Final Fantasy VII fans are looking forward to in the remake.
If they add anything to the remake they better let us use those outfits in battle. battle dresssss.
Suddenly bollywood music videos.
Not too keen on it because the developer seems a bit so and so.
I just want to purging action.
Hope for DoW3 maybe?
Not my type of games.
That... is the edgiest inquisitor.
No that's the other game.
There is in fact a Eisenhorn game developed by some other third-rate studio that you've never heard about.
People annoyed at traffic?
Oh jeez gw why u do dis.
Because they're cheap pretty much vOv.
And they're really stingy about IP control as well since they get a chance to control a lot more with smaller developers than major ones.
People annoyed at traffic?
Episode 65 - Onion Friend oh boy.
Om my god its ADORABLE.
Slay 6*10E9 demons | Shit! Tactical girliness! | Bearer seek seek lest. | TGAO - 22nd Surrounded By Armies | OTS - 28th.
...so bad at this phone.
Why is OTS in a mario level?
He made it up.
Dry Dry Desert is a mario kart course iirc.
They were doing worldbuilding and mairbear added a desert.
Anathema Mair put us in a desert.
And I was the one who changed the topic.
So yes it's now a Mario stage.
I think it's ch2 in Paper Mario as well as a track in Kart.
Onion has a mom also she talks.
SunTiger also understands him.
Things I did not expect to do today Look for an empty CD or DVD.
People still have those ?
Thats what I thought.
Looks like I certainly dont.
But I did find a testament to my shitty music taste of past years.
I wished I had DVD driver because I found a bunch of old burned music cds I had made ages ago and was curious what is on them.
I just use my PS3 to browse these.
I think I had some spare blank CDs somewhere last time I tidied my room.
CBA to actually install my DVD drive atm.
The one I had in my old one used IDE cables v.
Oh yeah not sure my computer has those now.
In my younger years I have listened to bad metal and for some reason warcraft music it seems.
And final fantasy music.
I still do. Zero fucks given.
*grumble* Still no Heavensward soundtrack and the Satellite Reign and Kong soundtracks are far from release >_>.
Oh boy another CD marked just audio.
I wonder if I can borrow a laptop that has a CD drive and just load stuff over to my small external.
Track 1 Disturbed I think? Track 2 CID music.
Shitty electronic goth music. guess I still like this track I just wish the bad bass samples weren't so pronounced.
Trigun OP. this CD just got more awesome.
Followed by cowboy bebop op and...Azumanga music? Great. now I will have this track in my head all day.
Eh I'll admit naruto had a pretty good OST. one of the good things about it.
Goodie find a laptop in the house with a dvd drive.
But I'll start looking through the cds after Ive been out for a walk I think.
GlennCuttlefish it did some really inresting things with its music.
When it wasn't being generic.
Cool GoG has added Chaos Gate and Final Liberation to its library as well as Shadow of the Horned Rat.
Let's see what embarassing drek is on this CD labeled *my name* MP3.
Nothing I already still dont have on my playlist. With some exceptions.
Going through a DVD named Game music 2 reminds me that my collection is pretty goddamn old and has barely changed because all the stuff in this one is from 2004 and I still have most of it left.
And all I can envision is some parody of the goblins parody with someone going I'm saaaaaaad _.
Pealr being sad involves less crying and more active self destructive behaviour.
Pearl being sad ends well for nobody it's true.
Pearl gets to sad and suddenly your best friend is a loyal to the point of suicide fencer.
Its just not a good time for anyone.
The gayest space rocks.
W10 is still in beta right?
I've not invented that?
My dad was asking about installing it.
Sorry that last thing was re the SU tumblr post.
I failed at ctrl+v.
I realized as such.
Noelor its getting pretty gay.
I guess its not 24/7 makeout fest yet.
It oculd be gayer.
Good evening Dob MEng.
It's 1751 UTC+1 and the sun's still up at 55 deg N I still call that afternoon.
So I call it evening.
But I see your point.
I think Noelor is onto something here.
I see yours.
...ok you made it weird.
Dob what trousers should I wear~.
I'd earmarked chinos for myself.
Enjoy this adorable reaction as a distraction from your current argument.
To both of those things.
Given the speed that this LP is moving at I wonder if it'll finish before the 4-year-old FF7 LP A comment in the FF IX lp.
I didn't know they were brothers.
But as soon as I found out.
You are better at noticing than i am.
That won't be a flavour of anything for you.
It'll be I dunno zur krijm onjijn.
Whereas here that is the only correct flavour of eg Pringles.
Ui and zuure room.
Don't you ellipsis at me mairbear.
It was aimed at Noelor but is tat actually how to dutch?
Yes over here you could get some Ui en zure room chips.
The vanilla chips variety is Paprika though.
But krijm onjijn is not real please tell me its not.
Thats not a real anything.
That last one is CLOSE to our word for bunny though.
Okay good my ellipses were justified then.
GODDAMNIT JUST DO YOUR FUCKING MYSTIC ARTE.
MY FACE IS RIGHT HERE PUNCH IT WITH EVERYTHING YOU GOT GODDAMNIT.
Face face in the face.
Bullets in my face.
SunTiger Whoa... Frodan's hair.
Where yare you seeing frodan right now ?
He's had it dyed ginger....
Why did you do it frodan.
Well the boss did the arte just didnt trigger the hit effect.
At least this boss can heal itself.
Why do you need it to do the mystic art and also hit with it ?
I dont have to do the mystic arte.
And because it occasionally triggers this kind of stagger animation.
During which I have to knock the boss down.
Because SECRET MISSIONS ARE FUN.
Good job alexei. I am sure that was for the best.
Thanks sodia. Instead of just chilling you have to be all dere again.
Also all of this could have been avoided if this douchebag had just actually told anyone about things.
Instead of smouldering with generic rage.
But if good communication skills were a thing in jrpgs the plot would be over in 2 hours.
So I just got a tutorial about resting.
I am in third act.
I think its the first time I rested in the bed near the starting point of the game.
There's Skywhales in the Black Company world and they shit out flying stingrays that impale people.
Hulk La Hulk.
All the things were cancelled tonight c.
Fear not I can entertain you by complaining about secret missions loudly.
That would in fact be more entertaining than my first contingency plan.
Dare I even ask.
It's not that fascinating just I meet up with people at a pub and we study japanese while the class isn't on.
Well that doesn't sound too bad in all honesty.
Unless you hate these people.
It's not bad at all.
I never really figured out the secret missions. But I was gonna do that if I started any NG+.
Which is why I use a guide.
And then I found a baby.
Just a random baby.
SunTiger played sense demons on tavern brawl drew the two nothing else on offer demons v.
Turn 1 coin pint-sized summoner Opponent uses silence.
Later on same opponent loses because I have a 6 attack mistress of pain from 3 buffs.
Man wonder if I should finally seriously consider getting that tattoo.
Ugh just spent an evening getting drunk while in full-on dude mode and it was surprisingly exhausting toward the end.
Noelor that's why you never go full dude-mode.
Obesity 'Slim chance' of return to normal weight REALLY bbc news? A fat pun?
SunTiger enemy played nat pagle and gave it stealth from master of disguise. It drew a card EVERY TURN for 8 turns.
MairBear mis-use of normal aside.
I don't think I as a journalist for any organisation could have resisted that pun.
You do realise you're a villain right?
SunTiger one more to the pile of fuck the 4th wall endings.
It was a very ... play-ish play.
Noelor that poor fourth wall.
Might have to check that game out.
Finally its really accurate.
Can still move his head. Needs more work.
It's okay Warmachine has you covered.
Looks like he hid the instruction manual for his sword in the pauldrons.
Wait was it chant and then 3 turns clockwise or counter clockwise?
Well after thinking of it I think I might be able to do ps3 headphone surround like this get me a RCA -> 3.5mm jack adapter plug that into my microphone in slot enable audio play through that mic enable dolby headphone surround and run that through the amp.
Well technically that last part is not required but.
Except..I am not sure that actually translates either. hm. I suspect it loses the signal on the first part since the cable will still only transfer stereo sound.
Wonder how that translates. I think I had one of those adapters...somewhere.
So i'm playing resident evil 6 for some reason.
In this mission it has been established that alarms summon zombies.
So I enter a room and there is some kind of contraption in front of me a chest high box on the left side and a metal detector on the right side.
Leon refuses to jump over the box.
WHAT A SURPRISE ZOMBIES.
In Resident Evil even!
I love the fact that the Changeling campaign the others in my skype group has played 3 or 4 sessions and has already devolved into PvP.
And thats just from people playing their characters and nothing else.
I can't remember if I mentioned this last week but our dept at work has a quote of the day board.
What I did mention last week is that as of last week every Friday is casual Friday but shorts are banned.
Well that last thing.
So today's quote is I like shorts! They're comfy and easy to wear!
Not the first thing i think.
Minister I take it this was your idea? P.
Or doing I should say.
Thats not a very noelor thing to do.
But its also a pkoemon reference.
Cooked_Auto wins the points.
I don't pokemon enough.
Last pokemon I played was Silver I think.
And that was way before that reference happened.
So guess the companys name that was responsible for these zombies?
Problem with following gunnerkrigg court in the fashion that I do is that there are parts missing and I am too lazy to check the actual site.
So from my perspective annie is just randomly having a mental breakdown now.
I was upset until I saw this.
So from my perspective annie is just randomly having a mental breakdown now <- yeah thats basically whats going on.
Â£94 to get my suit jackets taken in.
MoonWolf For some reason Audiosurf 2 becomes less fun when you realize that the music algorithm is 90% of the time just based on the drums.
<- i love tihs guy.
Looks like some random tough bloke in a bar.
Welcome to the most adorable gif you'll click today.
Fuck the NGE 3.33 I bought doesn't have english audio.
Amazon have no region 2 english vlu-rays for it at all oh well.
Jesus christ I hope this installer is not a portent of things to come. I left it to install about a hour ago.
GlennCuttlefish what are you installing ?
My mouse cursor is invisible on Windows 8.
Try plugging a mouse in on the remote computer.
I have one mouse.
Replug it to another usb port.
Force windows to re-configure the mouse.
I am trying to stream PoE to my mac.
Since devices are technically different devices on different ports.
Only when manufactorers suck and don't put a serial number on them.
In my experience this is the vast majority of the time.
Especially on simple things like keyboards and mice.
The problem is I need the mouse for my mac btu windows wont show the cursor without it plugged in.
Why do you need it to show a cursor withouta mouse plugged in ?
So I can play PoE.
Try the other PoE.
See if that helps.
Its a windows problem.
I am sure picking the hardest difficulty on character I dont know was the best idea.
I beat this boss using the age old wisdom If nothing else works lame it out.
Sadly that dropped my stylish rank to D.
Actually technically not the hardest.
Seems its equal to normal hard mode in enemy health just spawns a whole lot more enemies.
TIL this is a thing.
I dont think that challenged me enough. And /v/ is doing it again so here I go.
No don't do it!
You've so much to live for!
Cooked_Auto did you uh.
Did you link yesterday's Qwertee to me and I missed it?
No yesterday Qwertee were Alien shirts and that didnt seem up your alley.
Sorry Wednesday I guess.
Like it's so much cooler than their usual level of Pop Culture thing 1 + Pop Culture thing 2.
Those are the shirts I tend to prefer as well.
Not that I don't get the occassional mashup.
I thinka decent portion of my t-shirts are just pokémon *puns* though?
That wouldnt surprise me the slightest.
Like y'know the ones with a picture of a pocket monster in a fake pocket.
Fuck you kanga roo and your bullshit.
Obey the laws of physics for fucks sake.
Those two fell beneath my bat.
But now I am against the dark lord of the skies Owl.
But then owl in his wisdom reminded me that I am a mere mortal after all and would stand no chance against the dark lord Robin.
.. o_o What kind of fucked up Poohgame are you playing Glenny?
Or are you just very high?
Of all the responses I expected a weird Asian Poohbaseball flash game was not one of them.
The heffalump is a cheating bag of poop.
The asshole of the internet agrees that is the second most difficult flash game.
Right after spongebob boatocross.
Is there an end to this?
Is is rumoured that christopher robin is the final boss.
The real reason I came here was to ask for an idea of what to draw.
Piglet is sly bastard.
Since this is occupying my time more OC of it.
I lost and I don't know why or how.
OC of.. baseball Pooh.
OWL YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
Owl was always the most frustrating normal opponent in this game.
At least tiggers bullshit you can predict.
But its impossible to humanly calculate owls throws.
Noelor Okee! After Pooh 3.
This is a really good book.
You're a good book.
Still no full season torrent of steven universe.
So I'm just gonna assume the show sucks.
Just fuckin' stream it.
>not watching cartoons on my telly.
Do you just like.
Not look veyr hard ?
I checked the pirate bay.
Pirate bay is dying.
Kickass torrents is basically the new piratebay.
Inb4 banned by VM.
I can get you a magnet.
Will check it out this weekend.
There is no collection beyond this.
So your down to single downloads or streaming.
17 episodes in s2 so far.
One its a video of a cockatoo yelling into a tiny cup.
Two they have to realize what they did with that account name.
I have no idea how ironically anyone from Essex/Sussex/Middlesex uses their region any more.
Own done. On to the guardian jester who bends time and space.
I think it's Tigger.
Sweet jesus someone won in that thread.
I...I cant see it anymore.
Goddamnit I cant see tigers throws anymore.
Getting too old for this m.
We believe in you!
Oh Gate ep3 is out.
If all else fails just link us the screenshot from the thread and bathe in our praises.
Family annoyed at me for taking too long to play a turn of scrabble not my fault my hand was full of consonants.
Use a Welsh dictionary next time problem solved.
Iunno don't think it was a hand with G L W D Y N ish.
This video sums about my feelings.
My face while playing this now.
Maybe I'll take a break. check if those games I moved to PS3 actually work.
Attempt drawing kittens then get depressed because I cant yet.
Climb mount everest since that is the easier option here.
Seems the samurai warriors 4 I got was a PSN version.
Which means I would have to 1 install new CFW that actually supports PSN games 2 install a bigger hard drive.
At least virtua fighter 5 seems to work.
Thats pretty spot on.
I'm a bit out of touch with AT doesn't she have short hair now or something?
Anyway only quick because it's sleeeptime <3.
She might I'm pretty behind as well.
Man GATE is turning out to be really disappointing for such a neat concept.
I saw its 1st. I did not warm to its protag.
Not ruled out looking further but am just terribly behind w/ this season already.
I'm only really watching My Monster Secret/Actually I am Jitsu Wa GATE and Monster Musume.
This list does not include dbz super.
Because the only Dragonball I will ever watch is the abridged series.
*shrug* some of us never watched it when it was relevant.
Spider hero! No Hyphen.
Fucking peridot why do you have detachable legs.
Mairnai i have news.
News about an important xcom/long war mod.
BIG HEAD MODE.
Goddamn it Sassy Imp.
It teleported me 300 ft in the air above the heart of hellscreams camp in nagrand v.
<= great Path of Exile item 29% more damage WHILE DEAD.
NSFW I guess?
Moreso than most nsfw things.
I mean I guess there are technically tits in there but.
I'm sorry the what now?
I knows the hacker.
MoonWolf only died twice on Malachai.
Ballache of a fight though anyone who gets through that on hardcore deserves a fuckin' medal.
Noelor thats pretty amazing.
Noelor i think we can make ihs happen in roll20.
Sweet just won two auctions for the old Witch Hunters and Armageddon codexi.
Spyfall is p great.
Thanks for clearing that up.
You can tell it's cute because it's wearing a bow.
Steven Universe seems pretty good.
This is a correct opinion.
Your opinion has been aproved by the collective.
The girl in the donut shop is voiced by the lady who does Bee from Bee Puppycat.
Yeah I can believe that.
Then again I have been playing fightan with a friend most of today so no regrets.
Could have been playing fightan AND watching fightan.
Currently watching someone in actual chainmail speedrun d2.
Yeah I am not going to half ass fightan.
Win ratio 69% so I guess I could have afforded to but.
I am torn between smash and GG XRD atm.
Wait I have 2 screens time to close down PS3.
Did you fix the leading comma? or is it only 2+ names that breaks it?
I didn't touch it.
Garnet has sung the longest song in the series.
Well semi farschnickled hopping on mumble.
Anathema mirrored items ?
MoonWolf the icon is mirrored.
A mirrored item is always a copy of its regular counterpart and is identical except for the 2D art which is reversed. yup.
Noelor that was some intense solitaire.
'night damn these US timezoned games.
Anathema Rebecca Sugar wrote the Simon Marcy episodes of Adventure Time among others.
ChaosSmurf can't you get an email address from virgin media?
Of course we do EarthBound.
Why does it have a cohort ?
Why doesn't susan have any PP.
Susan never has PP.
He's the one non-psychic.
In return he's some sort of savant with gadgets and explosives.
ChaosSmurf I don't understand 76's Ult either.
MoonWolf confirmed for copying EarthBound.
So in todays 13th age we advanced about 50meters in game.
And then one of the players passed out due to alcohol/lack of sleep.
So we spent the day playing monty python fluxx and Lords of waterdeep instead.
Lords of Waterdeep is p good played it last week.
GlennCuttlefish what are you playing 13th age trench war ?
MoonWolf the fact that one player fell asleep affected it more than the actual plot.
We just entered an undead village.
All cows no matter what they're thinking go Moo. It'd be handy to remember that. Mother 3 off to a Mothery start.
That is a fucking lie.
Source me someone who has been around fucking cows in his life.
Getting a bit meta there Alec.
Also are those dinosaurs ?
They like it when people ram into them.
The one big difference in this game is that by timing A Button presses to the beat of the music you can do extra damage to enemies. Mother!
Its like games made by the yoko taro of nonsequtor instead of the normal old boring yoko taro of depression and futility.
Alec doesn't believe in the fourth wall at all.
Fourth curtain maybe.
Aaaaah I tried tuning my guitar and now one string sounds off but my ears aren't good enough to tell when it is right and now every chord I play sounds bad oh my god.
Oh gods traveling hangover again.
Exalted forum users are some kind of special.
I could pirate this entire book but instead I'm going to break my eyes transcribing the tiny text of 10 randomly-chosen pages.
Exalted forum people are basically just living pretending the leak DOES NOT EXIST.
There's always time for that Mother 3.
Actually i was thinking i could some cheese got any cheese ?
Looking at you Necromancer Joe.
Get yourself some PP.
The game's only just starting cut him some slack.
We made crimi illegal.
So there isn't any.
Whoopsie.
Should i look at my twitter for the last 8 hours.
Nope just ChaosSmurf talking welll yelling incohrently at evo.
I wish there was a quick way to order my NPC's not to use skills that knock down enemies in this.
Mairnai someone made a bug report. about fatigue rogue... existing.
Holy shit its the gayest thing i'll see all day.
In case anyone here somehow didn't already get it.
Oh yeah the Vanillaware/Atlus project is getting revealed today. Neat.
Mesdames looks to me like it should have an accent.
But autocorrect disagrees so w/e.
All hail mighty autocorrect.
Finally got some proper attachable sunglasses.
Instead of those dumb ones that are glasses you just put infront of yours lik 3D glasses.
MoonWolf dyk when the next book in the Shadow Campaign/Thrones/whatever series is out?
I feel like it was soon last time I was on Amazon.
It is in fact... out.
Kindle app is a bit of an arse to use.
I should dig my actual kindle out then.
Also a food classic.
Fuck now Im reminded its been ages since I had homeade pierogi's.
<- thats actually really good.
Also I am sure I pointed that out when I got my passport.
Man I'm hungry now.
Guess I will have to raid the kitchen.
Yeah I started read the source thread after being hungry from my walk which was a bad idea.
I'd totally play a Superior Foes of Batman campaign.
Worlds most competent farmer.
That looks like like the herobb manga.
Sadly Ive forgotten the source for it cant remember if Ive seen it linked other than on /tg/.
All of the prime elements.
Best thing about DAI was disgusted noise Cassandra made whenever Varric spoke.
I just assume its a sci-fi/cyberpunk food porn adventure.
Well points to Warmachine for originality.
Or maybe even a mech foodporn adventure. I mean its Vanillaware after all.
Oh boy oh boy time for nam cobanda.
Nam cobanda is the island with all sorts of side attractions. Including my favorite poker.
!note MairBear Leaks probably questionable.
!note ChaosSmurf Leaks probably questionable.
Well thats the first 1.25 million chips collected.
How many do you need again ?
Depends on what I am going to buy.
If I am doing the gald farm trick A lot.
Well it's just my non-prescription shades so.
Not the end of the world.
Meanwhile upon emptying my pockets.
I seem to have accidentally brought home a stack of post-its.
Its you you are the person responsible for the office supply shrinkage problem.
1021 <- if only Pearl were that competent.
Pearl is perfectly Competent.
At things she's you know.
Just not at some things.
Like Life Choices or Emotions.
1156 Solar <- I sincerely want to know what anime this is.
If it didn't have the long hair and the gold tatoos.
It could almost be Gilgamesh the Magical Boy.
Kamigami no Asobi apparently.
The heroine Yui Kusanagi is the daughter of a Shinto shrine. She discovers a mysterious sword which transports her to a different world where she meets the Greek god Zeus great.
I've read enough Zeus to know where this is going.
Not what i imagined zeus to be like.
He invites her to attend a school in a separate world that he created. Zeus intends to teach the meaning of love to the various young divine beings who also attend the school this is an otome VN btw.
If he thinkgs girls are into magical boys by olympus he's going to be a magical boy.
That got adapted into an anime last year.
By the same studio that made Durarara!
Which is still on my list.
Duran Duran I barely made headway with before moving on.
It was one animesoc went with last winter so I generally didn't go along those meets.
Huh 75% of DoW 1 and 2 coupons. Yay I guess.
Stuff relating to dow1/2 sales gets me strangely upset in a aww but I have all of the games and all of the retribution dlc already.
Buy it... for a friend ?
Like if you really want too.
You can do that.
They probably also already own it.
If you want to just keep throwing money at THQ.
I probably don't have them *on Steam*.
Its been dead for 3 years now.
Its properties devoured by other studios.
I didn't want to say Games Workshop.
Because I know that's also inaccurate.
I don't even know who is making money off of DoW sales.
How the dicks do I own Ultra Street Fighter IV.
ChaosSmurf is it your fault?
Could also be it.
Why am i not allowed to play MTG free to play yet.
What is this bullshit.
Pretty sure you can look over your transaction history to find out.
Because the game is supposed to be out on steam.
I was referring Noelor and USF4.
I have no idea how to find that.
Account details - store transactions.
Or licenses + subscriptions.
Nope can't find either of those.
Also don't honestly care enough.
ChaosSmurf will continue to be blames.
Oh I get it. It's free because of EVO or something.
Because I have it as well.
I think CS is probably in an EVO induced fatigue coma.
So I guess it'll be removed soon.
MoonWolf there's another novella.
Probs between the books like the last one.
Makes sense t y.
A lot of my steam how the dicks do I own...? q's are often answered by Potato Sack.
MoonWolf dyk this series exists.
But now i do!
Man the sty le has changed SO MUCH.
I'll watch this later.
I await your explenation at the edge of my seat here.
Don't leave a man hanging.
It was an indie games bundle sold in the lead-up to Portal 2's release with various tie-in content.
The more they sold potato sacks and ppl played them the sooner portal 2 got released.
Now that the board/card games industry is 90% Kickstarter and 10% water seems accurate.
The boardgame industry needs to start hydrating.
That is very bad for boards and cards.
... going to stick with laminate.
Moreso than the orignal which was terrible but fit its timeframe in a cheesy way.
Well it wont have Lucy Lawless for once and probably no lesbians.
Hey there was no lesbians.
Much like nanoha and fate are just friends.
Who adopt a daughter together.
And sleep in the same bed.
Thats a thing friends DO.
And Sailors Uranus and Neptune are cousins!
In their one bedroom apartment thing.
I think the marketting speak is Studio apartment.
If it's all one space.
How many drugs did you take this time sad cat.
Yikes facebook image urls.
That image and that url have a lot in common.
They are both terrible.
'It'll be fiiine!' and that's why I'm chanelling Valour we're so good at Exalted.
Thats not how you valour.
I'm pretty sure that's exactly how you valour.
Its Exalted who cares.
Gears of SF rolls 35 dice to Atk the fair folk 12 successes ughhh.
...and then the Orichalcum aspect dealth 19 damage with a single stab.
They are better than eveyrone else.
You can tell because they are golden.
<- A devious plan.
With my poker profits I have put into motion my masterplan of smuggling weapons into the hot springs.
GlennCuttlefish you may secretly be the badguy.
Wait where did I get that much money.
I should be sub million at this point but I have 1.2 million now.
Laundering your illigitimate poker winnings through weapons trade.
Nothing illegimate about them.
Its just a matter of optimizing my doubling in this.
Its not real money its casino money made up by weirdo's on an island.
You have to buy the chips with gald anyway.
Well you could use grade but who does that =.
Why would you EVER do that.
I have never understood grade in Taleseses.
That reminds me I think I now have everything required for the final part of my plan Automated grade farm.
Don't really care enough.
I never did finish the future arc of ToGfff.
In short its currency for your new game + bonuses.
You use it to buy newgame plus options.
This is probably why I never cared.
My alchemical had a performance specialty in tribal dance.
I can barely remember when it appeared and she's used it maybe twice and I really had to force it.
So I downloaded a new specialty into that memory address!
And now she's an expert evangiliser instead.
Also I rolled to sleep perchance to dream tonight and nobody noticed =<.
Oh come on they changed how this works in the PS3 version.
Cant auto grade farm now.
Dan Shive sure draws comics.
You know when the mood strikes.
Meanwhile Rich is predicting Ex3 to be ready during GenCon just so that his being at GenCon can provide that last bit of delays.
I'll believe it when i'm reading it.
Cooked_Auto so TDI got filled full of glass.
GlennCuttlefish Poppy is up to some shounen anime level combat shenanigans.
That ding noise is perfect.
And then I got this costume.
Welp karol i stuck as that thing now.
Rita's theories are more profound than the legs of an octopus.
Many things are though.
Except patty patty isn't profound at all.
That was pretty profound imo.
Welp brawl night tonight!
Don't get to attached to that either.
I might be visiting relatives part of that week.
Will find out later.
Well thats not good. Stomach has been hurting for the past 2 days and now I am slightly feverish.
Fortunately only ever so slightly.
Just sick it out nothing wrong with that. ofcourse it does make you feel like crap.
Also my apetite still works so cant be too severe.
MairBear why do you always end up logging into wow like 15 times in a row in the morning ?
He has too many alts.
Oh it pops up a thing every time you switch character ?
The extra 5 times are because I forget to do a thing v.
I've been listening to Random Access Memories the last couple days I think because it came up during Monday Exalted which Alchemicals so... yeah.
Contact is in the perfect medium imo.
Lizard Wizard's avatar got changed back =<.
Just when i thought the battleship movie was a bad idea.
The Battleship movie is honestly entertaining because how dumb it is.
I mean its not often you get to see a WW2 Battleship drift while fighting aliens.
Yeah but it was also dumb.
It was a stupid idea.
And the only way they could make it work.
Was to turn it into us army oohra veterans do you feel american enough yet shoot aliens.
Hence why its pretty entertaining.
Have some information about why pathfinder online is not a good game.
Coin which you have in your inventory is subject to this rule. Abadar credit bank credit is not. Visit Banks often to deposit your coin! ahaha.
When you die each item in your inventory has a 25% chance to be destroyed. Whatever remains will be placed in a â€œhuskâ€ which can be looted by any player one item at a time or recovered in one action by its character.
MoonWolf The Avenger was created by supporter Jerle.
They still okayed it!
MoonWolf I thought that died after EQ1.
Or maybe that was UO who did something like that.
Vanguard had leaving your stuff behind when you died but not people looting you.
Cooked_Auto nah PFO has like twice the polygons of UO!
A colleague for reasons I don't entirely understand is doing a course on equality diversity.
It seems... woeful >.>.
Apparently today he was informed that... let me dig out the email so I can quote it.
I wait with baited breath.
Crossdressing is not a term to be used any more... it is simply transgender.
I laughed for several minutes.
Punch whoever said that.
This is all mamals are cows levels of dumb.
I need to get one of those shirts.
That is some good cosplay.
The sweater is easy.
The badge is the hard part.
Nah pretty sure you can find that easily these days.
Well you can jus torder the sweater or something Close Enough.
Google for army sweater.
You're now two international shipments and some sewing away from xcom cosplay.
Only problem is that I don't have any conventions lined up to go to p.
TIL Icelandic-style patronymic surnaming is legal in Sweden again these days.
It was illegal ?
Okay i just found something dumb/cute.
If you go to that page hover over the barbarian icon at the top.
I'm unsure how two halves added up to 1.5.
That one time Great Cleave turns out to be useful.
Thts one hell of a cleave.
Thats took a weird turn.
Okay now that's just being lazy.
Twincest is best cest?
It's like they cloned jackie chan and gave them swords.
What. The. Fuck.
Homemade Apple Marshmallows Recipe hmmm.
Not sure if want.
Not sure if thats a thing i want in marshmellow.
Its not like Marshmallows barely taste anything anyway p.
Noelor bikes HOW DO THEY WORK.
The video before that is about the fact that bikes will keep going forward if you push them.
Yeah saw that one.
MoonWolf why is it hard to find a working kickass torrents website..
Because you live in the UK.
An elephant a rhinoceros and a horse reconstructed with the mistakes we often see in reconstructions of dinosaurs and other extinct animals.
Even if its somewhat exaggerated.
Horse one is 100% accurate.
Buying 3ds games - one for me one for brother's birthday he gets to pick.
Persona Q! for only £170.13 more get 11 Tarot Cards with it!
Which is like... the wrong number of tarot cards for basically anything.
You need a whole deck.
Not just the arcana.
Ok not buying this but.
This box art.
I find it odd that it shows all of their Shadows.
Its part of them!
You can't deny your shadow.
Not even if you're Peter Pan.
True but most of those people have dealt with them.
At least all of the P4 cast has overcome theirs. Also lol at Marie so far away from everyone as possible. Not even the cover designer likes her.
Anyone who doesn't already know guess what words that's supposed to be!
At least they're being honest vOv.
Ok not buying this but <- so not buying the best persona game.
I don't have a PSP.
Pretty sure its on ps3.
Also haven't played any of the core Persona games yet so.
Oh it totally is 3.
Nonetheless the other thing I said.
ChaosSmurf is WicDiv vol 2 out?
It looks pretty out on Amazon.
I hope this only just came out or I'll have to be mad at him for not telling me =/.
I'm on mumble if anyone cares.
Also MairBear i want to beat you up with legendaries.
Did someone say GotG?!
I love Mantis <3.
Here's a new Aston given you got the last one all shot up in the last movie.
That is literally the case in every Bond yes.
GlennCuddlefish MoonWolf Noelor.
It was only a matter of time.
From a grad recruitment listing On the outskirts of Chesterfield there are good links from Chesterfield.
!note ChaosSmurf ENERGY CAMEL.
Every Muton has a chance to ignore melee damage and instantly respond with a melee strike of their own. Rangers should keep this in mind when going in for the kill.
Um... ok then.
Noelor I just received the news after I'd turned off my PC last night that my brother's flight is tomorrow morning. So I might have to sit tonights game out to spend time.
MoonWolf enemyt played rivendare and sylvanas luckily i have enough to clear. Following turn they play two of the deathrattle resummon minion cards on mine and concede.
That... was an amazing opening if I didn't have those 2 exact cards.
Watched Steven Universe last night with some friends.
Cat fingers a disturbing episode.
The worst thing about japanese vesperia?
You know activating this thing in an unknown dungeon while there is a savepoint right there and not saving was not my best plan.
I assume it has japanese blablabla.
No blahblahblah at alll? D.
Blahblah = voiced skits?
In tales games spells have long incantations.
One of the characters can really speed up her casting times.
And then she just skips the incantation and goes blah blah blah.
I liked the incantations though.
Its a temporary buff.
She only goes blahblahblah in overlimit.
Which in theory doesn't last forever.
But for rita it sort of does.
Which is why rita is utterly broken.
This is dumb why isn't ctrl+a working on my irc client now.
7/10 let the overlimit speech get bast I'm so gonna make you-.
Oh no please dont tell me thats sword dancer.
Fffffuuuck its sword dancer. Good thing I went back and saved.
...and that I am way overleveled for this somehow.
And that it didnt have overlimits I was able to stunlock it with blahblahblah violent pain.
MairBear i am on the mumbles.
FF7 LP updated with part 1 of the final update.
So... now I have OWA stuck in my brain.
Could have worse things in there.
I had not realised it played at the quality it does on the PSX.
Assumed I was hearing a remaster I guess.
Minister did you recieve message? D.
Not by txt or Facebook or here no.
In summary will be out this evening. c.
GlennCuddlefish no game spend your evening getting better.
In longer form my brother recieved his flight ticket at midnight last night. It's tomorrow morning. So my time spending is consumed c.
Please stop dying firefox.
You are about to close 259 tabs... well that might explain it.
Oh sure crash 4 minutes after I shut down those tabs.
That's just how many tabs it was yo.
<- the happiest treant.
MoonWolf masaan raised an interesting point.
Coldarra drake + majordomo.
But hilarious all the same.
Might be fun at some point.
Not a plan i'm putting in my deck.
I am upset by that one.
Cooked_Auto Hogfather's so good.
Also what he said.
Anubis is a great guy.
Just looking our for your safety.
I'm sure I have heard this new dungeons music somewhere.
Just cant place it.
This is what skyrim makes us do.
Why is it dead ?
No idea this is an azure BM.
Been meaning to switch to one for IRC so ChaosSmurf can stop whining whenever I need to reboot my media box.
From the latest PoE patch.
>Fixed a bug where fire damage converted to chaos only affected maximum fire damage not minimum fire damage for fire damage that was converted from cold damage that had been converted from physical damage.
So if you had some physical damage that was converted to cold that was converted to fire it wouldn't properly affect minimum fire damage.
How did they even FIND that.
Only when that fire damage was then converted to chaos!
I'm not even sure how you would do all that!
Someone stacking a whole bunch of elemental damage auras ?
Those add not convert IIRC.
This is the description in the programmer's actual commit message. It deserved to be left unsimplified!
Apparantly + Cold to Fire +.
Man The Power Cosmic solves everything it seems.
Why else have it y'know?
If you have might as well use it.
At least that makes more sense than the time Dr Manhattan did the same.
Does it really ?
Well obviously that's the Power Cosmic.
That was a bigger explosion than i expected.
<- Brb starting a vegetarian drink bar.
Replace your hero power with a better one.
<- better hero powers.
I like how hunter got the worst upgrade.
Just one more damage.
Everyone else with a numeric value doubled.
What if aliens and humans switched roles.
Can't believe people are more interested in the Naga than the Tuskarr.
I guess they want it because it looks more badass.
And don't undesrtand hearthstone.
Noelor you know how in ffix sometimes there are sections with only steiner.
And they have music.
MoonWolf shaman one is dull.
Now you'll always roll spellpower when you need it.
No Sphere Grid No Summon No Customize No Overdrive No Escape No No Encounters No Blitzball. I just... I... what?
Here have some fate/collide les yay.
Softcore loli clonecest porn great.
Just what I needed.
Wheres smurf I kind of feel like fighting about rising thunder with somebody.
And I am sure smurf would be of the wrong opinion about this.
I don't even know what that is sorry.
Its a fighting game with questionable design choices.
Like one button specials.
My origin account will soon be an EA account? I didn't even know I had an origin account.
GlennCuddlefish cooldowns is a bit wtf.
One button specials just means no fucking 2 week learning to just fucking punch.
Just fucking punch isn't a special.
Unless you're one-punch man.
Noelor meanwhile in poppy I sure hope no magical pacermakers were anywhere near that dragon.
I have no idea wtf in Poppy.
Okay so do you know how magic and the possum anti magic works?
Magical fields and such.
I guess I forgot.
Okay so theres 2 parts. basically the brain affects how well you are...attuned to magic. How powerful you are with it.
And the heart spreads the field around you.
To the best of my understanding.
Since the possum brains are basically walking antimagic generators their fields mess with magic. And now look at what poppy's heart is doing.
The last like week of comics make way more sense now.
I guess I primarily had missed that possums had anti-magic auras I thought they were just... immune.
They just play possum and the magic ignores them.
I am not sure how usual actual auras like that are.
I know they make magic stop by touching it.
Anathema dyk this existed.
This anime has the worst imouto. and its one of my favorites this season for some reason.
Glenn watches anime.jpg.
Holding hands? How degenerate I.
Anathema Nishkriya seems dead.
It's a universal law that anyone calling themselves a Sorcerer King is probably a huge asshole and Blue Rose upholds that fine tradition by having them be brutal tyrants who were defeated three centuries ago.
The Exarchs' followers give them grand improbable titles and engage in unspeakable rites. So basically they're Abyssal Exalted. Hah.
And then one of them is named Yungo. Wtc.
Left 4 Skaven looks okay.
Noelor derp forgot v.
Well that's horrifying.
Noelor if you were using nishkriya.theanathema.com then yes if nishkriya.com then wat.
Anathema stop moving it!
Noelor it has been nishkriya.com for aaaages.
I should have made nishkriya.theanathema.com a proper 301 instead of just pointing to the same box |.
Noelor I fixed the url just for you.
And thats why scotland is such a shithole.
Look how that worked out for the persians.
Anathema I totally used to have it as .com.
Then it broke and you said to switch to anathema.com.
I said the exact opposite!
No but ages ago!
Cooked_Auto just for me could you please tag kindle covers as such?
I'll just stick to linking the page itself then.
1037 and thats why scotland is such a shithole <--- u wot m8?
For your new hardcore race mode we will kill players as they spawn.
Maybe they should learn to pay attention D.
Wish I'd joined that last night instead of farmed warbands.
Huh this is actually a game too.
With a number of expansion.
Such as we didn't playtest this either.
Yeah I looked it up on Boardgame geek.
But what is it ?
Monk vs Wizard.
MairBear GOOD PRIEST CARDS.
Also best priest tier set.
On the art I mean.
So it's baically a slower lightwarden.
Its a tazdingo without taunt.
Its not going to win games.
But its a priest card you can just put on the board.
And that is something priests lack.
Still the best dragon.
Your face isn't a dragon.
And i hope to keep it that way.
However if i have a cold and really empty my nose.
Thats a dragon according to pokemon.
Well in their defense.
So ditto is a dragon?
MairBear NOW THIS CARD.
Why can't any of you like good games.
This card is just O_o.
The point being that purple is not a normal colour for nasal fluids.
MairBear shit so I should see a doctor about this?
Or just stop snorting lavender powder.
But its so soothing.
It will not make you a dragon.
No matter how much you ingest.
If it was just minions generated instead of ALL CARDS.
All the cards forever.
Have they added surnames to WoW yet?
Nor can I see that happening.
<- oh and this one.
But not as exciting as master summoner.
God blizzard all you need to do is allocate another ~30 bytes of storage for every character that exists how much can that be!?
Anathema well actually quite a bit.
Is it worth the effort ?
Unless I math'd wrong.
Okay thats literal bytes on drives.
But databases don't work that way.
MoonWolf if fizzlebang summons Jarraxus.
Yeah they are really efficient.
It would probably be less than that.
And there's no special trifling gnome sound effect...
I wonder what DB they use.
I bet its Oracle.
MairBear if fizzlebang summons jarraxus it should get autoplayed.
Sure its a bit of a downside.
In which case for 15 character names it could be upto 45 bytes.
But think of the lore.
Anathema it can't be Oracle.
Anathema i doubt its oracle.
How does WoW still work?!
Which is why people will pay millions of pounds for it.
The thing you use Minister is made in some RAD package that basically lets you create some forms that sit directly over a DB.
It is not rad.
Assuming its the same thing I used at university.
It is not rad at all.
Like the access of oracle databases.
Now we know why wow subcription costs are still so high.
Never happier my sub fell over.
Found this cute avatar on the SA forums.
Gaaah back to work and social stress.
Back to designing this API.
MairBear people are angry wilfred fizzlebang is a card.
Becuase then he wont be the alt warlock hero.
'Arnold said If you sleep more than 6hour per night I suggest you learn to sleep faster '.
Huh apparantly when Win10 hits xbox1 you will be able to stream Steam games to it.
Kinda one an xbox1.
Even though I'll need a PS4 for the next Earth Defence Force game anyway.
Does xbone have any decent exclusives?
Nobody has exclusives these days but Nintendo.
We have exclusivly not on pc too.
This blog owner is the sort of person I have to work with.
Anathema i thought you worked stockmarket adjacent.
And not the soup kind.
Ham is a commodity.
Wait for it.
Welp bought a 500GB SSD should arrive tomorrow.
If win10 is out in 5 days I'm guessing the latest insider build available will be an RTM build that will patch to retail?
Or it is on MSDN.
The build i'm running now is RTM.
There might be another build that actually gets pushed out but i doubt it'll have any noticable differences.
Just some more obscure edge case fixes.
Heee final build number is 10240.
Can only see 10074 on MSDN though.
There must be an iso you cna find somewhere.
They were rolling out builds through windows update sounds like once it launches you can choose to convert your insider build to a retail build if you either upgraded from 7 or 8.1 or can get a key.
So I can install it tomorrow and just grab a key off msdn when it launches.
I'm just keeping mine to insider builds.
Am on mumble if you wanna chat.
You have until the Epilogue chapter is done which should take a while longer. I'm not particularly in a rush right now. I have some very cool things planned for it and now that the LP is done I do intend to take my time to get them right.
Anathema help.
P sure this is a hoax image.
No I think that's how it's been.
Ana and I have decided that the only way that's possible is if Trident happened and the icon over Glasgow is actually a nuclear explosion.
So RIP Glasgow I guess.
Come talk to us on mumble.
I need to work.
This is a yawn.
Does anyone else watch bojack horseman?
Its a dark comedy cartoon on netflix.
Does that link to a page.
With lots of images.
What would be the difference to current twitch?
Yeah this seems to be more my speed.
Cooked_Auto just use the katanza.
I am. It's pretty much my main weapon and yet the Shaman takes fucking ages to kill.
MoonWolf my first gold card after returning to Hearthstone just showed up in a GvG booster! It was Target Dummy.
Getting sub 2MB/s read speeds from my spinning rust drive I feel this should not happen.
This link still working?
Oh nevermind it loaded for me.
On some random hotel internet so gonna be a fun day of work.
Why are you in a random hotel ?
Fighting game event in edinburgh that I wanted to be at.
Actually playing or just observing?
They're meant to have a V set up that I'll just omp tho.
Why am I looking at fight sticks? I cant afford one anyway so why am I doing this to myself.
Because you want to treat yoself.
Gdq its BIG.
It's hard it's out of control!
I want that mixing table.
I have no idea what I would use it for but I want it.
Man I am greedy today.
GlennCuddlefish he has another video of that mixing table on his channel somewhere where he just messes with the preset buttons.
3000 dollars well spent.
Well that certainly sounds like a game.
Tembo the badass elephant.
Made by the pokemon devs.
Guess I will give it a try.
Made by the pokémon devs published I think by Sony.
That's what I meant even.
I only just woke up fingers are dumb.
Currently in my recommended Steam curators Hella Yuri.
Its not just a little Yuri.
Literally just a list of all games on Steam with romance options that have any degree of ff pairings.
Thats hardly hella yuri.
Disney The Princess and the Frog.
A short kiss-tag minigame means you can kiss your girl friends but there's no animation of the kiss just sparkles and frog transformation.
But the games are hella yuriglasses.
Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble!™.
One character you can have in your gang definitely prefers girls but there's no option for her to date them within the game.
Good thing about yuri is that even little will make you go all doki doki.
Speaking of which how about that latest poppy noelor.
Noelor okay this is someone mentioned a thing in one sentence at some point.
When did morbi get this quick at updating.
That lion seems p cool.
Thats the squall i know.
Rather than someone who socializes and gives people tours.
Socialise is a strong word.
He chose not to ignore someone who he'd just knocked over.
Sounds to me he was thinking of Kingdom Hearts 2.
Or was that 1 even?
Yeah ok this is paying off.
And to be clear Quistis has IcyNips. because of course.
Oh yes! Taking care of your GF. This is something you have to watch out for. Quistis reminding us that relationships take work.
I'd like to believe that Squall is getting a reputation for walking around Garden just listening to people talk like a weirdo.
Quistis is 18. and a sexy teacher.
At least she's 18.
Zell seems like a dick.
With a tatto like that? He is.
Sometimes in Final Fantasy VIII you can forget to set your junctions but thankfully there's a gameplay feature that revolves around this. It's called getting your ass kicked and reloading your save.
Noelor its very effective.
Angry protesters chase Scotland's only Tory MP out of town after he turned up to open a food bank.
Watch the first minute.
A score of 100 would drop to 70 if you don't save the dog. legit.
I'm sorry the what.
They have a t-rex in the training center.
Because if you want a relatively safe training environment why not add a t-rex in there.
Alright time to upgrade.
Junctioning gives silly stats is what I'm learning.
MoonWolf did you see 2 days ago trolden o.o.
The nozdormu exploit specifically.
Why the wings?
Gay marriages don't involve flying on wings of light where you're from?
<- glenn gets buff and visits a photo gallery.jpg.
So I gave my TSW character a haircut. Not too sure about the results still.
Wonder if FFXIV runs on this computer.
Only one way to find out.
Aye waiting for the benchmark to download now.
Well try running ffi through ffxiii make a note of how well they do then extrapolate your performance curve.
BwaS a reasonable solution indeed.
Santa claus has died.
So apparantly my motherboard supports SATA3 but I did not plug the new drive into a SATA3 port I'm not sure how to tell which is which...
Windows 10 sure is pretty though.
Wat there is a context menu item to calculate sha-1 and sha-256 hashes that's amazing.
I helpfully colour coded the cables when I installed them it seems hooray for foresight.
Anathema I haven't gotten a notification for win 10 <.
Anathema pretty sure thats 7zip.
This elephant game seems great. pity this cracker version refuses to proceed after the first mission.
MoonWolf oh that makes sense.
Moth just wait 4 days.
MoonWolf mein mutter has already recieved a notification about it on her laptop.
Had it ever since I returned from Stockholm just hide.
Oh yeah I had some gravity falls I needed to watch. Since my friends are butts.
Watching some heroes casting the casters being exceptionally irritating.
Everything about them seems to be sycophantry with eachother constantly agreeing and going indeed!
Thats the glue phrasing of casters who are not very good.
I don't know how to pick up from what he just said so i'll just generically agree.
...guys... You need to stop eating the dice. |.
MairBear how many more ways would you like to roll a d6?
Man its absurd how much more diffficult it is to draw a straight line on computer for me.
I want to be able to do it with just the power of thought.
I'll make a TODO entry.
2342 ...guys... You need to stop eating the dice. | <- but they're so tasty!
ChaosSmurf I had not realised Gods Monsters was a series.
Oh nm this is shorts I'm awful.
I thought they made it into a movie later.
Yeah the movie is what I was looking for.
I botched my searching.
Anyway GlennCuddlefish reminded me I have a bit of Gravity Falls to catch up on.
Think I last saw Soos and the Real Girl...
You're in for a treat.
Ok I'd also seen this episode with handwitch and Neil DeGrass Bacon.
GlennCuddlefish that was one hell of a plot episode right after I stopped watching.
By which I mean probably a couple months after I stopped watching.
GlennCuddlefish Dipacifica is the dumbest ship.
I wish mumble wasn't hosted on sourceforge.
Sourceforge is turning into a bit of a shithole recently.
ChaosSmurf i like how the donation tracker broke in the first hour.
Damn where does mumble store your certificate...
Wherever you save it afaik.
Did it break or just not set up at all yet?
No the donation tracker.
They've not clarified exactly how.
Alienware goons broke it because they didnt advertise enough.
Think I need to check the 'recognised non-native accents for this language' in the speech settings? p.
That depends if you were drinking that day.
Thats an actual setting now?
A thing i just disabled.
Well yes but you're native.
No i mean cortana.
Cortana/okay google/siri are dumb gimmicks.
Says the person who has never used them!
Because they are gimmicks!
Yoshi's island has some pretty solid programming.
Says the guy breaking the game over its knee.
The other night a friend was trying to ask siri something siri kept getting the speech to text wrong.
Meanwhile I was on wolfram opposite side of the room and had the answer in half the time.
I think I've used the google one twice.
Was wondering why there were so many people watching yoshis island on twich SGDQ just started.
And in Drakengard Betrayal! Again.
And shit gets whack.
Cooked_Auto he was the only one that hadn't betrayed us yet!
I dont think Decadus has done that yet actaully.
Well he's probably up next then.
This is the last path but who knows.
I'm actually having fun in PvP in WoW....
By just RULES OF NATUREing into the entire enemy team.
<--- the result of shaman trying to rules of nature.
Nothing lewd going on here.
Mairnai hardcore rules of naturing right there.
Well checked this anime out. There is now a woman threatening to expose herself if any of the law officers come any closer. Also throwing porn pamphlets around.
Well its a world where no dirty jokes and sexual innuendo apparently exists.
What a terrible dystopia.
Indeed good thing we have the MC and his waifu to solve that issue.
Don't come any closer.
I once sold somebody on Drakengard by calling it a heart-warming romance between two unlikely heros Hah.
On no they blew up THE pool.
Glenn You mean THAT pool?
This show is whack.
When I started watching anime of high schoolers living out a zombie uprising I didn't really expect this...
I can take moe bt this is bonkers.
High school of the dead ?
At least that's what crunchy's calling it.
Seems to be the actual title.
Today's Gengar design is p cool.
Is there more than 10 episodes of Gravity Falls s2?
Err. Which is episode 10?
Pretty sure there are at least 2 after that.
Also didn't realise that 'Zeus' was spelled 'Soos' in it.
I feel I should not be enjoying this show so much.
Somehow this person has a worse mother than ragyo. At least ragyo didn't take people's lewd away.
How do you take someones lewd away.
Well banning of pornography fahrenheit style censuring of internet eradication of sex education 24/7 surveillance where you get arrested for even mentioning genitalia.
Well this escalated quick.
Well that's depressing.
One of the nicest parts of glasgow.
Less than I pay atm.
Did...Did he just insult square pizza.
This fan picture has now officially ruined the entire show for me.
Well not the last bit with the emotions stuff.
But the hating square pizza.
Man everyone else who runs games at my FLGS is flakey as shit.
So I now have a tweet in my feed that is supportive to Hulk Hogan... specifically a black man insisting that Hulk isn't racist.
Which seems odd to me.
Y'all need to watch BoJack Horseman one of the best shows to come out recently.
I've been tempted to just because Will Arnett.
I don't think I can stress how good it is.
But also dark as fuck.
And filled with puns.
So SunTiger will hate it.
Because he hates fun.
Also dumb gimmicks like horses.
But how can you say neigh to something like that?
Source of a great deal of quality horse-related humour.
Like Neal McBeal the Navy SEAL.
Who is an actual seal.
How do you live with yourself SunTiger? not like animal-based puns.
Quite comfortably to be honest.
I think you need help.
You could help by not making animal puns.
There's a fucking brutal eliajah wood / daniel radcliff joke in towards the end of s2 it's so good.
WHY DOES CANTALOPE THINK WHENEVER IT GETS INVITED TO A PARTY IT CAN BRING ITS LAME FRIEND HONEYDEW.
YOU DONT GET A PLUS 1 CANTALOPE.
Fruit salads man. honeydew ruins them.
I disagree with your premise.
Also pretty sure making it all caps ruins jokes.
It is yelled in the show.
Then the same can be said about yelling.
Well it works if you're Gilbert Gottfried or have a funny voice for it but otherwise its just lame.
Maybe you should actually watch the fucking show before saying it doesn't work and talking out of arse as usualy jesus fuck.
That sensation you're having while reading that is a bit of your soul dying.
I was talking in general fuckface |.
Which is just as stupid a thing to say.
Do you guys want some chips for your salt or just a room?
Wouldnt a room made out of salt just be a salt mine?
Nah salt used to go in a cellar.
Back when it was the only means of preserving food.
Yeah but that room wouldnt be made out of salt. Just have salt.
So its clearly not the same thing.
I stopped taking my medication on friday may be a little out of whack.
That gif is unfamiliar to me new psychopass stuff? O.
That gif is pure anime whatever it is.
Well it's definitely psycho-pass because of that gun.
I'm going to assume the movie I haven't s- aha!
Are they as valuable as nectar points?
...are they actually valuable?
I think they aren't.
I was running with that as the joke but on reflection do not actually know.
Right well taking your original intent they are about that valuable yes.
Also having only watched about the first dozen of steven universe if that... Pearl seems to get the bulk of good lines.
Perl is the best she is named after a programming language.
Pearl is great she makes me feel well-adjusted.
That is easily the third time I've said that.
And wont be the last.
Im just assuming the reason why she gets a lot of the good lines is because writing that kind of character is just fun vOv.
Its a shame her voice is not as good as Garnet's.
Garnet is my actual favourite but why is spoilers.
They're all actually my favourite including Ronaldo.
Oh except the donut shop guy.
This seems unfair. Also somewhat creepy.
Also a bit dumb.
Well that was implied.
GlennCuddlefish This almost seems to be your thing.
Sword Symphonium is the game in question.
Kids flew to Amsterdam to take drugs Really now?
I lost it at.
The prettiest zombie slaying princess.
Well thats a relief here I thought MGS5 wouldnt have weird shit in it.
THe first half of that entire episode was insane.
...did you not finish it yet?
Also did you see Giant Woman yet?
I just finished it also giant woman.
I can't remember what order episodes happen in.
I think that was immediately before.
Eeeugh <- what game even is this ?
Giant Woman is why otp becomes otf when I talk about SU.
As much as Im for removing the colorfilter from FONV having it that bright is a bit too much.
Though Ana may not have seen it.
I have not seen past cat fingers.
Turtles are such bros.
Or is it a selfish survival trait ?
Turtles are such selfish survivalist bros.
Dave guy comes with Taxes.
It's one of those days in Britain.
When it rains so much I look out the window and for a second think it's stopped.
Or rains so little for that part.
Then realise that no my brain has just spotted seeing it.
And you have to angle your head just to see the raindrops against something.
Because it's that embedded into the background.
Well Onion is terrifying.
Thats basically onion in a nutshell.
I still cant help but to be amused that tg all of a sudden has TSW general threads.
And as far as we know his parents are pretty okay people.
So its just an onion thing.
So its no longer weekend.
Where are my HS card reveals blizzard.
SunTiger idk about Yellowtail man.
Sour cream is a bit awkward but otherwise perfectly normal!
MairBear someone decided this needed to be written.
This reminds me of that dota thing.
Includes detailed rules on when you may use emotes.
About playing to win.
And when its okay to play more cards then neeeded to win the game.
THreaten should be used rarely.
And in a friendly way.
As a paladin player I am confused with all these emotes. Isn't Well met the only one?
Thank you commenters.
The Light Shall Burn You *heals opponents max hp face*.
Now THATS a sniper rifle.
Look at that thing.
MairBear also constant use of ironic to mean sarcastic.
But only after having called something else sarcastic suggesting there is a difference.
~SunTiger now THATS a sniper rifle - Jeesus Anti-Mat rifle with doublesided mags.
The scope looks undersized though.
Also the word ironical.
Cooked_Auto xcom 2 has customizable bits to items.
Worst part of that is probably the stock.
So the double mag is probalby custom.
Maybe the scope too.
It looks ridiculously short.
Or at least you can probably find a much BIGGER scope.
For like +aim or more distance.
Then agai with XCOMs distances a 10x scope is overkill so a 4x one would make sense.
Thats uhm not how the logic works ingame.
Also you basically need an anti material rifle against some of the fucking literal robots.
But using a 4x scope would make a lot of sense in the context of the game compared to a 10-20x scope since no sniper is really going to sit a kilometer away plinking at the bots.
I've had snipers basically a map distance away in the dam map.
So far away the game can't zoom far out enough to show the target and the sniper.
Yeah but that's still not a kilometer plus apart only like 300 meters or something.
Granted I'm guilty of rocking an Anti-Mat rifle with a 4x scope in Arma 3 but it's really fucking handy when your bunker is surrounded by mines that need to be popped.
So many mines. So many goddamn mines.
So someone is making a Ms Marvel audio drama. Not to sold on Kamala's voice though.
Huh didn't know this was a thing either vOv.
Tap dat waifu.
Hell man flying mouse warrior!
MairBear in the grim dark future of 2016 wiafu's enjoy being poked the in the face with a stylus ?
Snakes don't have any arms _.
0849 also didn't realise that 'Zeus' was spelled 'Soos' in it <- it is spelt Soos but should be 'sus.
Which is really close to zus in dutch.
One of the summons in the FF8 LP is called SquarEnix.
Oh god Pearl went into some kind of overdrive. Amethyst is not helping.
Or is Amethyst completely helping?
Also you're not even on S2 yet probably so.
Amethyst is making a pile of stuff asymmetrical.
Hahahahaha <- this is me reacting to you thinking Pearl is in overdrive in S1.
When does season 2 start?
We're well into it by now.
In terms of episode numbers I mean o.
You'll know when you've reached the finale of S1 though.
I just got my first helping of plot too I think.
Actual serious things happening in SU.
As opposed to just Amethyst providing fanservice.
This being not anime.
I..... must not have got the the amethyst fan service yet.
That's not a thing.
Cooked_Auto Kamala should sound more Jersey I agree.
Apparently this is her VA though.
Yesterday when I said the anime escalated quick I wasn't kidding. also spoilers for that lewd dystopia anime.
Cooked_Auto well yes it's good they got someone of the right ethnicity some wouldn't and claim it didn't matter because audio.
But she doesn't sound pakistani or jerseyan totes the demonym.
THe words at least the ocean will never leave me come to mind.
Time to take a break from serious cartoons.
And watch serious cartoons the gravity falls one I've not watched yet.
There is no escape Glenn.
Ehh. Not going to get me back into the game tbh.
Witcher 3 was nice and all but it also kinda dragged on for a bit too long in the end.
>Doing missions in Egypt in TSW near a pyramid and dealing with the gods >Not listening to Powerslave. >What am I doing.
Not really worth playing through twice but the first playthrough is fun.
PS Squall is dead.
Nobody liked you anyway squall.
MairBear here have a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE CARD.
Why is this card a thing.
Why would i want that.
Because Brode hates good cards?
Maybe there are cards that do things when you summon?
Maybe you use that as a heal because it's a cheap card that's pretty tanky for its cost?
I'm not saying it's good mind.
Its a 5 mana resummon.
Also there are only 4 spaces left in the cards revealed page.
And if you ever want to NOT get him off the field you deny yourself your hero power.
4 mana if you have Lady of the Lake! I think that's the one.
Anyway the way i see it right now.
Many of the cards shown off in thie expansion are good in theory.
If hearthstone in general slows down it'll work.
That card is STILL TOO SLOW.
MairBear i know right.
I don't know what they were thinking.
The only thing i like about that card is the possibility of other GOOD CARDS that can return to your hand through some trigger.
Maybe if it had a battlecry too.
We need another thing with all the cards that come out.
A developer need to give a frank discussion about wtf they were thinking.
Whenever they present a card.
Boo monday.
But it's over! We're almost at Tuesday now! HURRAH!
Yay it's basically christmas!
This is how my youngest brother figures its almost his birthday.
9 months away from his birthday.
Someone posted on bookface how it was only 20 Fridays until Christmas the other day ffs none of that.
But you're Jesus you like christmas.
Do I look like Jesus?!
Just think in five Christmases I'll be 30.
The hell is up with that.
Thats what time does.
I'm holding you personally responsible SunTiger.
When you turn 30 I'm going to get you so sloshed on mead that you do believe you're Jesus and we then pillage the nearest village as viking jesuses.
On one of my rare visits to Twitter an artist I followed posted something like draw your comic we'll all be dead soon and its relevancy crushed my soul.
Meadilith shalt never be unleashed.
Edilith Just think in five Christmases I'll be 30 - At least you have fine. I've got two.
Wtf would have happened if you weren't there KaunMoth.
We'd have to pick you up at the nearest police station and someone would owe me even more money.
But Cooked_Auto everyone knows guys are like cheese and get more awesome as they age.
I must be a rare exception then p.
You'd drunkenly call me giggling and talking nonsense and I'd be forced to come get you Edilith ?
I would have gotten kidnapped.
Headlines idiot abroad gets drunk willingly gets kidnapped 'for a laff'.
Nah just have T repeatedly shout about face sitting.
I sure do collect weirdos as friends.
Oh my god edilith cant you get any younger.
NO THAT'S THE PROBLEM GLENNY.
YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME.
If she was cute I'd do it.
AND DONT YOU MEAN WHEN.
FUCK TIME AT GLENNYS PLACE.
But not as a crone.
I DON'T HAVE THAT MANY PHALLUS..ES.
GLENNY HOW ARE YOU OMG <3.
CHOP CHOP THOSE DICKS AINT GONNA ASSEMBLE THEMSELVES.
You are a sicko.
Telling a lady on the internet the word 'dicks'.
You should be ashamed.
I am sorry. Man popsicles.
I somehow did not expect that.
Glenny you are a sick fuck.
Meat's back on the menu boys!
Someone give me something to draw that isn't dicks meat or Jesus related.
No I won't draw Jesus boning a ham joint.
I don't know what either of those is.
Irish mythology horse looking creature that lures people/rides people into a lake to drown them.
Like most horses they are assholes.
I haven't met many asshole horses.
There's a pony for all occasions!
Is thre a pony for there not being a pony for the occasion?
Like getting dragged into the sea and drowned and then having your bloated waterlogged corpse eaten.
Kelpie is the pony for that.
GlennCuddlefish no in that instance you use a sad apologetic-looking cuttlefish.
I need to play that.
In fact I am downloading it as we speak.
Apparently it's on PC.
Came out last week.
Well that and I liked some of the previous way of the samurai games.
How the dicks did they *both* walk away from that? o.0.
Likely the biker walked down the road and then suddenly all his internal organs exploded.
You know what I'm not fine not fine at all in fact I'm in a lot of pain and I think my pancreas just exploded *pop* oh there went my spleen aw shit.. is my liver slowly dripping out of my anus now? Welp guess I'm dead.
Rinoa's dad's first name is Fury.
How drunk were the parents?
So i'm fighting the penultimate boss of BG1 Tales of the Sword Coast.
Very dramatic fight indeed.
...chrome won't open bmps in-browser.
Viconia hits the boss once with a mace that has a chance to instakill undead things.
I was planning on her distracting the boss and had the rest of the party up at the entrance because there was going to be ads and wanted to kill those before they murdered my back line.
And my party is buffed TO THE GILLS.
And viconia just ends it.
Nah get away.
Im pretty sure that's not how bullets work.
No part of that.
I have made this thing!
Also known as dinner.
SunTiger The kind of hardcore RPG player that genuinely wants the chance of throwing away 30 hours of game on a mistake is tough enough to have their own entry on the Mohs scale.
GlennCuddlefish that's an early dinner.
Edilith waterpony! The squishy ride of your life that ends in a murky depth strangled by seaweeds.
Banned in water polo.
Noelor sounds about right.
School-Live! is getting nge levels of ptsd it's hilarious.
I couldn't watch that it looked like it was too depressing.
Instead I'll just watch this comfy daily lives anime and oh god why.
This shot included so you can see Seifer poking Squall in the dick with his gunblade.
Selphie the fun one.
So I am watching a stream of darkest dungeons.
This player has somehow won the favor of RNG gods.
He just blitzed through the dungeon floor.
He got ambushed? No worries surprise round. Somehow.
Kill 4 dogs? 4500 gold.
Going to look at dota2's TI after binging on HotS past few months.
Our cat keeps bringing us dead animals. But here's the kicker they're not dead yet V.
It brings rodents into the house. And they turn out to be just dazed and then escape.
You'll never learn to kill rodents if she only brings you dead ones.
What you need to do is kill one and show your cat that you did it.
So Garnet just pretended to be Mom Universe.
That was a thing.
Theres a dude named Jet Jenkins.
I mean what else could you call them?
I know I named my 100% japanese samurai Hank Zappa.
Well this assassination quest escalated quickly.
Tetris block was definitly worth it.
SunTiger 3 kel'thuzads new meta?
Guess i'm playing twisting nether warlock to counter 3 kt meta.
As written by youtubed auto caption?
Current impediment to watching Stephen Universe.
I don't really like Stephen.
This is the fight after initiative this is the duel rocky and keen.
Well that was somewhat unsatisfying.
I ran into some super duelist on the street. Took me 2 weapons to win this duel and then they just ran away.
I think they ran out of stamina. Lucky too since the next move on that combo would have destroyed me.
....The real life of Glenn is very exciting.
I didn't know that thing happened in finland but it makes sense.
Is there anything particularly good due at sgdq this year?
Your face is scheduled to appear on Friday.
Now that the tetris block is done i think all the super amazing stuff is over.
I should complete Pillars of Eternity.
That's the thing about eternity you can't complete it.
Well I'm fucked. My primary weapon is almost broken. The blacksmith is closing down and I apparently killed his successor earlier on when he had been hired to act as muscle for some goons.
Well that certainly was a fight. I ended up killing 2 times as many enemies in that one fight than I had in the whole game previously.
Minister weak year imo.
Stupid spotify shuffle algorithm keeps picking songs about feels _.
No more zombies instead they turn you into an egg.
That turns into 3 cryssalids!
Is that the secret third class?
SunTiger exclusive class reveal.
That is the most misleading title I've seen in.
Its a class of monster.
Cheers though can be a news story tonight.
Good enough say the editors at ign.
The future of waifusims.
I got arrested after a constable decided to run in front of my box kicking routine and then I was dragged off into somekind of BDSM dungeon.
Life of a samurai was more whack than I expected.
Having now read it.
That article is so weirdly worded SunTiger.
It looks like neither the interviewer nor the developer have english as a first language for some reason.
I think its a symptom of trying to milk out many more words than they really had ?
They awnser the same questin about 5 times.
Makes sense to me.
There wasn't any need for more than the first paragraph.
And the whole tone of the piece is fucked by the SEO they've applied to it.
I wonder if some idiot thought it WAS the latest class and they had to hastily fix it.
Yrel's command or as my dad says whyrul.
Your dad's a bit of a hero.
Don't encourage him C.
Today I discussed odd phrases in a dutch to swedish phrasebook with a guy.
? Anyone interested in a tactical RPG with vikings? And developed in Dutchland too.
Cooked_Auto good pilot earned his pay that day.
Probably not very happy.
SunTiger idle thought what level of resist fire would be reasonable for an alternate racial feat on Ember?
Given racial feat is champion feat.
That is one hell of a question.
Current racial feat makes the racial minor action fireblast hit 1d3 targets.
Yo windows 7 users get this free upgrade to 10 as well right?
I haven't imagined that.
So it's not super-duper-great.
If its a legit copy of win 7 yes.
Atronach is just re-skinned dragonkin.
Right so i'm doing this on the fly and since its a direct combat thing i don't want to horribly miss balance this.
Anyway there best source of how much resistance costs investment wise is in the sorcerer class.
Which has a bunch of talents and feats for that.
For 1 talent and 1 adventurer feat they can gain 12+ to 2 resistance.
And 1 talent 1 adventurer and 1 champion they can get one 16+ and 12+.
So here is the deal i'm going to offer you.
12+ to two or 16+ to one.
16+ to fire it is.
Because Ember not having fire resistance seems off.
Because you're investing a champion feat.
But you don't have two feats.
Which seemed like i should aim somewhere in the middle ?
Yeah s'fair I dunno what second element I'd take.
Because Tamriel has just the three right?
And they don't have a resistance triangle afaik.
They don't have a triangle and they don't have a codified Elemental Set.
But elemental combat magic tends to be fire frost ice.
And those are the canonical atronach varieties too yeah?
Yes though we've seen some unusual atronachs throughout the games.
I'll fix her sheet when I get back.
Well its been a while since I ran into an escort this infuriating.
So I have to protect this NPC as you do in escort missions.
From some dozens of angry enemies with swords.
The NPC runs around the map without any warning dies from what seems like too few hits.
And DOES NOT SHOW UP ON THE MINIMAP.
I take that back I was just an idiot.
You can actually order the NPC to follow you.
Death to escort missions.
Now to go and see pantsman.
Mu this dragon just keeps getting worse in poppy.
Like this is seriously one of the more horrifying things I have seen in a webcomic.
Man Charlotte had a very impressive opening ep. Definitely worth checking out.
Meanwhile Fate/Collide s3e1 was a more of the same affair.
More basically porn ?
Verdict on pantsman pretty solid.
Anathema> I don't really like Stephen <- he gets better in s2 imo.
He doesn't start very likable.
I like Stephen.
He's a lil' bitch tho.
That'll be why you're a fan.
And I like Steven in like the abstract.
I like what he represents?
Looking at a list of products online one is a keyfob.
ChaosSmurf I bought WickDiv2 today.
Last copy on my flcs' shelf!
Welcome to castle Dwarfhall home to the humans who have come to the dwarves aid. v.
That is one manly chin.
That shit is fucking CHIZZLED.
Noelor I haven't read it yet.
I'm excited to do so.
There is a panel Huh. We have a landline?
SunTiger Oh no. Not him. Why the fuck did Drizzt have to show up already.
I knoooow. But still.
Seconds later another goddamn random meeting.
Man this is the worst pizza I have ever made.
Gameplay note She's got some pretty sweet swords yadda yadda yadda LETS GET OUT OF HERE. Hah.
I love how this one is smooshed in between the usual LoZ shirts.
My Deathly Hallows tee showed up yesterday.
Dota2 is weird it's had years to itself and I'm looking at all their heroes and spotting the base wc3 asset.
Otherwise Dota players wouldn't recognise them.
SunTiger whose FF9 thread are you following again?
Oh it is that one cool.
You gave the man a swingset you foooools.
This is neat.
For some reason I thought it was someone you used an acronym fro.
Orange fluffy sheep does a level 1 run inside of it.
Cooked_Auto hardly he ran towards it.
Well they let him run towards it.
Like somehow I have created a pizza that tastes only like flour and salt.
How did I even do this.
That's pretty neat.
GlennCuddlefish not enough uh...
What else is even in pizza.
In the dough not much else.
But there are a lot of toppings on this.
Like 2 types of cheese the usual tomato sauce tuna.
And a type of sourcream because why not.
But somehow they cancel each other out.
Not sure if actual china or just japanese chinatown.
Where my Genki at D.
Also han'on a sec isn't there 7 of em?
Yeah Genki Sudo is in credits as lyricist and director.
But is not actually in footage.
... you know their names? nerrrrd p.
I know the main guys name. XD.
But that's cos I thought World Order was a song.
And Genki Sudo was the band...
Ah yes having gone back to another one I know who mean.
Also yay finally earned my nerd.
Glasses dude who clearly wouldn't take no shits from nobody.
And was also a kickboxer.
Or some form of no-shit-taking ring fights.
Free melon bread is almost as good as supernatural power.
What if free melon bread was a supernatural power ?
The best dragon.
Oh my god.
Actually good cards for grand tournament.
Drone racing is actually pretty cool.
SunTiger Zero is a harsh but fair reviewer.
Cooked_Auto clear communication is key in a long term relationship.
Indeed not that I believe it'll be such a long-lasting relationship.
....So I just ran into myself.
GlennCuddlefish you shouldn't sprint near mirror.
There werent any mirrors around.
I was on some road in the woods.
And then bumped into myself.
And we had a duel.
Still not sure if game or real life.
Well no Finland has one less troll in their forests.
Either I wasn't aware trolls could shapeshift or rude.
So for the upcoming 5th edition DD game me and a friend are making monks.
From the same school.
We are thinking of colling our style jan-ken poxing.
Goddamn this pizza even defies the first law of pizza Yesterdays pizza is always better.
It still doesnt taste like anything.
Not use salt ?
Somehow all the toppings just nullify each other.
Anathema oh god don't get me started on classical music tagging / sorting.
Its a fucking MESSSS.
Just stuff on my computer alone in foobar2000 becomes a wreck.
Yeah I've just put that all in Classical music.
Yeah but i like to sort my music in playlists by artist - album.
Only really stuck with broad categories for everything beyond sorting after artist but my god fuck trying to categorize it correctly.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
Yeah have fun with that.
Mine is just sectioned after type like Anime/VGM/'Normal Music' and so on.
If i have a single cd that is a cohesive bit of classical music.
It should shwo up as such.
But i don't kno how to make that happen automatica.
And I'm off to the local boardgame cafe as per usual now. Saves me from hearing my parents put new floor in the living room P.
You wanna know how shit I feel atm? I almost didn't go to the gym yesterday! and when I did go I couldn't even do my usual routine! and that was after a buttload of sleep and food!
Maybe take a sick day!
You're allowed to use them.
I considered it but if I take a sick day I can't go to the gym.
Friend on Facebook asking for help fixing little girls who like pink too much =V.
I think he's being facetious... I hope.
Either he's joking or he's a monster.
Susan and by extension Dan taking movies very seriously.
I have an email from a Michele.
Because of being Irish maybe?
I really like this episode.
SU certainly loves to lull you into thinking an episode is done and then just subtly slip in something plot.
<- sounds about accurate.
Tavern brawl's repeating? C.
Great rag vs nef.
Just lost as nef >.>'.
Done with this weeks brawl.
Launcher said something about portals.
I wonderr if this is a mistake.
This is definitly not one i wanted to repeat.
Certainly not this fast.
I could have gone for another round of bananas or spells summon creatures.
<- it was a mistake.
Pretty sure that Netrunner is almost more popular than Magic at the cafÃ©.
I mean there is magic played but people were playing NTR dohohoho almost the entire time I was there today.
Unlike Glenn's pizza the pizza I had today was good.
Die leaves die.
Cooked_Auto is it going to be squad based ?
Most likely since you never run mechs solo.
They more often than not work in units of 2 or 3 if not more.
I think I just watched the s1 finale.
It seemed pretty finale.
We are working to bring Too Many Portals to you ASAP I find this entirely too amusing.
SunTiger I just saw amaz intentionally fireball his face and it was a good play.
It started pissing it down when I was within half a kilometer of my front door -_-.
Managed to avoid the sudden monsoon that rolled in earlier.
My brother has bought DD5.
I could not be more disappointed.
Could be worse. Could be GURPS.
SunTiger his arena opponent was topdecking he had 25 hp a molten giant and a fireball.
Or an actually bad RPG p.
Fireballed himself moltened the next turn won with it.
Fair enough i suppose.
Warmachine our trolls wear quilts and play bagpipes.
Also one unit is a caber thrower. Except that they throw stone pillars instead.
Mair if you've seen Garnet's themesong and then another episode I think you've finished S1.
Where exactly the season ends is a bit confusing because they did a Stevenbomb comprising the end of S1 and start of S2.
Welp guess we'll be seeing an expansion announcement next thursday. I love how Gamescome is suddenly E3 2 Electric Boogaloo.
Oh that's still tonight's date.
Noelor personally i think the steven does/does not explain to connie episode is the s2 start.
SunTiger yes I think that's the official first episode.
Well yeah but sequels are always subtitles Electric Bogaloo I.
And it makes sense because of the flashbacks.
But also the finale and that opener still work when you go directly from one to another.
I really hate flashbacks to stuff from 3 episodes ago.
Especially in a 10 minute format.
And it's the previous episode.
But also only visual flashbacks during a song?
But i want NEW content.
Anyway I think it's forgiveable in a series opener.
Assuming they didn't know ahead of time how they were going to be scheduled which I can entirely believe.
MairBear Garnet is my otp.
Well it would be Opal otherwise.
Incidentally I checked ana's status was set to Away before saying any of this.
Tiny cloud whale + lion is otp.
Oh it's now sunny.
I can't even imagine what a fantasy analogue Finland would look like.
For some reason I can't help but to imagine him belting out some amazing opera lines.
Cooked_Auto> I can't even imagine what a fantasy analogue Finland would look like. <- I thought we'd agreed it looked like Way of the Samurai 4?
HuniePop Since you recently played Long Live The Queen because anime?
Thats just bad advice steam.
At one point later the reply to that was I said Fantasy.
You recently played a game with a cute princess.
Would you like a game about FUCKING WOMEN.
Technically it's about seeing them increasingly naked under really thin pretenses.
Oh I should update Ember's macros while I remember.
So its VN but with a lot more game to it.
Everyone should ensure their characters are actually fully up to date etc.
Have they come to maintain the harpsichord?
I'm still not happy with my ranger talent choice >.>.
Asking from ignorance What about Way of the Samurai 4 is fantasy finland?
That's the game Glenn's been playing.
Suddenly everything makes sense over the last few days.
I have considered checking that out as I believe I liked the first two.
That is him.
I need to find mp3s of that and uh.
Secondarily all the other s2 songs.
Has Lucina been visiting mario 3d world?
Claws of Vengeance Once per battle as a free action choose an ally. When attacking an enemy who damaged that ally during the last round crit range is expanded by 2. A mob of mooks counts as a single enemy.
SunTiger they are at an LGBTQ meet-and-greet for college students confused by/about sexuality both thinks the other is straight.
Look at the sex weirdo in a weirdo hat and laugh everybody.
That dinosaur chick sounds cool.
Oh-ho man unhelpful tech advice on fb grps are the best.
Some guy thought it wise to run two anti-malware programs at once inc Norton and is now having issues.
Immediate advice run linux.
200156 You were denied Enter privileges in Check your privileges. I was not ready.
Still the best internet meme.
I don't even know.
Like unless it's the actual second coming of christ.
They're going to be torn to pieces.
I doubt its that.
I did hear this might have been the last patc of WoD.
And they've been promising a faster expansion cycle since er.
...that's a freudian typo.
But not announcing it at Blizzcon means they want it real soon.
Depends if the announce/test/release cycle takes the usual amount of time.
Maybe they'll do it where it's an hour of meaningless pre-show and we get a 10 sec spot that's just a name-reveal.
Where the name is terribly vague and can't be extrapolated.
Blizzcon comes and they show footage and explain the name.
Where the name is terribly vague and can't be extrapolated <- but. blizard.
They will just tell us the name and then take an additional year to the cycle.
BwaS that would be possible if it wasn't for this tweet.
So I bought Way of the Samurai which was discounted... and it gave me a free game about firefighting woth £8? O.o.
That NPC naming.
Had guitar lesson with the instructor and a dude from my clas sin my house last night.
Had so much anxiety my fingers had no blood.
Which made playing hard.
Go ahead and wear cute dresses.
And very silly boots.
I'm waiting to meet the gothic lolito weightlifting girl of my dreams.
I'm thinking thats a very unlikely overlap of interests.
That was the joke!
Then again there is Ladybeard vOv.
....apparently the easiest way to get the highest ranking in this game is to do absolutely nothing but the final mission.
Because in dnd building a house actually takes YEARS OF LABOR.
Its crafting system is so bad.
Oh come the fuck on Facebook.
Friend of a friend posted transphobic assholery it ends up in my feed because the linking friend made a comment telling op they're dumb.
And obviously I need to see all my friends' *comments*.
Wouldn't want to miss a athing.
Minister yeah I just disabled all notifications from facebook on my phone because of this 'your friend did a thing' crap.
Well I dont think there is anything but to do at this point other than restart the game.
I've so far become a mass murderer angered the smith attacked the constabulary and I am running out of good weapons to use.
Mostly because I angered the smith.
Maybe don't do that then.
I wasn't planning to but I accidentally clicked on wrong option while in store.
And refused to pay.
Which angered the smith.
Wtf game are you playing?
Oh hey tonight is mage?
I should put that in my calendar so I stop almost forgetting.
Way of the samurai 4.
And I disabled fb notifications basically at the point of installation I was just perusing my wall =<.
Buildings do not move <- hey this is at least an understandable assumption.
Such a good article _.
<- someone decided to turn HS into a physical card game.
I think considering the costs involved just ordering the work done in a printing place would have been better.
Oh this is pretty neat.
10 min TWWH out.
You can steer Goblin Doomdivers yourself D.
Those charging calvelry look a little silly when they just stop dead the moment they hit the enemy front.
No sense of force there.
SunTiger They do say they are working on that.
Yeah it just look so silly.
Now i'm hoping this following thing is just for visuals for the demo.
But many of th ereally big units.
Seem to be spending all their time doing slow instakills on single enemies.
Instaed of you know.
Massive swiping aoe attacks.
Probably because they are missing the Giant didnt seem to have that many different attack animations.
Noelor.
> Obtained Battle Panties Persona sure is Japanese.
Noelor its not quite peak japan.
Is this male or female protagonist ?
The male protagonist is a fucking enabeling asshole.
Not just acquiring them for Yukari.
Well that's a statement.
Most of the male Social Links involve someone doing creepy or self destructive things and the male protagonist does not help or stop the behaviour at all.
I am not sure what's going on in Junpei's social link.
Also lying is a great way to progress them.
He seems a little... creepery.
Or dare I say it putting himself in the friend-zone.
Gaaaasp you said that.
Noelor persna 3 is full of creepy people.
Persona 4 is much better.
But doesn't feature a robot and a dog.
Does feature a fox social link though.
Thats not good enough for a 2 drop.
Why would you even.
The card was so bad I couldn't even click on it to re-focus before hitting ctrl-w.
Just take it easy kid. You’ll be legal before ya know it. No need to rush. yeah okay.
I think at its core persona 3 was trying to send a message about if you wanted to develop deep relations with people you have to basically just be whatever they want you to be.
But the end result isn't.. good.
That... isn't a very good message either.
Unless I'm misunderstanding you.
Develop deep relationships with an arbitrary set of people not because you like them but because you need something from them.
You need superpowers.
If you're nice to people only because you want something from them you'll be a creepy person.
I can accept that as a message.
> NPC stuffed a Fried Bread into your pocket umm.
Persona 4 handles social links much better.
Its like they learned! v.
What is it with japan and bread!
Its just bread though.
...the elementary school girl is the Hanged Man.
I'm sure this won't be depressing!
I don't remember her link.
BUT hanged man isn't that bad of an arcana.
Hanged man is about surviving and transitioning from one to another thing.
Not about death or stuff like that.
I always think of it as relating to a hardship and overcoming it though.
So over here we have a water emergency museum.
Its better in dutch.
Though it's been ages since I remotely knew tarot things.
Its currently suffering flooding.
Noelor thinking about it she does overcome hardship.
Your country is the best at water.
But its not as horrible as you might think.
Its a very.. normal ? hardship.
But also it's a small child in a JRPG so.
Don't want to spoil ahead of time.
In case you hadn't seen.
ChaosSmurf i just saw.
ChaosSmurf did you see how well magic duels launched ?
SunTiger given what you just said about the social links in general I am now reading the monk Tower social link speeches as meta-commentary.
The monk is great.
Eg People always want somethin’ in a relationship. They only really love themselves.
He's just jaded and cynical as fuck.
Sort of a tragedy.
Still can't play it.
Just crashes on launch for me.
Have you checked the subreddit.
It's mostly bitching but they're providing some updates there.
Thats where i learned how it was a massive failure.
I just wanted to know if i could change a config option to even launh the game.
Then i learned aobut the server issues and the broken tutorials.
The one solution to some crashes i saw was for a certain group of windows 7 users that had not installed a specific patch.
SunTiger apparently I missed this one.
MairBear its an okay 3 drop.
But probably a good buff target.
Somebody actually played that blood knight guy who removes divine shields against me in constructed otday.
I am happy how this ending turned out also spoilers to one of the endings but who cares about the plot in this game.
GlennCuddlefish which one are you ?
Noelor I have pizza slowly burning but otherwise have no sign of anything that will cause delay.
This new argent watchman card seems ludicrously bad.
You have to pay 2 mana every turn to get a +1 toughness boost on an otherwise unplayable card.
That being a 2/3 for 2.
Think of the value if you coin it on turn 1 and then hero power turn 2!!!!!!!!!
I assume it was a 4/4.
It's a worse ancient watcher.
Its just not worth the mana.
With that downside it needs to do a lot more than do 2 damage.
If it was a 3/4 ... maybe?
I'm really hoping they give priest a good 2 drp.
Because priests just don't have one.
SunTiger enemy preparation portals turn 1.
Plays loatheb turn 2 o.
Your turn 2 play is heal your northshire cleric mate.
Assuming you dropped one and they didn't kill it and it has a way to loose health.
Otherwise my turn to play tends to be taunt and then heal enemy face.
I actually can't think what 2 drops I play.
Which isn't really a 2 drop.
Sometimes a good option but much prefered as part of another play.
Priest has a lot of good cards.
An very few just play this on curve now cards.
I have been playing Flamewaker mage recently.
It is not very fair.
Having fun with it then.
Noelor how soon are we starting?
I can wait if you need to get food or w/e though.
Will just go have a smoke 10ish minutes.
This isn't quite cute enough to outweigh how creepy certain bits of religion are.
Talking of cute gifs.
I think the soulgem used to make the amulet contained a puppy's soul?
British journalist Kitty Logan from Sky News asks militants to shoot at Ukrainian positions for 'action'. Essentially because of her a major shootout took place on a tense frontline w/ RPGs and mortars.
Still a great dark ambient track. also works as BGM for this situation.
The source is in Dutch is this true SunTiger?
Anathema they are advertised as being healthy and skinny. The focus is more on the lack of artificial stuff and sugar than on not being energy dense though.
Since obviously they are that.
Technically they say refined sugar.
Because ofcourse fucking honey in it.
Also no gluten or diary!
Assuming 6 bars this recipe gives per bar 233 cal 14g fat 23g carbs 5g protein not even good macros.
But they'd be deliciours.
Maybe if I added some protein powder get upto 10g protein per bar and they'd be quite good.
Evil genius in the making.
Oh god I can't stop laughing.
Oh god I can't stop laughing <- this is animal abuse.
Making your cat swole?
Yes cats are not supposed to be swole.
Not to mention that i doubt this is a good diet for a cat.
Pert and Morty.
The no 1 cause of Heresy.
Anathema serious question though. like you're putting quite a bit of weight on your spine.
Do squats compress that enough to temporarily reduce your height ?
Dunno maybe a few mm? I assume nothing noticible though.
You reduce in height by being upright anyways.
Gotta say stay classy hometown...
Classroom*Crisis' opening cinematic is a typographic mess on drugs and I love it for it.
Sweet only need to buy one paint for my Blud Revens plan.
None. Painting some Scions in Blood Ravens colours.
Otoh if I could get a spare SM body I could for shits and giggles paint a guy with a deamonhammer and one of the GK bolters as a Blood Raven.
But that is dependant on me getting ahold of one SM body.
I want to archive this line that I'm going to delete before publishing this news story.
We've not reviewed it but The Swindle is sitting with a Mostly Positive rating on Steam which at least means it isn't horrifyingly broken and doesn't contain any women.
What is the point you are trying to make?
I think you can work it out mate.
ChaosSmurf the weekly event is rep from heroics the weekly quest is do 4 mythic dungeons get a heroic hellfire item.
Thsoe do not match up.
So it's more than a quirky subreddit now huh.
That I won't be at my PC for this Blizzard GCom livestream.
Given they've now confirmed NEW EXCLUSIVE CONTENT for all the games except Diablo.
Spread across the 4 days.
I'm at home for the Wednesday WoW stuff at least.
Classroom*Crisis end cinematic sure is a bit disjointing given it's ClariS doing the vocals.
Ugh I want to like GATE because of the concept but oh god is the execution so baaad.
Has it not passed the three episode rule for you then.
The third one ended with a fight against a dragon which was cool even if the CGI for it was PS2 levels.
I'd love to say Maybe it gets better but with the MC being insufferable and his only real traits is being an otaku and kinda lazy it was almost too late by the first episode.
Also the goth loli adept of a death god didn't help either p.
I mean we could've gotten Generation Kill meets Fantasy but nope.
SunTiger 0rangesicle's character in Retail Magic is an owlbear =D.
Well no wonder I am dying so much when leveling this new style. I had gotten used to the old ones damage reduction. Not I just drop from a single combo against tougher opponents.
5 days and magic origins is still not a game i'm allowed to play.
They sure do want my free 2 pay ubkc.
Play PoE again maps are fun.
I got Inception'd today by Zana.
Hm Halo Wars 2. Interesting.
Hey hi-rez HOW ABOUT FIXING TRIBES INSTEAD.
Nobody plays Tribes you silly.
Its deader than the dodo.
GLenn I've found the game for you VivaJava The Coffe Game The Dice Game.
Yes that is the actual title.
RIP The ICs podcast _.
MoonWolf If you haven't seen them the Modern Magic thing for 5th ed is the best thing ever.
Oh yay Spider's back.
Cooked_Auto i have not seen that.
Can you link me.
Sadly only a draft that I don't think will be a while book.
9 pages yeah safe bet its not.
The robot octopus though is kickin rad.
This stuff is all sort of silly.
Trying to make dnd do modern day stuff is weird.
I honestly want to see an updated Urban Arcana book.
I KNOW RIGHT D.
Looking at that ds3 trailer.
They sure are using the hair/cloth physics from bloodborne.
Also you really need to read that vehicle summoning one because its amazing.
They suddenly decided to stick random clothy bits and hair on every boss.
Is this where P4 is set?
Because the LP commentary for this section feels very referential.
Cant remember but there is a P4 to P3 crossover.
Minister yes thats a p4 reference.
And yeah CA I have PQ.
Gonna finish this LP before I play it.
But do you have DANCING ALL NIGHT.
MoonWolf I do not.
Nor do I have the fighting game.
Truly woe is me.
Fightin game is actually pretty good.
It connects the p3 and p4 crews through plot.
You probalby don't care about the fighting though.
I'm not a huge fighter no.
Man I bet all these crossovers use make protags though =<.
I don't know if that's even optional in 4.
They don't because of reasons.
Protag is just not there at all.
I think its assumed it was a man.
But story stuff means they won't show up beyond the plot of p3p.
Explaining more is VERY SPOILERS.
Also I assumed I was listening to k-pop.
Turns out '92 Take That.
I was thrown off by the lyrics being the same ten words related many times.
Well they don't have nearly the moves of even the lowest tier of k-pop group.
And like this place's playlist defs did include kpop.
Your place has an eclectic playlist.
Reading the first post tutorial dungeon bg2 big world project update.
So many things are happening.
Os many npcs and mods and stuff are like HELLO.
And then syvistar ran into a ROMANTIC ENCOUNTER.
They're not very romantic.
I think we might have an update that is nothing but walking into the copper coronet and just getting people going Hello i am very important i have a quest and i need to join your party.
Related to the above Google is not very good at identifying actual kpop.
Music is very hard.
Music is like natural language BUT WORSE.
Ugh going away for 5 days was a horrible idea.
So much emails to many tweets so many rss feed items.
So many FORUM THREAD.
Oh cool back-to-back Kylie.
MoonWolf this is why going on a 2-week holiday at Easter ended up killing any semblance of productivity for almost as long afterward.
I undertand that pain.
Koro... Other syllables idk.
They just call him Koro-chan.
Aka as The Pretentious Tenderfoot.
They gave him a vest!
In arena has had a hoody.
Perfect! Thank you so much!
And 3 is like WHAAAT where is that from? That looks so cool.
Huh when I saw twitters from TB's wife earlier today showing them at a retro arcade it didn't quite click it was the retro arcade expo up here.
TB helpfully posting a vine from geek retreat appearing to confirm this.
Well its TB so i agressivly do not care.
Theres a manos hands of fate game?
MairBear say hello to mid game undertaker this time battlecry flavoured.
Manos hands of fate game.
Thats not what i wanted to paste at all.
Also this Master of Ceremonies.
Also a good card.
Looks like tihs expansions good cards are going to be the cards that don't use the expansion gimmick.
<- pz myers agrees with me about soylent guy.
5.6 million idiots more like haha.
Also I thought Tavern Brawl was tonight and now I'm sad.
Sorry tonight's the night Hearthstone isn't worth playing.
TOnight and last night are let's get some daily quests piled up days.
Yeah they exist so you always enter the brawl with three dailies.
That's all Monday and Tuesday are for.
They had this really weird movie about some guy who teamed up with demons to fight a giant robot in the thirties it was actually pretty good though. <- the plot of P1/P2/SMTx?
MoonWolf who do I like in DotA now?
Who do I want to support etc.
Support team sercret for winning REALLY HARD.
No game tomorrow cool.
Not sure what happened there but it looked like Secret messed them up.
Jesus christ there is some kind of giant moth here.
Like I think I should start doing nuclear bomb tests in order to summon godzilla to deal with it.
It's not kaun is it?
Pretty sure it isnt.
Me last night Yeah I'll have plenty of time in the morning to pack bike in go to the gym... let's get swole!
Me this morning Actually I'm zombie-tired and btw still wearing nail polish that needs removing fuck the gym.
Good morning zombie Noelor.
Noelor no-one at the gym would care about your nail polish all they care about is gainz.
As long as you don't break gym etiquette.
Check yo flask before you chug it!
!note MairBear I'd like to see you win a HS game later for my spectate daily.
!note ChaosSmurf <- gamescom hearthstone card spoilers.
!note MairBear <- gamescom hearthstone card spoilers.
I like this minion reveal faceoff mechanic.
Also the red headed totally not the brace character ripoff.
Is actually just called Brave Archer!
Last night in WHFRP bickering and brain surgery and I bought a whip since no-one wanted to sell swords or trained war dogs to a one-armed elf.
Also we got robbed by some mercenaries we hired.
Why are you one armed.
I was in a boat that got hit by a cannonball.
Wizard had fucken' magical 'the damage rating of missle attacks is 0' so he just took the d10 which armour and toughness dealt with.
Also comes with a chance to get horribly possesed die mutate explode etc.
Anyway I'm mad because it is all the Bretonian's fault for attacking an fortified tower just because the person running it once tried to make him drink wine from a shoe.
Yeah no thats totally a legit reason for a brettonian to do that.
And the junkie Halfling hired the mercenaries who robbed us.
Other than me LOSING MY RIGHT ARM when I'm a right-handed archer no-one suffered any major issues and they took the tower since the tower guys surrendered when a raging knight and a dwarf broke down their mega-reinfored door.
Look if you lost your left arm as a right-handed archer you'd still be shooting zero arrows.
We dumped their cannon in the river though before leaving.
MoonWolf true but I also have 2 pistols!
But atm I'm at -40% BS to use them from handedness and not actually having specialist weaponry gunpowder.
Once I buy a rapier and a main gauche I can become a duelist.
The only good part of warhammer fantasy is hearing how other people get fucked over by the system for trying to have fun.
And the system going NOPE NO FUN FOR YOU.
Your elf totally cannot shoot a gun because HANDEDNESS.
Duelists get both the ambidextrous talent and the gunpowder weaponry one.
You can't even USE your main gauche.
How does that count.
Actually technically because this system has handedness.
You can't use the rapier.
So instead you'll just be a one handed elf with a fancy daggetr.
No I'm gonna use a whip until I can gun.
Low chance to hit but I know how to use it and it can make enemies easier to hit.
Also I had to get a lobotomy.
The humidity is the wurst.
Anathema your a lobotomized one handed archer.
Is there a reason this character isn't retired yet ?
Being shot by a cannon and bleeding out in the muddy bank of the river made me a bit mad I thought that beetles crawled into his wound.
And under his skin.
But the surgeon got the beetles out of his head!
I'm not abandoning poor Albrecht he needs to get revenge.
Thats not a very elfy name.
Also I love the skull lace in this somewhat nws.
Things i did not expect reading the words skull lace.
Well he has been pretending to be a human for a long time the party only found out he was an elf when he got lobotomised.
I'll probably die next fight anyway I've not no fate points left.
<- seriously a HS card.
I mean nothing wrong with the card.
I'm just suprised its a thing.
I want him to live though the shit Albrecht has been through.
He killed a troll man. a troll.
And now he needs to retire.
Spend his days doing whatever retired elves do.
Teach kids to fletch arrows or something.
MoonWolf we're in the middle of the Border Princes though no-where to retire to.
Hey is that Steve Blum?
This gameplay keeps getting interupted for Thing You Need To Look at.
And thats terrible in a game all about running around.
Fashion has gone very hunger games.
I watched like 10 seconds.
The fashion in the hunger games movies was fucken' fantastic though.
At leat the combat is still mostly run up to guy knock guy over keep running.
God i just reminded myself of shadowdragon.
And his stupid arguments about guns and combat in mirrors edge.
Kinda surprised it took them this long to get the announcement out since I noticed that on tg and twitter on friday or saturday.
I have found myself using BCC a lot at work lately.
Why is that ?
It's either I'm copying my manager in to show her what I'm dealing with without giving the *people* I'm dealing with her name.
Or it's moving people from CC to BCC so they know I've answered something but they stop getting copied on subsequent emails in the chain.
Because so many emails turn into too-long chains.
Proper Khorne cake.
Good lord that art.
That is prime art.
The finest. somewhat nws.
...why is ButtStuff2016 a thing?
Because its change we can believe in.
Doh wrong one.
And suddenly twitter has gone deathly quiet. Weird.
Rose levels Critical.
President of the Yoshitaka Amano fan club. I can buy that.
Man if I chugged all these down this cleaning session would be hella mellow.
So far I've found 2 sleeping pills and one benzodiapezine on my desk.
Aw yis we are getting some freaky stuff after all. Nice.
GlennCuddlefish or you could not abuse medication.
Well I wasn't going to.
Because I actually need to get stuff done.
I am not even sure where I got the benzo from.
A friend of a friend of a friend?
You should bash it open.
It might have low level currency.
It spawns waves of spiders apparantly and drops a random poison-themed unique.
New Overwatch character seems awesome.
Probably understands the concept of love.
I need to go look at tihs now.
For the laser skates.
He totally understands the concept of love.
Minister you forgot dancing in spot on skates.
The comments on the youtube video for the trailer are also full of JSRF.
LÃºcio I think that's the name? is the first hero I've seen who I think I could main.
I do believe you are right in the name.
I like the face hunter guy.
Ancestral knowledge is literally the only shaman spell I've ever liked.
Injured Blademaster v 2.0 is da bae.
Though probably worse than thoughtsteal.
Gormok doesn't feel legendary at all.
Priest might have a good early to midgame deck thats all about healing minions.
Still can't believe they actually just called it Brave Archer.
Overload spells SHOULD be shit.
2 overload is a higher cost than 2 mana.
If that makes sense.
Since it denies you an on curve play next turn.
I dunno if it's more than 3 tho.
It's also more rewarding though.
Since it lets you go ahead of curve.
Some overload cards do.
See the new ancestral knowledge is 2 mana draw 2 cards overload 2.
Thats at the most favourable viewing 4 mana draw 2 cards.
Downright inferior to the mage version.
But its WORSE than the mage version.
Since its overload instead of 4 mana straight up.
I'd take it at 2 mana overload 1.
I really seems blizzard is deathly afraid of giving shamans actual draw options they might want to play.
It is not even close to 4 mana draw 2 P.
And 2 mana overload 2 is much better than 4 mana.
Only if you are playing at a point in the game where your mana per turn is above the top of your deck curve.
Otherwise its just play this to not play your 5 drop on 5 or your 6 drop on 6.
Okay gang finish this sentence.
Sweet jesus a new silent hill. Oh wait its a _____ game.
There is a Chief Shen quote.
So lets hope he's still around.
There is still a hologlobe.
Holy shit troldens new video has ben brode on it.
And wasn't Brode on Krip's show lately too?
Also have they actually announced this WoW xpac yet or what?
Not sure what that happens.
Oh yeah it totally is tomorrow.
For some reason I had Wednesday in my head for it.
Finally had some money left over.
Ordered a new graphics card for my pc.
Now it'll finally be up to par.
Well alittle out of date at tihs point.
Man I cant decide what kind of character to make next in way of the samurai.
Because what better animal to associate with construction?
Not an option I think.
Also just finished an unarmed run.
I was thinking of character appearance rather than style.
Nah CA linked a gif or a webm th'other day.
There was a character made of boxes.
Dont think I have boxes unlocked either.
I am just guessing possible skins now.
Fuck yeah mount blade.
GlennCuddlefish that ridiculous mask thing.
I saw a screenshot where 2/3 of your character is just a massive demon mask thing.
Lemme just filter through this cosplay thread then yes.
Yaaay SpiderGwen even if.
...I still hate the comic being called that.
MoonWolf is it Rag vs nef again?! DDDD.
Everything is a piloted thing now.
Currently getting wrecked by a silence priest.
XCOM 2 hype though.
I'm assuming it's up.
MairBear One of the event screens seems to imply a Shen of some sorts will be present.
...you get to see the defenders' tech projects?
MairBear ISIHAC must be on.
Because I just walked past my dad's study and heard a voice on the radio saying the word sporran followed by audience laughter.
It's been on recently.
Overwatch has shown up in my b.net client.
I didn't see it at the weekend.
Ok then 3 druid quests.
Thats great because druid is good for this brawl.
Every minion has the shredder power in addition to whatever.
Are Deathrattle cards still valid?
We are un the mumbles if you care for that.
Just putting together a deck.
...I seem to have reached 30 cards without any neutrals.
2-drops just turn into Wisps don't they.
I haven't made a deck other than for Blackrock in aaages.
So I dunno if that's actually just shite.
Ok Blackrock or the dumb 10-mana brawl.
Just give it a spin.
Graze have delivered to me a tub of Belgian Speculoos.
Which I thought was Dutch for some reason.
No science waifu no sale I.
What if the Shen is Shen's daughter?
And is science mechawaifu?
Well the hardest difficulty certainly ramps it up.
I am having trouble doing the first fight properly.
In my defense to do the first fight properly in true ending path you have to fight most of the named characters right at the start.
Maybe don't try for true ending on your first attempt of the higher difficulty?
This is my second attempt actually.
Its just that I skipped this entire fight on the first one and went straight to the tournament.
I don't even remembering opening chatzilla.
Look at it Glenny!
Is Glenny still struggling to win that baseball game?
Nah he's currently struggling with Finland Simulator 2015.
It's Glenny's wet dream.
WHY WOULD YOU POST THAT DOG IN HELL AGAIN.
LOOK AT HIS LITTLE BOOTIES.
I CANT SEE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE COVERED IN BEES.
I bet he walks funny in those booties.
I just looked at this squares link.
MoonWolf wasn't here the other night when I posted it.
I am not going to click on anything ever again.
Bees want to be your friends Glenny.
So far giving up all my mana and slitting my wrists to swing a giant hammer around my head hasn't killed me.
I'll stop being mean to bees.
Once they drop dead.
Thank you. My imagination can continue on happily.
May we all take a moment to remember.
That Glenny said my face was adorable.
Like yesterday or whenever.
He also said it was fluffy but we'll overlook that.
I think it was fuzzy.
You know the thing that NEVER HAPPENED.
Then we'll overlook it even harder.
Now that we all agree that was a thing that happened I can go sleep because I'm drunk on tired.
Anathema doesn't the map type determine monsters in part ?
I think it is weighted but still random for the end-game maps.
Noelor.
Great now the curtains are attacking me as well.
And the statues the interior decorator of this place really doesn't like people.
Lazy desginers love black.
What is this some kind of communist manifesto.
I'm sure I could find you that pdf actually.
Didn't know Konami was a PEGI rating.
!weather remember newcastle upon tyne.
Man these dota casters are getting demolished in their predictions day in day out.
Squatted 5*5 @ 85kg today \o/.
Some day I will 2 pl8.
Going into harakiri difficulty without custom style in this game.
GlennCuttlefish enjoy your reloads.
I am seriously considering just hopping back on the boat and leaving the town at this point.
It kind of annoys me how this style became unviable on harakiri since so many moves just oneshot you now.
And one of the best moves is one that makes you tank a hit most of the time.
Steal a good sword and leave ?
Only way I could get a better sword than my current one is by making it myself.
Magical Girl Science!
Pretty sure light doesn't work that way.
Its magical girls GlennCuttlefish ain't gotta explain shit.
Well then DONT TRY TO EXPLAIN IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
People who legit ask those sorts of questions are the worst.
Almost as bad as people who try to apply real world physics to dungeons dragons.
You clearly are a wurst.
Names wurst. Brad wurst.
The best part is the worst is already the word for sausage in dutch.
No need for this wurst buisness.
No but back to that thing it assumes that light works different in that universe.
One time a guy in an Exalted game I was in tried to argue that because Graceful Crane Stance let you balance on an arrow-point effectively weightlessly that someone could fire you from a bow which yeah is fine as a one-off stunt but not as a solution to every problem S.
The one FF solo guitar book I want isn't on amazon.
And the others are likie Â£60+.
Vba has no break function and I don't even.
Vba is secretly a BBC again?
Also on the topic of my not understanding vba.
Vba insists you close all loops including ifs.
Except for some reason this one part of my current project refuses to compile unless I remove the end of one if and leave it open.
Lots of languages have goto.
And I just don't.
Yeah no go-to is fair enough I'll have a fiddle.
Anathema pretty sure it only has a goto because it was in the CLI spec and why not.
MoonWolf I dunno what the CLI spec says about goto but IIRC c# goto only works within switch statements and lets you jump to another clause.
Goto works outside of switches just fine.
The only usecases outside of switches thats even talked about it exiting very deep nested loops.
And it'll have been in the CLI becuase visual basic.
Kinda wish typescript had type inference.
For parameters that is.
Speaking of cats also a current issue Ms Marvel spoiler.
WoW Illidin Again. WeÂ´re just going to keep this circle going.
New WoW expansion revealed.
Wait it's just called ?
I almost liked the more outlandish fakes like the Council of Glades and the Azshara one.
Looks like they're finally doing a thing with ashbringer again.
Nobody saw that one coming.
They are doing thaT?
Also can't believe they didn't go with Hate of Sargeras.
So I take we are not prepared.
Now i didn't see confirmation on the illidan thing.
But i'm pretty sure illidan is going to be a thing again.
Why is illidan back?
Weeell considering the homepage has Illidan smack dab in the middle.
Cooked_Auto lol he changed his shirt to have demonhunter swirly things.
Cooked_Auto NVM totally confirmed.
I dont even watch the stream.
Fuck it. Might as well harp on that old joke again. P.
Yet at any rate.
Are they all elves?
Pretty sure they'll be like DKs.
Or I assume as much.
Unless it goes the Eragon route with You are now an elf and thus can be a demon hunter!
Wanna take bets on how long it'll take until Sylvanas actually becomes a loot pinata?
Or at last becomes one I guess.
Male dunter technically less dressed than female.
Noelor only because weird social standards on breasts.
Every little helps and all that.
So this time instead of a garrison.
You get to lead ALL THE X OF THE WORLD.
Where x is your class.
They rely on magically augmented sight to detect enemies even those that hide behind obstacles. WoW secretly becoming a cover shooter?
All the mages in the world.
Except all the other mage PCs?
Who also leads all of the mages in the world.
Except the other PCs who lead all of the mages in the world.
And also probably except for Jaina.
Noelor like wow has ever acknowledged anything other pc's do.
I'd be disappointed if you can't style ALL OF THE ROGUES OF THE WORLD into the AssCreed Assassins P.
The paladin place looks a lot like a modern scarlet monestary final fight hall.
Except its between lights hope chappel.
Yeah between sounds a bit off.
I'd be okay if Rogues get to control SI7.
Or do AssCreed Assassins.
Blizzard re-re-repeat that dungeons will really be cool this time guys.
Also more yes we promise again trust us.
Cashing in the nostalgia. Again.
Why wouldn't we deliver on this.
Its not like we've had this dicussion EVERY EXPANSION.
This has to be the last expansion.
Final expansion will be beating up the titans.
CLearly Warcraft in Space.
Or Warcraft Dimensons. Which would be HotS but as an MMO!
L110 cap doesn't sound final enough.
Needs to be at least 150 for final.
So a couple of more expansions.
I'm suuuuure Metzen can find something to corrupt.
Also returned bottles from my room.
Anduin what is wrong with your hair.
Also that is a lot of bottles.
Daily quest for shaman victories? in this brawl?
Don't mind if I do~.
GlennCuttlefish I am sure you can find some useage out of this.
Jesus christ how adorable.
MairBear Hearthstone told me to keep playing Brawl with the best deck.
So I am doing so.
You'll doom us all! D.
Why is Freya carrying a distraught Eiko on her spear?
*Is not sure if that's what's actually happening or what*.
MairBear keeping eiko out of trouble.
I wasn't onboard with NE only Demon Hunters.
But a they can tank.
B the women look like Jezebel.
ChaosSmurf I'm not onboard with it.
Where my panda DHs c.
!note noelor <- the joke is in tags.
Pandas are too happy to be demon hunters.
Yeah you need a minimal level of angst.
They are sticking to the Night Elf only demon hungers?
I wanna play a muscle-lady.
They can tank but they didn't reveal how it works.
Doesn't look like they use a shield.
Also doesn't look lke they're using artifacts to give prot warriors duel shield.
Some things are just not meant to be ChaosSmurf.
Nws due to shirtless bob the builder.
Ember in latest poppy that glove horror looks like a cuttlefish. Also I had to restrain myself from making an it was me joke.
So watched a lot more Steven Universe last night.
The episode with Lapis is pretty dark aye.
I like how she punches things.
And she has the best voice.
I can not disagree.
These are the Knaresborough Castle ravens and this â€˜naughtyâ€™ raven is probably Izzie the only bird in the UK to have been given an ASBO a criminal conviction for anti-social behaviour.
The fluffiest chicken.
And another Bloodlines LP has finished. I'd say the curse is broken P.
I could go on /tg/ post what just happened and start a flame war.
So here I was returning from getting a cup of coffee. But oh no! I just scrubbed my desk clean what is a man to do.
Then I remembered I got one of....Those as a christmas present a couple of years back.
And then I put my coffee mug down on my neat little portal coaster.
WotS4 is a very serious game.
I just got attacked by the kunoichi harem.
Not sure if sudden headache/lightheadedness is illness or hunger.
I'd test the hunger hypothesis first.
I forgot to bring lunch today.
Once I get these buttons working.
If you meant the buttons with letters on them arrayed in front of you.
I did not mean my keyboard.
Yay time to find food.
Don't forget to stay hydrated.
Hydration is very important.
According to my Band I expended 4000 kcal yesterday.
Legion doesn't have a nice abbreviation.
Its short enough on its own i think.
Well fuck might not be able to do the spartan race.
MoonWolf it's like 1.5 syllables.
Takes about as much effort to say as cata.
To rhyme with cowl.
Kinda wonder what Council of GladOS was about now though.
The copyright and everything?
It's why nobody's now reporting the Compete story.
Because they're worried it's fake too and they'll get burned again.
Even though it takes 13 seconds to check.
Some thing they copywrote.
People speculate it's an official thing for running HS and SC2 tourneys.
It's like the 3rd post on MMOC if you wanna see the deets.
So like Challonge but integrated into bnet.
Nah that's sufficient info tbh.
You're good at acquiring and relaying facts you should consider a career in it.
I need one if i ever get a cat.
ChaosSmurf i'd love that.
MoonWolf yeah no shit.
If Hearthstone had an integrated system for getting to tournaments.
I would do it 100%.
But i'm afraid it'll just be their official league program for something.
Something better than ranked.
Though I spose I don't get to legend regularly so.
It's not like I've exhausted ranked.
Also it wouldn't fix Observer mode.
Oh facebook |.
My packs this week.
ChaosSmurf legend is only really interesting to get too once or if you want really feel like king of hearthstone mountain / get blizzcon points.
I'll probably get it once in my life.
Then stop caring forever.
Not worth the grind.
You get max amount of golden card for rank 5 anyway.
The point where it becomes tedious to go up in rank.
Yeah after 5 its just better amounts of dust.
I was assuming legendary would get you a golden legendary.
Doesn't look like it.
It'd be hella rich-get-richer tho.
Good point and that leads to another idea.
The people most at the top are the people who least need mor elegendaries or amounts of dust.
So stopping the big payoffs at 5 is probably for the best.
MoonWolf yeah a free epic every month is pretty useful if you're trying to push from 5 to legend.
Unless it's a hungry crab.
You take that hungry crab and you LIKE IT.
Minister well it's golden.
So it's.
Ã½eah making them golden makes them basically free card of tis colour if you don't want tihs one.
Need to find a solo version of this.
Anathema how do I change the password to this.
I might not be arsed to change it.
MoonWolf Hearthstone stuff soon.
And HotS stuff dunno which first.
I know thanks for the heads up anyway.
I think the HS stuff is going to be some show matches.
That would be dull.
Oh no not her again.
Man soe and frodan almost have matching hair.
Here's goes down and to the right.
His goes up and to the left.
They're a reflection of oneanother.
Now we just need to give soe partial blonding.
I broke my thing.
Oh no not your think.
Revert to last commit to unbreak it.
ChaosSmurf also murky cups.
Now that I've considered English is probably her 3rd-4th language.
She's a lot better than I give her credit for.
Nothing wrong with her english just has an accent.
MoonWolf `git diff --stat` >> 15 files changed 141 insertions+ 54 deletions-.
I haven't committed in a while >_>.
MoonWolf she stumbles a lot.
Yay I fixed it.
My new thing is much faster than the old one.
Oh god fuck the humitidy.
ChaosSmurf she has a weird thing going on where she finishes words in a very upper class british way but at the same time has some germanic sounds.
I miss you dustin.
Yeah her voice is just v. weird.
I assume she's German.
Has lived in France for a long time.
Its sort of hot >_>.
And spends a lot of time travelling to America.
There is a german girl in the London office like that.
London accent from a native german speaker is weird.
Damnit if this HOTS stuff lasts too long i'll miss the HS stuff because of dinner.
ChaosSmurf man dustin browder looks great these days.
Have you guys heard the russian woman who's making Battlefront.
Yeah he lost literally half his weight.
She said crush rebel scum on the EA stage a couple of days back and it was terrifying.
Everything gets better with eastern european accents.
I wonder how much longer Dustin will be at Blizzard.
Especially crushing rebel scum.
I think less than two years.
And then he disapears into the great Riot developer black hole ?
Bashiok ended up at NCSoft.
If he'd gone to Riot.
What he does for NCSoft ?
You'd get moderately annoyed.
Across all the stuff they publish.
So who is going to switch over to DPRK time on the 15th?
Ah i figured maybe he'd move into more of a managing role.
Instead of still just doing CM.
I think he's like.
Head head head CM.
Given he's with the publisher rather than dev.
Which could be basically anything.
At a guess he had the problem GC talked about.
Where moving up past various ceilings at Blizzard is impossible.
Basically once you're a team lead good luck for the next 10+ years.
Because upper management is too static ?
Suppose with ppl like Metzen Morhaime Chilton Afrasiabi there are a few staying put.
They were posting pics of one of their anniversary days earlier last month.
And there were about 30 people in the 10 year column.
Another dozen in the 15 column.
On the one hand i repect a company that works and just keeps that working formula going. you don't have to just keep promoting people just because they are doing well. you want them to keep doing well at what they are doing.
Cause all the guys who started work on WoW are now 15.
On the other hand.
And the shit loads of people they hired in teh aftermath of it getting millions of players are now getting to 10.
Yeah frustrating if you want to grow your career upwards.
And there's loads of similar companies now.
Huh so apparently Dalaran is back as the Neutral city in Legion and everything Jaina did there has been retconned.
I didn't know about the retcons.
And so is the dungeon inside it.
Dalaran is more or less lifted from Wrath of the Lich King and will be a neutral capital city for both factions. For game play purposes it will still also be in Northrend - it won't be 'moved' the way it was for Wrath. Some things will have changed.
Regarding the new Violet Hold and other Dalaran changes the devs noted that Dalaran has some ancient purposes that weren't fully understood and it is affected by being brought this close to the Tomb of Sargeras.
I dunno if retcons.
We didn't actually have a good plot for this so here have this bullshit one we just made up.
Turns out dalaran was secretly an ancient anti demon flying magic city and NOBODY EVEN KNEW.
Stuff that only happened in books and one cutscene have not had permanent effect.
Yeah not a retcon more progression that there'll be some archmage handover.
Our neutral city was not in fact turned into a city of racists.
ChaosSmurf lol that medicav.
That article had best be yes it's happening it'll replace SHIELD.
It's a retcon in that they obviously never planned this shit.
Also hey where's Spider?
I just take each one as individual.
There was plenty of demon-y mystery stuff in the violet hold we saw and I think the dungeon environment showed other opaque pods.
They need to sell me on this expansion though don't have the WoD hype yet.
Other than you cna play Jez?
I think they sold me at Ashbringer and Illidan.
Yeah that bit's good.
I hope they start at 100.
Double jump Jezebel dhunter.
Instead of making me do WoD.
They've confirmed free 100.
I thought they confirmed 90+.
Word from icy veins today is that DH is above 90.
It was just PS refusing to do that link it seems.
Oh no I mean.
Xpac will come with a 100 boost.
Even if dhunter isn't 100.
I haven't even used my wod 90 boost yet.
I will spend it on a dhunter then.
I still have my 90 yeah.
Probably wait for the next non-hero tanking class.
Which will be a few years.
Might just make a horde warrior.
Anyone pretending they aren't coming back.
Professions are getting a lot of new stuff. The professions team for Legion is the largest that Blizzard has ever had for WoW.
Its TWO PEOPLE NOW.
Wanted to optimise it on a 60+ so the profession boost but my existing 60+ are close enough it would waste.
Professions were so shit in WoD.
Yeah they were real bad.
MoonWolf Maybe they're even THREE!
Here is your generic items that everyone expected.
So the first guy can take a break occasionally.
They managed to make double gather even more boring.
Which is just impressive.
If they bring gathering back hard I won't be impressed got too secure with LW/engi.
Dustin may be the best dev on the mic.
He's really good at talking.
He's up there with GC anyway.
Now get that guy away.
I want me some Brode.
Is he actually there.
Have not seen him on video stuff yet.
OW tonight or tomorrow?
Think today is just hearth and heroes.
It's only about an hour.
ChaosSmurf well it is blizzard self selected questions.
So its not so much a question as a thing we wanted to say anyway.
Oh my god yes.
Old spice? what is this 2009?
Is the guy back.
Is the guy back <- yes.
Kripp sure has learned.
How to be in front of a camera.
Some blizzard pr people probably drilled him on how to no be like he is on twitch.
Is this emotionless guy.
Here instead of brode.
I guess it's anti-aggro.
And inspire is fairly anti-aggro.
Joust on a deck that has a lot of hihg many minion is like about a 60% chance for it to go off.
Any creature has to be good enough to be played without joust going off with the joust effect being a nice bonus.
So the MtG boardgame is kind of neat even if the production quality is a bit so and so.
Just a good card.
I'm not sur ei can take this blizzard.
They're learning! Maybe the kidnapped some people from WotC.
Its not exciting to me.
It might be okay though.
This interview with this girl.
Might be the worst interview ever put on camera.
Closely followed by that one.
MoonWolf there's a new card on the site too.
2/3 for 3 warrior if you have a dragon +1/+0 and charge.
ChaosSmurf Fist of Jaraxxus is pretty weird.
Charged Hammer is pretty okay your hero power sucks for tihs expansion have another one instead.
Alex's champion is pretty good.
Too bad it won't make dragon warrior playable.
<- its funny because in ducth a seal is a sea-dog.
What are the other dragon warrior cards.
They have no dragon class cards.
Maybe if they put it in paladin.
A dragon deck might work.
3 mana 2/3 is slightly overrate.
In fact yeah that card's p bad.
Diablo 3 just announced the end of season 3 august 23 start of season 4 august 28 so expect 2.3 to drop between those.
This patch is cool.
Will play for another 8 or so.
All about the inevitable expansion tho.
An all-new weapon type Glaives will be the only weapon type that Demon Hunters can use. ofc.
Is this all on icy-veins.
Noelor that to me confirms the thing i said yesterday.
Glaives have a unique animation set.
If they're adding animation sets.
That'll only be set up for the races that can be dh's.
But not double shield.
Starting level between 95-100 is currently being debated.
And then you'll level to 100 in the start zone.
And go start the new content.
Having to go through TBC as a DK is like.
95% the reason I don't have one.
You could 90 your DK.
In fact DK is one of the better things to 90.
Because DK is an easy 60.
So you can give it profs and they'll get boosted with it.
In Legion Survival Hunters will be a melee spec that utilizes a pet. well.
Also marksman lone wolf spec.
Marksmanship Hunters will fight at range with NO PET. huh.
I guess a lot of MMs probs took LW anyway though.
Also we ripped being a pseudo demonhunter out of warlock.
No word on rogues/mages spec diversity =/.
Yeah for MM and SV LW is simmed to be higher dps.
As BM the same slot is 'adaptation' which does heavy pet scaling and comes out on top of the 3 as well.
Aesthetically it's not for me though and it actually locks out a non-zero amount of other options on the other tiers.
I need to look at warrior things.
1831 is this all on icy-veins.
1832 and yes.
Nothing about warriors though.
Real short interview I guess.
Will be 5 minutes.
I mean it's pretty obviously leather.
That's leather chest armour.
A lot of shit for artifact weapons.
It's better than the talent thing.
But it's that same kind of less is more deal.
That WoW players just do not undersatnd.
Cursed vision of sargeras leather bandana drop off illidan in black temple that's all it is.
At the end of the Legion cinematic.
To terenas x medivh?
ChaosSmurf artifact weapons are great from their perspective.
They have to make 36 weapons for the whole expansion.
No more having to make waepon art for every boss!
I'm liking the two vrykul dungeons might like something less claustrophobic than grimrail turned out for the ship one.
Each dungeon at least will need new aesthetics.
If you liked Grimrail.
Tbh it'd be fun with a better camera + less hell packs.
36 base weapons w/ about 4 colour themes then about 5 advancement paths of derived models and colour themes on that.
BwaS I think there'll be more than 4 themes just how many they showed.
There's gonna need ot be A LOT of cosmetic stuff.
To stop people crying about it 24/7.
They didn't say it outright but heavily implied Mythic 5 mans will be in from the start.
So pretty happy about that.
I wonder if they're locked from transmog.
You can turn them into other things.
You can't turn things into them.
Hmm transmog assbanger into a 2h axe.
Really hope my vision of warrior matches Blizzard's.
ChaosSmurf thats great... untill next exapnsion.
Where my awesome legendary weapon is out classed and i'll never see its skin again.
Urgh I really cba cooking tonight.
Hmm maybe a follow-up age of sigmar where the power of the old blades dissipating will justify the progression.
No stat squish.
Has anyone actually done a 1-90 boost.
I'm interested in what the intro mechanics are.
You just start off with the invasion and the like on rails bit of it acts as a basic class tutorial.
Where they give you spells in 2's and 3's.
Sc2 medic coming to heroes as support class.
ChaosSmurf they give you your spells in batches per level.
And each like parcel of quests in the Tanaan intro more-or-less lines up with a level.
I did my paladin that way.
Noelor forgot you wanted this one.
I mean that's not the title I'd have given that.
I should really make a SU subfolder at this point.
Maybe it wasn't the right one but it was still the Best one.
I mean mainly because those are like the 2nd and 3rd coolest gems in terms of temperature themes.
But you don't watch it so w/e.
Me Mum what curry do you want?
Mum Oh that usual thing we get with the chicken. I'll be back at 8. Bye!
Well it was obviously the Best one because it makes you wonder what it'll be P.
I almost never order curry when my mum's also eating because dad does so this'll be an adventure.
I'd be amazed if it was anything different from ordering a pizza p.
Noelor ask dad ?
Well he's not here.
Or he'd be ordering.
Ah well I think I picked the right one from the menu in the kitchen drawer.
That'd be an odd call Daaaaad how do I order curry?
Onion's mum's name is a type of onion.
So many fucken bows.
Do you even shoot bows.
Anathema its not really superior if it has 1 slot is it.
But what if its a really good slot?
MoonWolf The best dragon has made an appearance in Drakengard 3 O.
These are so great and this is the oldest page so not even that many really.
Noelor I do not.
That sight has spoilers.
In case that isn't obvious.
Shut up I was typing fast in case anathema was somehow on it.
He's playing road of the castout.
Oh god finally found the energy feedback that caused the tinitus like noise that's been driving me insane all day.
What was it ?
The printer power converter.
Thought it was my second monitor but that was fine just a low hum while on.
Possibly what was annoying the dog as well come to think about it.
Finally finished wind waker.
Also tried to start trauma..team 2? but wii censor failed to work <.
Also got a zelda art book as a belated birthday present.
Thanks. celebrating my un-birthday with talisker.
I shall one day go eastwards and bring drinks with me in return for a couch for sleeping upon.
I'll see what I can do. Just give me enough warning and I might actually be able to clear the house.
Hm Rising Moon Setting Sun by Sirens Sailors is not bad.
Is it a song?
Will youtube something from it once I finish boogaloing in a double action manner.
Cant interrupt my going fast soundtrack now.
Although it might be a bit too much Killswitch Engage-y for some.
Lesse if it's on spitofy.
Cooked_Auto it's good but a bit too heavy for my mood at the moment but saved for later 3.
MairBear you know things.
I think blue ones.
I thought turalyon was a high elf?
Wait no no. Alleria was a high elf.
Possibly turalyon too v.
Turalyon was the alliance commander who went through the dark portal in wc2.
Had a thing for high elf alleria w/ them sylvanas' sister.
And they just weren't around in WoW for whatever reason.
When portal gets shut down they go missing like all others like khadgar were.
Just they didn't get added in tbc.
Their half-elf paladin son is in though.
Turalyon is also the realm I played on in uh...
Ember it's the realm we were on in Panda.
Smurf any guesses on if there are going to be fighting stick sales soon?
I get it confused with Thunderhorn.
Which I guess is Dob's realm?
Think it's still your brother's and desk's.
GlennCuttlefish no idea mate I caved and bought a second hand shit one off ebay and immediately regretted it when it arrived.
Because it's shit and one of the buttons is dodgy.
Just replace the button then.
And at the moment all I'm playing is Rising Thunder which is keyboad anyway.
Yeah I'll look into it.
How's rising thunder working for you ?
I think it's fucking fantastic.
I genuinly did not see that coming.
I don't know how deep it is.
But everything about it is v. good.
It will be as successful as Skullgirls.
It could be as successful as League.
Those don't bother you ?
Nope they're just there so they never have to worry about infinites.
They literally never come up.
>as successful as skullgirls.
Because hitting with normals reduces them.
Note I only play one character.
You dont have much faith in this do you.
Skullgirls has a community is respected gets tournaments at EVO.
ChaosSmurf regarding your very recent Icy Veins tweet I think Icy Veins used to have good crit.
GlennCuttlefish hey he indicated a range between skullgirls and LoL.
Wait there was a SG tournament at evo?
Ember I've never actually read their crit I'm basically making an assumption.
Thats basically predicting the weather by saying its going be anywhere between -5 and 30.
GlennCuttlefish not on main stage.
They changed it to multistrike in WoD though.
Goddamnit I must look it up.
I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO SET UP.
MoonWolf what I mean is.
It's a v. good game.
With a smart team behidn it.
So its top end is League.
And I think it's good enough that its bottom end is skullgirls.
I don't think the fight games market is big enough that league levels are ever going to be reached.
Not even with a really really nice game.
It's also not a team game.
So I agree with you.
But I think it could do very well for itself.
And the one button specials and supers just mean it's actually fun to play.
Trying to play 3rd strike after it was.
And has entry level appeal.
I think it has cool characters too.
But have heard others say they look generic.
But I've never understood criticism like that.
Stuff like that can be very personal.
Its easy if its bad enough for everyone to agree its bad.
But even for what many people think is good.
Some just don't dig it.
I always find it v. difficult to criticise art styles.
Cause I'm just like.
Well that's the style they went for.
TIL Basking rootwalla was a card Wizards thought was okay.
MoonWolf Madness 0 mm-hmm.
That deck was a lot of fun.
And the one button specials and supers just mean it's actually fun to play <- scrub. Scruuuub. SCRUUUUUUUUUUUUB.
P mad they're printing more quartermaster style cards.
When they card is stunningly broken and needs a nerf.
MairBear MoonWolf Imagine if Jasper sneezed so hard her gem came out of her face and she had to regenerate.
Thats not how that works!
It'll be graet if they print some good warrior dragons.
Fist of Jarraxus seems cool.
Its a neat idea.
I wouldn't put it in a deck.
Soulfire synergy etc but yeah.
I apreciate the idea of cards that are good if you have to throw them out of your hand.
And warlock has a bunch of those effects.
But at the same time.
Wouldn't i rather put in a card thats potentially useful if i don't get forced to discard it.
Can't wait for the Trolden of a mill rogue losing to fist of jarraxus though.
Canvas wall hangs of the freaking box covers.
So this wasn't an issue until now because I didn't have any headphones is there an equalizer for windows 8?
This bass is pitiful and if it was dropped no one would care.
Meanwhile you talk to someone a french chick with a chainsaw is massacring werewolves.
Cooked_Auto any tips for finding dungeon groups or for that matter if it's even worth the hassle?
Only done one Dungeon so far.
And I guess its sorta worth it for the gear but otherwise you can just buy it of the AH.
Fair enough. It's the only thing for my QL level that I had remaining in Kingsmouth.
But suddenly all the quests in savage coast are Very Hard instead of hard... c.
Hm how many points have you put into talismans?
That's one of the ones you should sink SP into first.
I have a bunch banked but I was holding onto them until I got an item that I couldn't equipt.
You keep sinking points into them regardless.
That and upgrade your primary weapons.
QL 2 on them xD.
Remember if you have 40SP you cant actually gain more.
I was at 35 so yeah good call. I'd have forgotten otherwise.
So up your primary weapons and talismans.
35SP will only become relevant when you unlock Aux weapons.
Also you need help just say so.
Done done. I also have 0 confidence that I have a viable tanking/healing ability set up. So I'm assuming I just advertise as DPS rather than fuck up a dungeon run v.
If you want build ideas look on TSWdb.
I've been using a Chaos/Shotgun build that has lasted me from pretty much thart of Solomon Islands up to Transylvania.
What's character name for the sake of friendslistings?
I just don't dig the 'Nati outfits in their faction decks c.
Though I do have an alt of each just for the sake of having one each.
Also for sake of reference while I only delve onto it when with a friend or two my illumnati is Aegirine.
Dragon was here. Illuminati know nothing and the templars are impotent. PS Your being mad was foreseen and questioned.
I should reinstall TSW. now if only I had the space.
Says the faction whose only selling point is a magic blowjob.
Grmbl I have had voltaire's bomb new jersey stuck in my head for 2 days now.
Ive had Dio playing for most of the evening now.
I've been playing around with an equalizer and realised how stupidly deep my voice is when I don't speak to others.
I've always been told to speak up and make myself clear when I'm talking to others because they can't hear me because my voice so I don't think about it.
Don't think anyone has really heard my real resting voice.
Stupid auction house wanting money If I spend my money how do I buy all the clothes o.
< bribe them with waffles.
MairBear then I suggest you avoid vising the London underground market p.
Nah London is camden for clothes and borough for foods.
He meant in TSW .p.
< make the game reflect the real world!
Cooked_Auto but that's all the best stuff o.
Also is tacos just cos of achievement? V.
Nah best healing food afaik.
Also you do know they change their inventory every day right? p.
I assume it's on a slow rotation?
So failing to buy something now just means wait a few weeks.
And their rotation is pretty short like 3 or 4 different ones.
Ah yeah that's what I was meaning to ask. How long before I see repeats.
Is there clothings on the auctions >.>'.
Possibly but they're ridiculously expensive.
Oh yeah final thought salvage or vendor on soulbound lowbie loot?
Your choice if you need the pax.
Dont forget that every stack of 5 items upgrades to a new level.
Ah good good. Just didn't want to salvage too much only to find out that crafting is actually garbage and pointless.
Ive never really used it.
Also when you can get upgraded sprint.
Right that's why I came to london.
I nearly forgot entirely. >.<.
Upgrading bank and inventory is second to upgrading sprint.
Are the upgrades sequential or is it actually more efficient to try and skip if possible?
Cant remember but they will get really expensive fast.
I still need a couple of hundred thousand pax for the last one I can buy without using the item store.
Ah yes the higher tier one is greyed out till I buy the lowest tier one. Alas.
No they're dependant on your faction rank.
I was rank-eligible for the blue one but it was greyed I bought the green one and the blue lit up afterward.
While voltaire is good background music for cleaning I think I need something else.
Since i've been listening voltaire only for the last few days.
MoonWolf I DID IT I GOT A UNIQUE FROM A CHANCE ORB.
One I already have _.
Wasted that perfectly good once in a lifetime event.
I should dust more often here.
I just swiped every surface yesterday and there is already a noticable covering of dust on my PS3.
Being black will do that to devices.
Then again PS3 is stupid glossy so any dust shows up instantly.
Bah I cant think of music that is fairly energetic and is easy to hum/sing along to.
Also take this TM117! TM117 contains Swallow! This is a powerful move that lets you eat the precious little CHILDREN CHILDREN CHILDREN HEHEHEHEHEHE.
People have been thrown out. There is still some cake.
Yeah I had far too much of that as well as mom baked some sticky chocolate cake for the people dad had over to help him sort Lego.
And 2 types of smÃ¶rgÃ¥stÃ¥rta.
Well time to sit down and enjoy my cake. and coffee. Without milk because we used a litre of it as coffee milk.
Go away 70% humidity.
Or at least just start raining.
Rained last night here pretty good.
Oh dear. I might actually have reached my limit in coffee for once.
Wait what is this.
Bonus missions for GZ I assume.
That raiden has a gun #notmyraiden.
So today in fantasy finland I am crying and kicking a corpse in the graveyard while 5 constables are trying to murder a guy with a basket on his head in the background.
I didnt even know the guy I am kickin.
Every 2 seconds a gong chimes.
Finland is a weird place.
Only the cold parts.
So... all of them ?
Finished S1 of steven universe.
The saddest unisex space rock romance show on television.
SunTiger what's the 411 on Overwatch/SC2 from today.
Was fixing someones pc.
Why is there not an MMO Champion for OW yet.
Because it doesn't even have a closed beta.
There's a wowhead for overwatch if that helps.
Looks like there was nothing of note at the stream.
And I don't give a fuck about SC2 stuff enough to find out.
ChaosSmurf when ramp druid isn't fast enough play rocket warlock 10 mana on turn 5.
This series truly has the worst imouto.
Anyone awake with an ear.
Half an ear maybe.
Mind listening to something and tell me if it sounds like a dog panthing.
Oh now that I cant do right now.
I#m messing around with some audio software and need someone else to have a listen.
Jesus christ how adorable.
Wait does that dog.
So I was watching this anime thing just a comfy slice of life my goggles were turned off.
And then out of nowhere one character has a room full of dolls of another character.
MairBear ramp is for suckers real people use rockets.
I want to see the people.
Who play that card with deathwing.
I think its genuinly a good card if you first establish a board that can draw cards for you.
Turn 1 coinnervate it out turn 2 draw and play DW.
Regardless of how good it is.
There will be some really sweet highlights.
Which btw i love that this is now part of evaluating a hearthstone card is it good in constructed is it good in arena will it produce sweet highlights.
Is it though. or is that just us?
I don't think its just us.
I know reynad does that.
I take that to mean that we acn be as pro as he.
But will dog shaped robot buddy and dog shaped dog buddy be able to hang out together.
Unsure if they actually meant Geldrop or Geldorp.
We have both.
Oyh man they really went all in on this they have a ton of elven names there too.
According to the study â€œEscaping from Childrenâ€™s Abuse of Social Robotsâ€.
In a second paper â€œWhy Do Children Abuse Robots?â€.
CHildren will be the cataclyst for the robot uprising.
For the full thing.
Okay I give up trying to unlock these two skills in WoTS4.
The game just doesnt spawn enough enemies to do it.
This collection of 90's tracks are pretty good. So far found a bunch of them I need to save.
In the city of Bandar Mahshahr population of about 110000 as of 2010 the air felt like a searing 165 degrees 74 Celsius today factoring in the humidity.
That gravity falls game looks pretty dope.
MoonWolf Brawl popped an Annoy-o-Tron out of my Shieldmasta.
Noelor good job brawl.
Wtf does that even mean.
I am yet to spend a single euro on this stupid game but if the new priest hero is a smug girl with really smug emotes ill buy that instantly. hearthstoneplayer.rtf.
There is some live music thing going on nearby.
The cricketfield beyond the trees maybe.
It was very distracting.
Vin Disel and Elijah Wood. Huh.
I found a thing.
Thats certainly a thing.
Why would anyone ever equip that ?
Because you hate things.
Its a map you don't equip it.
Personally i wouldn't go there.
You'd be fine with a couple of topaz flasks.
I would hate to meet a shared boon pack there.
Wow it looks even dumber than I imagined it.
What are you talking about that is the secretest bunker ever.
Nobody could ever spot it!
Well considering how moronic people are in Cyberpunk Chicago of 2013-ish I'm not surprised.
Omg the next SU episode is september S.
Anathema all caught up? o.
<- anti fire shotgun thing.
With the exception of OTS MoonWolf confirm/deny.
I don't even know what thats trying to convey.
How things start serious but end up silly.
Okay next sword I make will be huge. its just too risky to play this with a shorter blade.
Okay another thing I really dislike with this game The UI is horrible at times.
Like I am trying to buy everything from the casino gambling is not an option since the doubling system does not favor you at all.
One item costs about 500 tokens there are some 30-60 items if I had to guess.
You can buy tokens in maximum stacks of 100.
Each purchase is 4 buttons.
You know what fuck it.
Lets see if I can figure out how this game stores the amount of inventory items.
Found it faster than expected. Now I have 15000 chips.
You horrible horrible cheater.
Verily you are a wurst.
Which wasn't enough btw.
I dont mind admitting I cheat like a mofo in single player games.
If there is bullshit like this.
Besides messing around with cheat engine is fun at times.
I should not want that so bad.
Thats not how water genasi work.
Oh boy plague of gripes I wonder what kind creepy sex thing is hidden behind this link.
Have some cute and fluffy dogs then.
Anathema a long timeline of people going insane and murdering everyone ?
I just want to highlight this to people who weren't there for the glorious two weeks between 1.0.0 and 1.0.0f. There was no cooldown on CwDT. There was no level restriction on CwDT. Vaal Pact was still furiously OP it was as it is now but with old leech values. You could walk into a room with three fully supported CwDT Discharges and both Voll's items and watch everything blow itself up on you in half a second.
MoonWolf builds not lore.
Bit of a misleading title then.
OP abomination specs <---.
The low life attack build variants with the old Crown of Eyes where the DPS display had to switch to scientific display mode.
I'm impressed it could do that.
MoonWolf floating point math bug = 1 shotting bosses.
Really bosses don't have the hp to survive sicfitif notation levels of damage per second.
I love hearing about the technical details of bugs.
Wish we got an explanation of that Fixed a bug where fire damage converted to chaos only affected maximum fire damage not minimum fire damage for fire damage that was converted from cold damage that had been converted from physical damage. This is the description in the programmer's actual commit message. It deserved to be left unsimplified! bug.
It seems pretty self explenatory!
Anathema well you'd assume that they just have a generic x to y conver.
But maybe they don't.
Maybe its specific on every item/skill.
And they fucked something up that propogated weirdly up the chain.
Wanna build around sometime.
Anathema seems a bit limited.
Better not find a fire immune anything.
There are no damage immune enemies in PoE.
Because immunities are un-fun.
Also remember there is Avatar of Fire passive capstone!
Its a shame you hate fun or we could run maps.
I need to find someone to run that unique map I found with.
Mao Kun was created by supporter magiceffect. He wanted Tricornes.
Fixed a bug where occasionally Fairgraves Neverdying never dies.
Listen up ye mangy landlubbers! Some rules are so important that we've written them in blood! Heed them well and they will not just improve your game but also your life! The first and most important rule Freebooter's Fate is a game it is supposed to be fun entertaining and always fair. Arrr! Teehee ^^.
Rad as balls.
Also that is a p cute telling of rule 0 =P.
Hence why it was also amusing.
The weather is very British today.
Here its just warm.
Huh had no idea Queensryche had a billboard track in 91.
Nevermind ballad. That's why.
Oh we had that yesterday so I guess its your turn now 8D.
Humid barely any wind.
Not doing anything yet i'm sticky all over.
Yeah or you get sweaty from just eating dinner.
So after about 50 enemies into this fight I see a tiny prompt at the bottom of the screen.
Thats what you get for being a capatilist.
Bah. lost concentration and died.
Ah well. needed a break anyway.
Sunny into rainy into windy into diagonal rain with sun overhead.
This morning I learned the etymology of prestidigitation.
Presti- fast -digit- fingers -ation doing.
And as is basically the purpose of etymology helps me remember the spelling!
Doesn't quite do that for me.
Well finally catching up on lewd terrorists the anime again jesus christ this series.
So I'm going through 15 gigs of pop music from 1990s to 2014 and reached 98 and then Everybody by Backstreet Boys comes on and all I can see in my head is.
Ooh the burn.
Well Dr McNinja certainly took a weird turn.
%Â¤# 60% there and made one mistake.
The state of the gentlemen's toilets at my office is an escalating war between the cleaners and men determined to be disgusting.
There is a short rhyme above every toilet asking that the users please not leave urine on the seats.
Which ofcourse leads some people to maximeze urine in seats.
And I swear that has resulted in it happening more often.
From what I have understood there is no such thing as a sanitary public bathroom.
And then just now someone left his cubicle after me put his hands under a tap for about a second then left without drying them.
All while I was still applying soap.
GlennCuttlefish it's an office the standard's a bit higher.
Oh I've done that when there are no paper towels or I don't want to use the blower. Just dry them on my jeans p.
Not home standards but still.
CA we have one of those airblade super air dryers it wasn't occupied.
And I'm pretty sure he didn't use any of his clothing.
I don't know what an airblade super dryer is but i want one.
Also the no soap or scrubbing we're now just into Noelor has mild ocd territory though.
I'll explain when I get home.
Or he could just google it.
I think it's a Dyson trademark.
Its just a really efficient hand dryer.
MoonWolf Oh. Here we go again.
Where ar we going ?
At least its not a naked statue woman ?
I really really need to figure out whats wrong with my copy of that game.
It gets downright EVIL later.
Those are camera angles made by someone who hates you.
If you cannot guess by the camera going insane toward the latter half you're meant to do this boss by audio cues. Woe be to the nerd that has no rhythm or grace. I finally beat this fucker entirely by just closing my eyes smoking a cigarette and listening to the notes. Took about two hours my first time. Give or take. I stopped smoking years ago. Goddammit game!
Still my favorite track from those games.
Yeah that's the special track.
Although the taiko drums do sorta ruin it.
MoonWolf is every 2-class combo theoretically possible for the Dominance/3-win dailies?
Or only pairs with vague thematic links?
The friend is deaf.
So I have an acquaintance. Said acquaintance knows a friend. The friend wanted to play a cool action game so he got recommended Nier. He really loved it! Everything about it. So when he heard about Drakengard 3 being by the Nier guy he went and picked it up went through the whole game. Up to here.
Look up at the quote I posted. It's from the Drakengard 3 LP.
The game ends on a a sound rythm based boss. the last thing you need to do is clear a queue on a completly black screen no visual aid at all.
1822 although the taiko drums do sorta ruin it <- Taiko drums ruin nothing get out.
For that song they're kinda unfitting >_>.
Buddy I have taiko'd my way through Cruel Angel's Thesis.
Don't talk to me about unfitting.
I... am gonna need a youtube link for that that sounds amazing.
Buddy I have taiko'd my way through Cruel Angel's Thesis <- true endurance.
I with Trump would just drop dead.
Oh wait no Trump.
Dob luckily nobody was filming Broelor and me at the arcade in Kagoshima nearly two years ago.
So you'll have to take my word for it.
That track sure escalates at the end huh?
Oh wait that's the middle.
Hmm moviebob bringing up something someone said in march 2014 to slander them... pot kettle black.
Unfortunately my examinations were not on these subjects. Therefore I do not think I did very well. Aigis =3.
At this point things are less lewd than previous episode.
Thats pretty lewd for an anime without lewdness.
I didnt say there wasn't lewdness.
This series is more lewd than some hentais.
Well that's kinda fucked up.
This seems a little excessive for pokemon.
Pokemon is fucked up.
Yveltal doesn't give a fuck about your cloaking.
It IS the darkness.
Also it'll turn you into stone ?
Xerneas probably fixes everyone at the end of the movie anyway.
Cooked_Auto Mikheal All I wanna do is not see you turn into a giant woman!
All I wanna be is someone who gets to see a giant woman?
I shouldnt be surprised at this point. this episodes end credits have a video of how to make a disposable onahole from potato starch.
Why is that in any anime at all.
Even if I didn't know how many more updates the LP has I know there is no way you're actually almost done Yukari.
Have better genre awareness.
Nothing has gone horribly horribly wrong yet.
That means this at best the second act.
That one guy is in a coma in the critical unit.
And half the team's personae have evolved which I guess is a thing?
Noelor that is in fact a thing.
But unless the world is about to end AGAIN.
Its basically smooth sailing for a SMT plot.
Oh god about that new handheld. So there’s a rumor going around that it’s got some kind of secret application that lets you summon demons. Ridiculous right? I mean how dumb would that be? <- SMTx? P2?
Something like that yes.
Like I know P4 is the TV so.
Summoning controlling demons through the power of technology goes back to Shin Megami Tensei 1.
Yeah but cellphones specifically in this case.
Calm your tits.webm nsfw.
She didnt seem to mind too much.
Who knew someone could be that turned on.
Or she might want to turn down the strength of that vibrator she has tucked in her cleavage. Just sayian.
She couldn't. She didn't have the remote.
Who wants to win a hearthstone game for mair to watch? v.
Uh lemme see if I have a quest for a class I actually like.
That was a trade.
This deck probably needs more minion.
That's a good draw.
Well I certainly wish that didn't have charge.
True but I'm glad he chose to face.
Otoh I'll have cards.
This opponent has had a game long identity crisis.
He can't decide whether to face or to to control.
I am at chicken rank.
Iii forgot to attack didn't I.
Yay I'm a Leper Gnome!
Woo the most leprous of them all.
I... am now facing hunter murloc?
Sex is like boxing If one of the participants didn't agree *it is a crime* Oh John Oliver.
You're slightly better than the tea analogy.
Nearly had to mop up said liquid after reading that.
Why is everyone murlocs!
Cos at these ranks people often have no cards D@.
Right that's dominance done.
And I'm up to murloc rank!
Cooked_Auto so my friend's TSW verdict uncertain but they would still buy it next time it went on sale is that a good enough cause for the key? And could you relink it if so? >.>'.
Mind you I think my key is for a non-steam copy of it just as an fyi but I can't be 100% sure.
No idea what sale is next.
Closest I can think of is Halloween.
I think as long as you have a valid log in you can use steam o.
MairBear SunTiger I like cutpurse.
Hm odd. The copy I got from GMG wasn't for steam so I don't think I can actually add that game to my library properly.
Not that it bothers me that much since you still have to use the launcher for it.
Though if you posted key there it didn't get through to me o.
MairBear Sure you can have it NQNTE987Q2GNX6LNVANS.
Although if you want the extra issues after that you need to buy them or just buy the ultimate edition.
Noted! But since he's phenomonally slow at games I doubt there'll be need for the later issues for a good while anyway.
Though I've only found all of two quests behind an issue-wall so far and I'm half through Blue Mountain myself.
Issue 5 the vanishing of Tyler Freeborn takes place on Solomon Island so it's pretty much the only one you'll find there.
Maybe some other mission too related to one of the other issues as they tend to add those in other zones.
It'll become a bit more apparently in Egypt and Transylvania.
Which is a pity because issue 6 and 7 are fan-fucking-tastic.
7 in particular is a huge buildup for the last zone.
Noted I'm pretty much ready to commit to getting issues when I come across them now. I like the game enough etc.
Issue 7 is great because it starts off very innocently before taking a couple of twists and turns before it whallops you with a doozy of a twist.
Issue 8 I haven't done yet but issues 9 to 11 you won't be seeing for a looooong time unless you burn through the content and get to the last zone fast.
I am currently on a path of do ALL the things at least for now.
Just work your way through methodicially because the next zone after Solomon will ramp up the available missions considerably.
They'll also get considerably bigger.
Or at least feel so.
Also friend send his thanks to you for the key.
But I only recently discovered that the dialogue each NPC offers has mutliple lines not just the first click v.
So I've been having a good listen to it all xD.
Oh yeah that. Funny enough some story mission later on will have you actually listen to that for progression.
It does feel that some quests could do with slightly more of a debriefing than is offered by your faction contact though.
Although a lot of those do tend to explain things decently in their own way.
Just not very obvious.
I was expecting something.
I was not expecting that.
Only warning is one of volume.
They are kinda loud.
I don't like it.
Fun one to pop out of shredder.
Esp if you have silence v.
Yes that's me going straight to trolden mode.
I do wish it was a 6 mana with less stats or something though.
A bit too late game for something that won't win.
Also I didn't realise the improved shaman pick a totem let you bypass the limit.
You could pick only taunts.
!note anathema irc4net has released 1.0 i'd like you to update your nuget package if you have some time free.
MairBear can i ask you a favour ?
I need either you or GlennCuttlefish to just sit in mumble for a bit.
So i can fix anathema horrible plugin.
Poke me tonight and I'll update the package not going out or anything.
I'm changing your overcomplicated attempt to join some strings in an array.
Well i have changed it.
I will admit tht that single piece could be better.
I just need to see if it didn't horribly break.
| _ -> c.Users |> Seq.fold fun x y -> sprintf %s %s x y.Name .TrimEnd''.
That is really simple.
Yes if you don't know you can just String.join i guess.
Yes I did forget string.join exists.
Damn didn't work anyway.
They neatly tostring themselves.
C.Users |> Seq.map fun x -> x.Name |> String.Join.
How do i get at the result from the map in the next step ?
Can you show me what bit?
Assuming the line you just pasted String.Join requires as the second argument the collection you are joining.
|> should handle that.
Because .Join has overloads you can't curry it and need to tuple its arguments.
Expect seq -> string but was type string.
String.Join'' c.Users |> Seq.map fun x -> x.Name.
Oh you can't explicitly access it under a name it only exists as an automatically passed thing ?
Did you paste the line I said exactly?
Or did you add on the joining argument.
I just pasted it exactly.
But realized something along the way.
`a |> b` is syntax sugar well an inlined function that just becomes `b a`.
Methods with overloads are awkward since they break a lot of the nice Fsharpy things like currying.
And its nice and neat now.
Thanks that probably saved me like an hour learning to do that on my own first.
Nae bother would be a bit of a dick move to write it in f# and then just not help.
Hey if this thing would have just neatly tostringed its user array to names like makes sense.
I'd have had it in one.
Instead it was all.
Yeah well I wrote those types in like 5m because I couldn't get the json type provider to play nice.
What is it with these cena memes.
Oh thats your thing.
I though that was just whatever library you were powering this with.
The structure of the response you get back is kinda weird.
Its all in Types.fs.
Did you solve the mumble thing suntiger ?
Well i have not added it to this PatternSpider yet.
And it only shows up if there is two people on mumble and someone uses the !mumble command.
But that extra at the end bothered me.
Oh sure. be like that game.
80% there and then I got wombo combod by 3x parry breaking thrusts.
You love it really.
I love it all the way.
Except for the UI and that one unarmed combat.
I guess I could wait until night and then buy medicine? Medicine revives you to full health when you die.
Accidentally created an optical illusion in my grid even rows have different background colours but on the lower half of the page they look the same but they have the same RGB values when checked in a tool.
Nope turns out my monitor is just crap and the colours are fucked on the bottom.
I prefered optical illusion over bug though.
How did you manage to break odd colums are a different colour ?
They aren't broken the bottom have of the monitor just has shit colour/contrast so it looked like as you went down the page the differnce gradiated away.
This is really annoying.
You'll never be able to unsee this problem in your monitor now.
I'd show you how awful the difference is if I could but its not like I can take a screenshot p.
You now what i like best about the steam machine should it actually take off ?
It sets a bottom bar for your pc game better run on these specs and my specs are better.
So i know my pc will run stuf ffor a long time >.>.
GlennCuttlefish if you want to try Rising Thunder rps just reported its open to all comers now.
SunTiger what are the bottom line specs?
2gb memory graphics card i3 dual core processor 4gb memory.
Higher options have been discussed.
The portable runs on 720p because small screen.
But 1080 is the target screen.
I can't get much more specific about specific hardware becuase there is no specific official steam box.
Well that was certainly an interesting plot twist in the other XCOM LP.
What happened did someone die horribly ?
If you haven't already read Speedballs XCOM LP I recommend it. It's interesting.
I didn't really want to get into a second xcom lp at the time.
If its not godawafully long.
I dunno why but I really like this.
I blame it on using the Knight Rider intro.
Why isn't Knight Rider on Netflix |.
This track is pretty good.
Possibly because of this.
I hope someone buys them rips them apart into 10 different pieces and forgets they ever existed.
As long as TSW keeps going the others can die. Even Longest Journey.
Why are you hating on good games suntiger.
He's bitter about no more Elder Scrolls for a while.
I'm hating on the studio that horribly mismanged them and doesn't know how to balance worth shit.
Well other than TESO 8D.
Fuck TESO so hard.
Grmbl why is my computer dying this time.
Well it's in Finland.
So I blame Megamelons.
Thats ancient history noelor.
Back when the finnish samurai still roamed the land.
The Doof trike is still the best thing.
Woop finished the first three zones only thing stopping me getting the done em all achievement is the dungeons.
Yeah I've only done Polaris and not The Darkness War.
Now onto the next faction mission and the next zone.
Polaris is pretty straight forward.
And quick. Its for QL4 or 5 while Darkness war is like QL7 or 8.
Shiiiet I was trying to queue with QL3 and a few QL2 xD.
What about the hell door one?
Good grief spend some pax on the auction house or something.
Cos that was listed as Devestating difficulty.
No idea about the QL level but that one is a bit more intricate and longer.
Oh no no that was before I checked AH.
And found out that stuff is actually quite affordable.
Pretty much all of the fights are puzzle fights.
Well yeah below QL10+ stuff is cheap.
And I'm planning to upgrade to at least ql8 or 9 now that I'm done in Blue place.
Unless people are dumb and overprice greens.
If you can just grab blues as they'll last you the longest.
Prices range from 9000 to the hundred thousands v.
But after a while cash gets really insignificant.
My faveourite is the loot that goes for hundred thousands when if you search one QL higher it's for less than 10k. And it's the exact same stat distrubution.
Some things never change.
Hm time to head off to the cafÃ© for a couple of hours.
Also the story quest is fucking with me. I'm having to poke altars and play sit here all day with 5 second fights randomly interspersed.
Have a good one.
Wait mairs somehow ahead of me now? I really need to pick that game up again.
But what can I delete!
Glenn Glennm Glenn you know me I get obsessed with a game and spend far too much time on it and then suddenly burn out outta nowhere.
Stupid TSW being so filesize c.
Only took MairBear 10 years to burn out on wow.
Has he burned out on wow tho.
Rising thunder feels pretty solid based on first match.
Loading times are horrendous.
I suspect loading times will be fixed much later in development.
Greece stronk! this grappler is pretty good so far. I dread the moment I come across the token shoto however.
Came across one. I think the fireball CD is a bit too long.
What do you think about the cooldowns in general aside from what you'd like to tweak ?
I've said it before not a fan of them.
Special shortcuts fine cooldowns just break the flow of the game imo.
Just wondering if playing had changed your mind at all.
Why would it have. I have never liked the idea in any game.
Just curious about if it did.
Not saying it would or should have.
Finally my first loss.
I figured your firsyt game would be a loss.
On account of not knowing wtf you were doing yet.
I ran practise mode for a few minutes.
Figured out controls one or two combos.
Including one ultra confirm.
That was a easy to pick up then.
Followed by a losing streak.
Then again these have been against silver and gold rank players.
Matchmaking probably doesn't really have enough player to go around to balance things out yet.
Minister Steven's bubble is basically an AT field.
Losing intensifies. At least I learned a few things in that game.
Game must have run out of noobs to pair you with.
Man that was so close.
Every match ended with both players with invisible health bars.
If you shopped at drivethru you'll want to read that.
I suppose I should have suspect it would happen from a company that still uses php and tables for layout.
It is not exactly suprising no.
Guyz we can all play the Wildstar F2P beta v.
After learning to love the boot my game has been going a lot better.
I would be up to playing wildstar tbh.
So basically if I bought something since July consider the card leaked?
Glenn Yeah I'd be up to but then I saw the F2P restrictions and just went nah.
Last time I paid for something on DTRPG was Feb.
Time to buy alcohol.
Hm not bad.
Think I'm okay bought something on Saturday and haven't had an email from them.
But my card does need replacing due to wear anyway.
I wouldn't laeve it to chance.
<- this person did not get metal gears message AT ALL.
Seems pretty tame for reasons to enlist tbh.
Like I said I wanna get a new card anyway due to wear.
Walking through athkatla the major city in bg2 and just randomly on the street there is a Marilith.
Anathema I can't remember which thing you're referring to that AT fields are from.
Also about to d/c.
For the unitiated a marlith is a massive half snake half woman demon with 4 arms the woman part is naked about as tall as two people.
I have enough in the way of sidequests though so she can just stay there.
I'm not asking what her deal is.
Oooh The Man from UNCLE movie goes up this week o.
And now viconia has the hand of a dead cleric on a stick as a mace.
Well at least its not creepy romance.
Mhm. I see you chose the mystery box.
MoonWolf you should totally see what snake lady's deal is.
Snake ladies are rad.
See Breath of Fire I II.
I'm just trying to get through all the unavoidable go do this now quests while gathing my intended party.
Like i need to get to a castle within the week or this other npc leaves my party.
Clearly snake demon ladies are even rader.
Ugh that's always the wurst.
A KENDER JUST TALKED TO ME.
And III as an NPC and some theorise in IV as an interdimensional ghost robot.
MoonWolf burn your PC.
Interdimensional ghost robot snake lady ?
Run the fuck away.
Breath of Fire is rad!
He ended up giving me a map to some location that probably has more quests.
MoonWolf you remember how in DnD4 the ultimate progression for every PC was to become as unto a god and part of the very fabric of the universe they inhabit?
Not all literally that but yes that was the general gist.
Ok well that happens to one of the characters from Breath of Fire.
Like a couple characters have descendants who are nearly clones of them whatever.
One of them is literally the same person.
She's the world's most powerful mage in 1 still around in 2 set centuries later and joins your quest for a laugh.
Then in 3 she's a goddess.
Pretty bored lets join this world spanning adventure.
It'll be a laught.
Keep me busy for a few months.
And there's a robot in 4 which isn't ostensibly even the same world which fans speculate is actually animated by her spirit too.
Lol i'd forgotten about that one.
Kirisu Neon Genesis Evangelion.
So in Baldurs Gate you are a Bhaalspawn offspring of the now dead god of murder. there is a ton of bhaalspawn because he has a plan on how to come back after his death.
Bhaalspawn get divine powers. but not really like a coherent set.
Different ones get different stuff.
Just sort of haphazard.
Viekang has the power to get struck by lightning and teleport away at the same time when he panicks.
Massive set of potential powers he gets struck by lightning and randomly teleported somewhere else when he panicks. also he can reconize other bhaalspawn this frequently causes him to panick.
Today I benched a full 5*5 @ 62.5KG new recoooord.
Anathema that's be why I didn't know what you meant.
Kirisu you've not seen NGE?
Once each and spread apart in time.
The first 2.2 movies*.
You should fix that it's really good holds up really well.
Except not the last two episodes.
My phone is only playing Iron Maiden despite being on shuffle all.
Watch End of Evangelion instead.
Anathema lecturing Minister on animez what is dis.
Why is that odd?
End of the world.
I don't hate anime.
I just have taste m8 ^.-.
Dob Well to be fair pleb taste is still a taste P.
It happened it finally happened a shaman card that can heal ... it has joust on it but still i'll fucking TAKE IT.
Ofcourse there was an army of accords.
Why wouldn't there be an army of accords.
Clearly someone wanted a moe accountant.
I mean its good but its not the anime jesus.
How can it not be the anime jesus with all the pointless religious symbolism?
I love that ADTRW has now been renamed VEGETA.
The best sound effects. The best.
The internet is a zany place.
The comedy in sonic boom is weird. it has brilliant jokes and a lot of jokes that fall really flat.
The game or the show?
There's a sonic boom show?
ChaosSmurf FLASH OF TWO WORLDS.
Hots on random matches this wk gonna be murder.
The f2p warrior is squishy and can't tank the f2p support has nerfed healing throughput and there's an f2p of the specialist with a srs skillcap req.
But right now bed.
Also we should HotS together at some point.
Is it just me or is there no alternative colours on qwertee anymore?
It all depends on the designer.
Since they did this new 3-at-a-time layout I've lost the ability to change them at least.
Most of them are lazy SOBs that only work with black shirts but others on voting seem to offer alternate colours.
You do that when ordering. If you can.
Darn then there just aren't alternates at all for todays.
And it still has less juggling than one match of tekken.
Following last night's session of Mutant Year Zero I took the second of two wrestle better talents for Opal the four-armed giant woman.
She now does as much damage unarmed as she would with a spear.
Seem like it would have been easier to just have a spear.
Quick name a cartoon character.
Opal is halfway between her namesake from Steven Universe and a Machamp.
How did you even end think of richie rich.
GlennCuttlefish i have NO idea.
He was very wise.
Here lies The Bhaalspawn he never scored.
Is not a thing you'll see on any gravestone.
Ehh. Still cant draw a clean line for the life of me on the table. also the eyes are way to rectangular. Wonder what else I messed up.
Come on and slam and welcome to the... murder?
Minister so much murder.
Good date witch great start.
Oh ffs cloudy morning but the sun comes out as soon as I step outside for lunch sans sunglasses.
MoonWolf Ashley's hair is p weird from behind in today's EGS.
Like I think it's just because it's black and monochrome and the inking style.
But it looks very flat.
Death is the XIIIth Arcana isn't it?
My computer at work is currently freezing whenever I try to select more than one item in Windows Explorer.
Also their phone ?
I fixed my computer's problem by restarting Excel.
I was about to suggest just rebooting the whole thing.
But if thats enough.
You're face is dumb.
I have tiny patches of sunburn on my cheeks.
Lol that is.. the most british thing.
The sun was shining for a few days now my cheeks have sunburn.
That show like the corners of where my sunglasses stop but it's still facing upward.
It looks like I missed applying rouge.
Minister i know you gained another elemental in OTS recently which type was it ?
Actually i'll just make all of the mnow.
Because in theory æœ¨ knows all the spells.
Like they're all in her spells known list it's just she's only previously memorised Earth.
Today desert survival more loot.
Sweet graphics card finally shipped.
On the very edge of the period.
3 to 6 days ship literally a few hours away from the 7 day deadline.
5 hours.
The best part if i check that product on their site now 1 to 2 days.
Jesus christ I am doing so fucking horrible today in this.
Dropped 2 ranks so far.
Uhm robot punchy game ?
Did you horribly overperform on your placement matches or something ?
Lost to a lowest tier.
Who could not combo.
Should have been easily punishable.
Pushing buttons is apparently too hard today.
Fighting games are hard.
But I just cant play today.
I keep missing easy timings failing reads and DOING STUPID SHIT LIKE JUMPING WHEN I KNOW ITS A BAD IDEA.
I am literally screaming at myself not to jump.
And I keep doing it.
I think maybe this controll scheme has not gotten into proper muscle memory yet then.
No its fine theres only one input I keep missing.
The not jump combo?
Its not a combo noelor.
Its just that jumping will get you punished 80% of the time.
Maybe i'll try drawing again for a while. Then I can be frustrated at other things!
I have so many pictures of zombies vs plants zombies.
Why are they in a desert.
Also should one of us take Favoured Enemy Undead at some point.
They are not in a desert at this point.
I was looking for something more desert suitable and realized again that i hav every many.
I don't know if favoured enemy undead will be relevant all the time.
But it'll definitly be relevant a few times!
Yeah it's a pretty solid favoured enemy if you're into that talent.
Like if Ember had ended up with Favoured Enemy it would be dramora sp.
But the second time level 7 it'd be Undead.
I do my best to create a varied monster experience.
Although within oblivion i'm somewhat constrained by the thematics of the story.
Much more so that OTS anyway.
Things from oblivion and cultists are just going to be a thing there.
Well as previously discussed I'm not a fan of favoured enemy anyway.
Would be great in TES generally.
Fucking cults all over the place.
13A's Favoured Enemy lets you choose humanoid but it counts as two talent slots.
Yeah on the whole i'm also just against favoured enemy from its very inception.
Either its used in the type of game where its always on because this just happens to be a game all about murdering every undead ever.
Or its hope the gm is feeling like letting your talents do something today.
And it changes group dynamics too.
Either you're fed up because you have a thing that doesn't benefit you.
Or everyone else is sick of having to fight an ettin every other week because you decided to be a snowflake.
Now this is cosplaying.
We're back to my favourite brawl so far.
Clearly monks are the best summoers.
Cast spell summon minion of that cost.
Are monks even in hearthstone?
The joke was more that they summon fists in their opponents faces P.
Only the core 9 classes.
So mage priest warlock rogue warrior paladin druid hunter shaman.
Anathema that is way too long to be tldr.
There's a lot of history m8.
Man my not braining good streak continues.
So I am trying to get a PSN game to work on my PS3.
Problem is that its signature is all whack.
So I resign the boot file copy it to the folder of the original remember that I dont know what folder its in on the PS3 plug my external into the PS3 look at the original path copy the original boot file to my external and plug it back in.
At no point have I actually copied the resigned file to my external yet.
Except as far as we know when people die in australia they stay dead.
But do they though?
Well I'm not so sure about Shadowrun Australia but in real life Australia I'm sure they do.
Fun fact Shadowrun Australia is normal Australia on drugs pretty much. It's really bad place to be.
*It's a really really bad place to be in.
Probably has a more vibrant colour palet than PoE though.
Well I'm pretty sure the sky can look pretty funky during a manastorm. But then again if you're stuck without shelter in a manastorm you're screwed.
For a good idea of what a manastorm might look like remember the storm part in Fury Road? Something like that but a lot more magic flinging about.
...PoE is pretty colourful.
Yeah with this expansion they added a ton of dark... purple... going on forever.
Contrasted by eyeballs and blood red tentacles.
Purple is clearly a bold new move in color palettes for games.
That's one zone m8.
Felt like it went on forever.
Well ok 2 zones if you count pre-Piety and post-Piety differently.
And ofcourse it was preceded by The Mines.
Which were claustrofobily dark and mostly brown.
You had kaoms dream that despite being literally full of lava managed to be dark reds.
Mostly just dark reds.
Damn it the billboard torrent didn't have the 2000 folder so it went from 1999 to 2001. And in one year pretty much everything had changed in music which is so goddamn weird.
You had that arena place which was an exciting brown with slightly less brown features.
The second half was cream not brown.
Or marble I guess.
There was an outside zone that i can't even remember that actual features of but it was probably brown ground with dried shrubbery.
The town had colours!
Dried lake was sandy.
PoE we love brown and greyish brown. anytime we try to use colours we make sure to damen the vibrancy way down and preferably make it claustrofobic and dark.
Don't want you to accidentally experience those colours.
The entire D3 expansion was basically a dark blue ruined city.
MoonWolf Clearly a ploy to make you go outside and experience real colours.
So is basically every rift.
I don't see why you sinlge PoE out so much basically!
PoE Every item you have is essentially shit and you will never have a good item.
And D3 builds are just as limited too -> collect a class set -> use that one skill the class set makes amazing until things die sometimes adding some utlity skills in.
KaunMoth one day I'll get a good drop _.
Anathema you're right about that last part and its my biggest problem with the current item design.
Where you basically have only class sets as viable way to push really high grift levels.
< yes you will and one day I'll use some other skill than sweep on my marauder.
Sorry sweep and leap.
KaunMoth tried Ice Crash or Cyclone?
I haven't only just got cyclone.
What level are you?
Like.. 40 I think.
Start leveling an Enduring Cry an Immortal Call and maybe a Moltern Armour when you get them.
I got a 2 handed mace with sweep +dmg life leach and something as long as I keep hitting things I don't die.
Blood magic is fun.
And leap just to zoidberg the hell out of/into a group.
Yeah I used to do that I switched to cycling around level 68 though 'cause I needed to be able to deal damage while moving 'cause I kept dying.
Anyway back to diablo 3 and its colours they sure as hell love to put fucking colours fog in levels.
But you know what happens if you stop walking and LOOK at stuff in d3.
Pff you may have colours but do you have *fishing* ?
Torchlight had colours AND fishing. Ergo the more superior.
Oh yeah that fourth thing was stun.
Look at the fucking detail.
Granted that is something Torchlight 2 lacked a bit.
Anathema also. fishing ?
Its an elaborate joke.
I must have missed the fishing pole drops.
Both times through the game.
Huh you can schedule games on r20 now? Neat.
Have been able to for a while.
<- HOLY FUCK.
Not as impressive.
GlennCuttlefish Lily no -.
I was about to ask why Wrynn is horde.
Then remembered that just means warrior.
I don't see Rhonin ever getting played.
Its a good source of cheap spells for spell synergy cards.
If I'm playing arena and have already got an Antonidas sure.
In constructed I don't know if he's got enough value for his space in the curve.
Maybe I'm underestimatin it.
Because I don't like Rhonin himself.
Clearly next in line for Corruption then.
Well he's de- yeah.
Well that fixes everything.
Clearly a corrupt ressurection plotline then.
Noelor CITIZENS OF DALARAN!
But here have a video about nihilism.
That would be great.
If i subscribed to vessel ?
MoonWolf>> shut up rhonin you're supposed to be dead.
Oh is it still in subscription.
BwaS yeah well maybe if the fucking aspect of time had his shit together time and place in WoW would make sense.
I only check it like once a week.
So now everything is all fucked up.
Look we keep killing Nozdormu and/or taking his power away.
Walk over zone boundry suddenly 5 years in the past.
It's not too shocking he can't quite keep things under control.
Should just leave chromie in charge.
Noelor I have never been this upset at a web comic ever.
That shit just aint right.
In fact the more I think of it that cat is a complete and utter bitch.
Hey kid your mother just acted as a bait for that dragon. Btw your dreams are impossible.
MoonWolf it is turn 2 and I have an Earth Elemental.
Druid's dumb in this mode.
I need to see yo uwin.
I also have a footman a wisp and a dummy.
This warlock is pretty much dead.
Unless he pull sout a miracle.
Why do you even have a 1 drop taunt in your deck warlock.
But i'll look into it tomorrow not now.
Welp the bot's sentient.
And more importantly a gonk droid Woo.
MoonWolf very very very few people have had a fishing pole drope.
No fishing? trash game 0/0.
Didn't you listen you just gotta be the elite of the elite to go fishing.
Fishing is the worst in any game.
MoonWolf broke my plugin.
I can probably use that as a reaction at some point.
Noelor THis is why I say Torchlight is the superior alternative.
So china just blew up.
Oh come on! I need hard drives and everytime something bad happens in the east the price goes up.
That reminds me I need to buy a HD for my PS3.
The Kaijus are coming.
Is it the Batman from the Lego Movie or a Batman movie where everything is lego?
Same Batman as from the LEGO movie afaik.
4m to copy 1.1GB of 57k files not too bad.
Also that needs pinging to like everyone in the channel these days.
Maybe but they'll check it out anyway.
MoonWolf malachai normal kill no deaths.
Fear my double totems.
Oh sure show the skeleton.
At first glance read that as Karazhan.
Wheres the important bits wheres the sword.
Dob WoW broke your brain.
Yeah something like that.
IN 2 WEEKS.
Cool Steven Universe gif.
So Noelor when you fancy heroes?
We need more Stevonnie in this world.
After actually seeing it that took a lot of balls.
GlennCuttlefish why aren't there any dogs in this video exploding from excitement?
Aw yiss royalty free no mentions sound packs.
Mairnai help I can't stop laughing at this.
Must... not... buy...
Do I save this in my reactions folder too?
It's totally in there.
Of course it is.
Earlier on while playing rising thunder MFW.
Switched character MFW.
Had the wrong servers.json in place.
Both more exciting than their gvg class ones at least.
Mage one seems... debatably useful.
You know what the best part aobut varian is.
Worst case he just draws 3 cards.
Worse case he's a war golem and an arcane intellect.
Its just straight up amazing.
And i'll regret this in 2 months probably the best card in the expansion.
We really want to make demon a thing.
Here's a hard counter.
Rather have something that can silence non demons.
Yeah okay but 2 classes play secrets and they are both very popular.
1 class sometimes plays demons.
Also I missed Healing Wave.
Okay i have an idea for a HS card.
Its Ben Brode 3/3 for 3. All your emotes get replaced with Ben Brode emotes.
Too expensive unless it also counters squelch.
If you silence the ben brode card that player can no longer emote!
Though I still am amused that Garrosh can play Varian.
Actually slightly relevant for anathema too.
Fuck yeah corvids.
But do they understand pointing ?
They are totes smarter than dogs.
Shit just got real.
This is a lot of discussion on a very silly topic.
Space Raiders remained at a retail price of 10 pence from their introduction in the late 1970s until late October 2007 when the price increased to 15p. It later increased to 25p before lowering to 20p. The price has continued to fluctuate reflecting the volatility of the underlying commodity prices. At the time of the original 5p price rise directors at United Biscuits received death threats.
Does it come in a single package? Because if not it definitely should.
Is this the innapropirate footwear to have on while operating tools channel ?
Wow never heard of grapheme synesthaesia before.
Its that time of the day again quick name a cartoon character!
GlennCuttlefish do i need to start preparing a list of obscure cartoon characters ?
If you want to make me practise drawing cleaner lines and learning basic structure with obscure characters sure.
Its okay to like dragonball.
Looks really good actually.
You death will be quick and pineless.
Huh. turns out I had my trees translated wrong.
What I thought were pines are actually spruce and vice versa.
Damn it my FF skin stopped working with the latest update <.
No more waifu for you.
Clearly. Even if it was just a darkened skin because the default bright one is annoying.
Oh barely any skins are updated to FF 40.0.
Why does that explain the blinding? Wouldn't slaves who can see be even better at blowing into a horse's vagina?
It makes perfect sense in context.
Context being this historical quote Now the Scythians blind all their slaves to use them in preparing their milk. The plan they follow is to thrust tubes made of bone not unlike our musical pipes up the vulva of the mare and then to blow into the tubes with their mouths some milking while the others blow.
History is a hell of a drug.
I would not say that at all.
While they have improved in fidelity and performance no fundamental new functionality has been added.
Hence they have been enhanced not augmented.
Fair enough I suppose.
It won't have enough lesbians.
Does it have lucy lawless as a grizzled veteran kicking ass and sleeping with hot young girls?
I don't think we need an ephebephilic Xena.
Minister I mean relatively young.
Well I think he meant young. Or so I hope.
Y'all should read the Bel Dame Apocrypha.
...or whatever the shit it is.
And why was there so much of it.
Shipment of explosives as we mentioned last night.
And then probably other things.
Video after the initial explosion afaik.
Is warlock deathrattle even a thing?
Not really very much.
I guess it's a 1/1 that keeps getting summoned for all your 1/1 summoning needs?
And... it synergises with things that kill your guys and demon things?
Man thats a pretty bad sword.
And then it got worse.
Shops can make things look worse yes.
I have no idea what is going on.
WHY DID ENEMIES KEEP COMING THOUGH D.
Soul of the Forest is a pretty good counter to Doomsayer it turns out.
Swipe summoned a spell damage.
I spent too long confused about where the enemy's other 2-health went.
Next turn Starfall also summoned a spell damage wiping the whole board.
So my enemy conceded.
I do dislike conceding opponents.
Even if I know I'm probably gonna win I'd like the personal satisfaction of making that number go zero.
Well due to the quest I'm on concedes actually deny me quest progression.
So it's even worse.
Deal 100 damage to heroes.
I now have 2 golden Shadowboxers.
Man I didn't know silent hills was this far into developement before getting canned.
I should really go to hell for actually saving this song on my playlist but I'm pretty sure I'd go to hell for a whole different things than this =P.
Never realized how simple the actual music track is for this song.
Then again I also saved Call Me Maybe vOv.
I have a Star Wars parody of that saved but I've stooped no further.
I will admit to playing Edge of Glory as I have a few head-canon rewrites to it.
Which was also one of the songs I saved from my billboard gathering spree but then I already had Applause Bad Romance Poker Face and Just Dance.
Man I really need to fix up my pop folder sorting I realize.
I'm on the edge / of tomorrow / and I'm a film starring tom cruise.
I'm The Edge - that's Bono - and I play guitar for U2.
Think it started when superb owl played it at like quarter of the way through.
And I thought you're nowhere near the edge of glory and I'm on the edge of boredom.
Is that a winamp association I see before me the handle towards my hand?
I honestly havent used winamp in ages I just cant be arsed to switch the mp3 association to foobar.
Blur w/o Song 2. Poor form.
Already have that one.
That's just the new stuff I gathered from a 15gb collection.
I withdraw my accusation.
I was wondering how long it was going to take someone to notice that or another track.
Hmm wondering now which is that 2nd... backstreet perhaps?
Maybe. Make it about 3 or 4 tracks then.
Or a bunch I guess p.
Just thoughts went to fuck it let's go all out 90's on the dance floor like I just don't care after macarena.
I think The Motherload is my new favourite Mastodon track.
!note MairBear found a periodically-updating Mega link for the SU songs to replace that torrent.
Strange how gimp goes balistic if you have the ruler enabled with a tablet.
I still hate that you can preview track courses in Audiosurf 2 /.
Didn't audiosurf 1 have a preview as well?
Yeah that's what's annoying.
Parts of Audiosurf 2 feels like a massive step back.
Really liked audiosuft 1.
The UI is just so bad.
Also the track calculation is kinda lame as well with far too heavy reliance on base drum in 90% of the tracks.
Without breaking down the individual instrumental tracks it's easier to just rely on pure thumps.
Yeah but that gets really dull fast.
Here's how the UI looks if you havent already seen it.
Yeah that small window to the left is all you have if you want to browse for music unless you use the search function. Which I think will give you both soundcloud and on disc results so it feels pointless.
Can it pull in spotify?
If so can they work with spotify to make it less shite?
Only seems to have soundcloud support.
Ah well licensing I assume.
The soundtrack for ODST is surprisingly great as background music for writing. Just perfectly mellow most of the time to not be in the way.
Mair Guess what I bought recently P.
Also damn that shit is expensive.
MoonWolf you will never get me to feel bad for Noeloring.
Have you considered feeling bad for not feeling bad ?
Oh well worth a shot.
Chinese army just dispatched 200 chemical technically also nuclear experts to tianjin.
So whatever the fuck happened.
Its not just a simple explosive.
Or maybe its from other stuff that got blown up in the process.
>Consider putting a Shakespeare quote on the board.
What play is that... Probably Hamlet.
Board for what ?
*A Google later* Oh it's Polonius... That probably means it was supposed to be ironic.
I feel like i'm missing some critical context here.
We have a quote board.
I put I like shorts... on it the other week.
Oh talking about shorts and stuff. anathema got his feet censored at work!
Also MoonWolf someone figured out an OTK for druid.
Do let me know.
Aviana innervate malygos 2x faceless and 2 moonfire.
Two innervates needed if you didn't get emperor the whole game long.
Omg HR have asked me to wear things on my feet when walking arond the office due to 'health safety' concerns.
Mairnai thats a very lategame combo.
But impressive if it works.
Yeah the rest of the deck is of course built around surviving and drawing into it.
How scandalous <- Dont you mean....How sandalous?
Dolph Lundgren is filming the previously mentioned Kindergarten Cop 2 now. D.
Wow that's petty Supes.
Thats a little out of character for superman.
The Fell's Five DD comic is on Humble Book bundle?! O Well and some other less good DD comics.
Giant bunnies are four times as dangerous as an oncoming train.
I missed reading that it was Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde #2 so for a second I was reeaally confused who she was.
Living the snaekfu dream.
Damn I thought I was gonna see karate snakes or something c.
Well duh its for the snake waifu dream.
Have you ever wanted to know the true power of the cabbage? Then this is the mod for you. Experience the experience that makes you experience experiences you never experienced before. The Cabbage gods are appeased by my rituals of truth. The real Cabbage knows how to disguise itself and if you eat it you absorb its true power.
Unrelated how do b.net tags work these days? Name.name123?
Or like Handle123 or email or...
Basically I feel like they change it a lot.
Its been that way for a long time now.
I've always known it to be the thing MW said.
Name as in Noelor#3836 or Chris.Storr#2929.
Basically I'm sure at some point it used real name.
And everyone was mad.
That s ystem existed for weeks at best.
But I want to give someone at work my battle net so actually I'd rather it was real name because that'd make sense to him.
You can use your email.
And I don't want anyone at work to be cognizant of the name Noelor.
That'll give them you proper name as the account name in friends lists etc.
Like for me on my list since i have you through your account email you are Christopher Storr.
I should fix my B.net name.
Also give you my tag number I guess.
No need the name tag number is the anonymized i don't want people to know about me method.
Everyone cna find those through battle.net interaction.
The account email is the one you give out to people you trust and is not exposed through battle.net interaction.
I never part-levelled æœ¨ on Wednesday.
Gah I'm starting to stress way too much about this name thing.
Oh yeah I just gave Cait Slick Feint.
Like I wanna play HotS with him but also literally 0 people in the office know the name Noelor.
Plus chris works well imho.
Oh the noelor thing.
Oh yeah I changed Christopher to Chris on all the things I thought about earlier in the year.
Though I still haven't got round to setting up a new professional life gmail.
Because setting up a new gmail with forwarding etc is a pain.
The Hunt for Rats in October shows the game's sense of humor with a series of puns regarding that classic piece of media. A number of rat tokens are placed on the board and both sides need to find and catch the damn things to get the bounty from the city. It's chaotic and ridiculous â€“ perfect for a game of pirates. There's typically a lot of scrambling to get rats violent confrontation.
And entertaining chaos. Hah.
Kirisu its not that hard.
Prhasing etc.
And it'd be my... 4th? I think 4th gmail.
Kirisu.Noelor for the internet ChristopherMStorr is the existing professional one I set up when I first started looking for work.
<- ths has to be the most ridiculous thing.
I have an old first.lastname@swipnet.se for that thankfully so I only ahve three.
And then when I started studying with the OU they set up a student account with extra drive space part of Google's education campaign I guess.
Oh yeah Ive had like 3+ education related ones as well but they're all closed by now.
It'd be nice if you could just alias different adreses to the same account.
Which is like mystudentid@open.ac.uk but is actually a gmail.
Had one of those as well.
MoonWolf I manage my OU one from my 'professional one.
I have moonwolf.crn perma forwarded to s.oudenaarden.
Set up automatic forwarding send as access etc ages back.
Headline in newspaper being read across the table from me I was stupid Dr Dre vows never to hit a woman again.
Very progressive of Dr. Dre.
Thanks for the reassurance Doc.
Oh last night I changed the default alert tone on my phone.
After years of the MGS ! it's now Steven's ringtone from Full Disclosure.
Of course I forgot to then switch my phone back to silent.
It was great to randomly hear in voip conversations.
So that went off in the office earlier at max volume.
I was phasing out ! anyway.
Like fewer things actually use the default alert on my phone these days.
I might switch it back though.
And put Steven's ringtone onto some specific stuff.
He can't even eat it.
I can't sex turtles okay.
Turtle you can't even.
Wow Facebook chat is the garbagest.
Here are the options for Facebook chat notification sounds.
Your phone default sound.
You cannot set a custom sound for only Facebook chat because... ???
That is garbage indeed.
Well I got riped into playing Eclipse.
But had to bow out after turn 4.
15 hours still in the tutorial dungeon.
Not even up to the boss.
Just trying to go past the first archer.
Noelor i don 't know if you care enough but in 90 minutes blizard is holding a stream bout the expansion.
Many people theory its where they'll dump all the remaining cards.
MoonWolf I'll be flat viewing.
But ty for the heads up.
One of the official mod samples for Witcher 3 is called Witcher the Slav D.
The thistle and the crescent Muslims seem happier to identify as Scottish than English hahaha.
1742 Space Saber. <- the butt plating is definitely good at being armour.
Noelor>> still up for some heroes sometime this evening?
Gonna order pizza first then do some b.net admin.
A guy from my office may join us at some point too.
The b.net admin is related to this.
XCOMment Shen Jr's tattoo from the brief glimpse I just saw seems p cool.
So it looks like they put all the good dragons in grand tournament.
Instead of the dragon expansion.
I'm going to rephrase that for you in an attempt to justify it.
It looks like they put all the good dragons in random packs instead of giving them away as fixed rewards.
Kalecgos' participation at the argent tournament is much documented don't diss.
B.net won't change an account holder's name without proof of legal name change.
I'm not deed-polling from Christopher to Chris.
Bear trap after your hero is attacking summon a 3/3 bear WITH TAUNT.
Get it its a bear and a trap.
B.net won't change an account holder's name without proof of legal name change <-.
Disciple of Magnificence Dorito.
Welp time to start backuping my PS3.
Time remaining 1h20 minutes. Good thing I downloaded a lot of stuff lately to watch.
And then after thats done time to start installing everything. Which will take a while.
And hopefully I can finally continue drakengard after that.
Dob working my way through the tutorials atm.
Noelor tutorials for what ?
Hots I would assume.
Is that Hearthstone stream voddable?
I hate music genres sometimes no idea if I shoud split everything up in my pop folder properly or just leave it a mess.
I love tihs expansion for priest.
Is she worth 6?
Depends on the matchup ofcourse.
Sometimes you just won't care or absolutly do NOT want to play it.
I guess she's *sort of* 6/5 for 4.
Ok let's watch this CivBE video ChaosSmurf news'd about.
Ft Pete Murray actual ghostbuster.
Sure hope he's learned how to play Civ since he did the promos for the base game.
You should come hang on mumble.
Sure but most of my attention is going toward Civ things.
And I'll either invite Dob in or disappear to skype him at some point.
Well I have a bowful of strawberries.
And half a can of whipped cream.
Time to partake in some good ol' hedonism.
Currently sorting about 800 different tracks into more proper genres.
Only 448 tracks left to go through =p.
I keep forgetting to buy a universal remote or something to configure my second monitor properly.
Also yays my CMS is working.
Anathema holy fuck this ram usage.
MoonWolf eh have about 20 tabs open in it atm.
I have 16GB of RAM anyway.
Give me some of your ram.
I'm also skeptical of it using less than chroem.
The dev tools leak memory too.
Well yeah it snto saying chrome is good.
Once had a dev tool tab using 1.2GB.
Its saying edge is worse.
Puh done with that.
I should get around to installing another browser.
I have 13 tabs in Chrome and it's using about 1.5Gb.
It's not that bad.
That is bad |.
Between all processes and two windows on two monitors?
It was worse on ubuntu.
Over 100MB per tab!
The app itself is using 120mb for two instances.
One process is using 20% of system and 310mb ram.
Hm.. what are you doing.
Most software is awful.
That's a given no one has the time or money to make it not awful.
My firefox is currently taking almost 2 gigs of memory.
Firefox stop the noms!
Its not that bad its only bout 13mb each tab.
That's... too many tabs.
Only about 150 or so.
Its not like I need most of these.
I just forget to close stuff.
Pretty sure my computer booted thursday or wednesday.
Throttlebottom - A dishonest public official.
Wait crapula is from latin?!
Nah they stole it.
I wish people stole my krapula more often.
Oh no Blackula stole my crapula.
To take it to Duckula.
I'm lucky I don.
't get a krapula that often.
Never really suffered the woofits before.
I did meet my niblings earlier today though.
I like how looking for the finnish word for hangover returns a lot of moomin pictures.
Also minus points to that article for not mentioning to have a dick on your forehead for when somebody is upset.
Hm. Still getting the disc read error in drakengard.
Guess I will try copying it to the internal HD now that I actually have some room.
Eugh Noelor and I chain running four and a half hours of heroes.
I may have burned through the bandwidth with all the voip just a bit.
Yeah that can happen.
...why is there a shaman hammer that turns you into a hunter when you lost it.
Someone needs to stab BawS' ISP for caring about bandwidth.
Right time to try again. Lets see if I can finally progress in drakengard 3 with the game installed on HD.
Well it worked. First end done.
Time for the game to get worse and weirder.
Endless repeats of the same areas lazy filler.
Is Frodan just a Blizz employee now or?
Hm leaving the window unlatched is a danger in this windy and warm day.
Good lord this is some dense bread.
<- this is the most redneck thing I have ever seen.
A Nekomancer a wizard whose powers revolved solely around cats.
Huh. I had figured shoulders at least partially right it seems.
That is not how a bear trap works.
MoonWolf some of these new cards are awsome.
And then there's.
MairBear but what if you upgraded your heal.
To heal self and do 4 damage to oponent!
Or the inspire medic.
What are these cards other than a total flip ofd all my paradigms.
Know that saying lightning doesnt strike twice in the same spot? Yeah that's bullshit. My house got nailed twice yesterday in under a minute. 2 of 4 TVs are dead as is an hdmi input on a third all networking gear all cable boxes garage door dishwasher and garbage disposal got hit. Oh and my computer. Bright side house didnt burn down and ive got a $2k newegg order coming ooow.
I like how some of the Grand Tournament stuff is like we tried to get you to play X deck and there weren't enough cards so now there's more cards for those decks.
Dunno if demon lock actually fits that yet but certainly beast druid dragon at all.
Lego Wall-E set in September.
...why is there a neutral taunt 5/4 for 4 mana in new set |.
MairBear BBBG is base set though >.>.
But is the first that I know of case where a new card is just better. Power creep and all thatl.
Just 1 mana less exact same role and function as the new card.
Sorry I missed what you were saying.
Oh this thing.
Disneys Jack and the Beanstalk movie is being called Gigantic will release in 2018 and is being directed by the guy who did Tangled.
I'll look into it later.
Man from UNCLE was solid through and through.
MoonWolf Yes I am in fact a Chinchilla.
THat's a pretty amazing response if anything.
Let me check my game has that one too.
I don't have that spell.
How do you even mechanise toffee.
<- is this actual concept art from Gigantic?
Because that just looks like a giant Rapunzel and Flynn.
Welcome to disney design.
Ember was just a formalwear question but I sorted it.
E-yup definitely hang over morning again. I've been thinking I should go back to bed for 2 hours now.
And instead of doing that I have just been sitting here browing imgur.
After not getting any further gigs Donte got desperate.
Well thats odd. multiman stopped working entirely on my PS3.
It just crashes the system now.
Everything else works fine not even reinstalling worked.
And now time to farm some gold and weapons.
You need ALL the weapons for the final ending.
And its a pain in the ass.
Because its boring bullshit things to get.
Ehh it doesnt seem that bad in this oene.
Hm. Pete's Dragon remake it seems. Also what I assume a movie based on Roald Dahl's BFG.
Although at the same time another Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Eh.
And Beauty the beast remake /.
Wait I still had some branch. no farming yet.
You'll have to farm eventually.
And read all the stories.
Reading the stories is mandatory.
Not completly safe for work.
This is leaving me very conficted!
Extremy nsfw if you have a thing for charts and or maths.
The recommended starting age for that game is 10.
Not quite sfw lesson learned.
That's why proper anal toys have like a bulb or w/e at the bottom so they can't fit in.
I like these rules.
Now i know pearl ha a large nose.
But its nto THAT large.
Why is she riding a bulldog.
And really likes hugs.
Strontium-90 an isotope emitted from nuclear fission is chemically similar to calcium. This means that when it is inhaled after a nuclear blast the body uses it as it would use calcium depositing it straight into your bones where it delivers beta radiation to your bone marrow.
Anyone want a steam key for any Shadowrun Returns game?
Already have 2/3 and no real intest in the first one so I'll pass.
MoonWolf Ember ChaosSmurf GlennCuttlefis?
Already played it give it to someone who hasn't. Thanks for the offer anyway.
I have the base game but any and all expansion are quite welcome.
MoonWolf KTB0Q-E4C34-C0II9 3QZV8-HP8J9-6PCKB.
I mean if you want to get rid of a basegame key I can grab one otherwise.
NZQAX-XYV4B-R2FA7 as long as it isn't languishing in my backerkit page I don't care what happens to it! p.
Sell it to terrorists.
Heh one of the Dragonfall songs is called 'Du Heist'.
One of the really good ones on that soundtrack as well.
Prefer Horn Ivory or Calling All Runners more.
Oh yeah got an LSB episode to watch.
Puppet masters is great I liked the menu theme a lot.
Hm exactly 160 games on steam now.
How dare you own more games than me.
Huh 104. I thought I had more...
Depending on where I like I have either 159 or 160 games vOv.
No wait only 159 because its a CivBE free weekend.
Ember Big Hero 6 confirmed for Kingdom Hearts 3 btw.
That's one helluva casting I can almost smell the oscar bait.
My room feels like Grand Nightbug Station for some reason.
Kinda hard to concentrate on writing when you get buzzed constantly p.
MoonWolf I got the first volume of the Steven Universe comic - there is a sequence in which Amethyst transforms into various types of bird and gets told off for mocking Pearl's nose also Pearl stabs Amethyst with her nose.
Wait...I thought I had to get all weapons for branch D?
Oh nvm I do its just sitting there taunting me for now.
I thought I was going to have to farm for weapons.
I have 2 weapons to buy now I did one gold run farm run so far.
And its 2 cheapest weapons at that.
Noo I still have some sidequest or chest to find.
Ah well doing this payday and upgrading some weaponry before I start working on that.
Now upgrading everything is going to take a while.
But my lip eating breakfast because I am a pro~.
What about your lip eating breakfast.
But all over it.
And certainly no autocorrect fucking anything up there.
Thats what i assumed.
Cooked_Auto would you like me to return anything I won't/don't use?
Went to bed at 10 still barely slept fml.
Sigh bing expired my geocoding key for some reason.
Getting sass from my own bot.
MairBear Nah keep it.
Found a book to put it on.
Is it a new monitor or a new monitor?
Though the model is a couple of years old.
And it's only 23.5 inches or something.
Watching the Lucio vid.
It's definitely an Overwatch trailer.
Justice rains from GACK.
Alright she got someone the second time.
This character looks stunningly boring and really overpowered.
The aura has so much range.
Should have given him spraycan for maximum Understanding the Concept of Love.
Will Overwatch finally be the game where Blizzard has some non-oversexualised female characters!?
It's so weird to me the amount of shit Blizzard get for their character design.
When for example this.
Thats a horrible argument smurf. Even if I think everybody should be even more sexualized in videogames just for the hell of it.
They have a better designed cast than maybe 80% of video games.
These guys are doing something worse so that guy should not be criticized.
But get more shit than basically any other company.
I didn't say they shouldn't be.
I said it's weird how much.
Well yes senran kagura is a somewhat obscure japanese game.
Senran kagura is just the first random game I saw this morning.
Where as blizzard is a prominent western dev of course its going to get shat on more here.
And nobody ever actually praises diverse character design.
Or any other AAA tbh.
So why would companies ever do it.
Also because everything is weirdly sexualised in their specific cartoony artstyle which otherise would be great for kids and stuff.
Because AS SOON as someone goes.
This has a diverse cast.
Jokes come out of the woodwork to go NO IT DOESN'T LOOK AT ALL THESE WHITE DUDES.
MERCY AND SYMETTRA BOTH HAVE HIPS DO YOU HATE REAL WOMEN'S LEGS BLIZZARD.
And there are like 2 playable female characters in Hearthstone? Jaina and the rogue both are cleavagey and wearing corsets.
And the new hunter isn't either of those things.
Inb4 PAY FOR DIVERSITY OMG.
So why even add sexy cleavage ladies.
Because it's art they had lying around.
>implying Blizzard can't afford to pay artists.
>implying art is cheap.
M8 they can afford Oracle licenses they can afford artists.
You always reuse art in card games.
As much as possible.
I think I am missing 2 weapons.
I fear I know what they are as well.
Ok but really how long would it have taken to do two reasonable portraits for hearthstone?
Its those bloody follower weapons.
Anathema and they do afford artists but they also have this massive utterly free catalog just lying there.
As long as it would take to do two bits of art that actually need done.
GlennCuttlefish oh they they lik eyou weapons ?
Finally chcked that senran kagura video those are some serious jello boobs.
Senran Kagura is basically softcore porn in game form.
I just expect better of someone like Blizzard.
Its not a useful criticsm point.
I don't know why.
When they've spent years having a pretty even split between sexy and not.
It's just their sexualised stuff is really sexualised.
So it stands out more.
Plenty of fat panda chicks in WoW eg.
Name a plot-important one without googling p.
I literally couldn't tell you two bosses from this expansion.
Princess whatshername from...that place. road there is full of centaurs.
But there was a trio of orc women in Blackrock Foundry that were all fully armoured up.
GlennCuttlefish wasn't she a rock.
Princess I am counting that one.
Urgh Jaina is even wearing boobplate.
I am fairly sure that is not armour.
Well I'm not going to zoom in on her boobs at work.
Is your real complaint.
That you can't play Hearthstone at work.
I don't even play it anymore.
You can be honest here.
ChaosSmurf have you seen the rogue portrait without its cropping ?
It gets pretty bad.
Like if you don't know you think the golden stuf fon her hip is just... pants.
That's probably why it's not included anywhere in game P.
Well now I have to see this.
Well it was less interesting than I hoped.
Just poorly designed armor.
I like to think my winrate with Jaina in HS is so high because opponents are distracted by the boobs.
Like i even really see portraits.
I see the warlock one.
Because every time I see it.
I'm filled with an unholy rage.
Did you see my screengrab on twitter.
From that poor paladin.
I never get any.
I play a lot of hunter.
But that's the first time it's happened.
I rage added someone once.
In that I lost and then added one.
But then we had a nice chat abotu what a close game it was.
Yeah but this guy is proper raging.
This is apologize for playing that race levels of anger.
I've got up 6 ranks since then.
Oh great i'm on your friendlist under my full name.
Though not playing Hunter.
I would like to apoligize for everyone who has me realid'd.
That must be annoyingly long.
Nah it's not THAT much longer than Noelor's.
He tried to change it to chris two days ago or so.
They want fucking LEGAL PAPERS.
I've been so lucky with Blizzard stuff.
So glad I never added that Blizzcon autheticator that then broke.
Fairly fucked when I change phone I think though.
That Blizzard stylise it StarCraft.
Despite the massive capital C in both.
Yeah and it bothers me every time i remember.
Nearly used to writing World of Warcraft now.
Look how wrong Starcraft looks though.
Best photo of me from the wedding on saturday.
Sorry i mean wrists.
Whose wedding was it.
At least you can't see any collarbones.
ChaosSmurf guy I worked with in my first Cambridge job.
Wait when did my team switch back to those two.
Probably because at some point they were the only two available ?
I start full time at PCGN today.
I don't know if I mentioned it here.
It's an uncontracted pay cut.
Does this prevent you from doing freelance on the side ?
But it's at least the illusion of permanence.
I have already gotten in trouble for doing stuff for RPS on the side.
I could probably still do Playboy/Vice/Console sites.
But direct competitors is a bit of a nono.
What is the N?
It stood for network.
Now I don't think it really stands for anything.
I predict two weeks before I'm complaining about having the best job in the world again.
What does a full-time games writing job involve?
Take 10 on Charisma P.
Cooked_Auto try again ?
I would just like to get a match on tinder.
It took me a while.
And I had to drop my standards.
I am not picky p.
But then there was Kirsty who was nice but not particularly attractive and a bit weird.
And Amy who looks like she descended directly from heaven.
But the drawback with her is?
She has asthma so bad she takes 14 steroid pills a day.
And probably some other miscellaneous stuff.
But not crazy? I mean I wonder what would happen if you got a crazy stalker gf.
Mines at the door.
Omg PatternSpider learn to do multiple replacements.
I got a book for my monitor.
And now everything is wonderful.
Wait I already said that.
Point is it's lunchtime.
Should grab something to eat as well. got hungry after my walk in this heat.
This is brilliant.
Now you can experience the real true final ending!
Remember the creepy spider-masked Brotherhood specialist Fith'Arach? Well he notices and becomes just a little bit more creepy by developing a crush on the creepy spider-Amazon. D'aw.
The most common Enemy at IOU is one's roommate. Haha.
The hell. what on earth was this bosses weak spot.
I just killed it through it armor in the end.
Dat glorious noise.
Super Chef VEGETA.
In character creator vs ingame.jpg nws.
Doom feels the funk.
And now in the living room the old Swedish pasttime of Ikea furniture building has commenced.
Getting really pissed off at how late all my players are to my game.
There's an entire channel of these~.
Enjoy your pages upon pages of cute turtles ?
Thats not a turtle at all!
Replaced it suddenly room seems brighter.
Noelor So yeah that image was official art of the movie.
Like I'll still watch it.
But Disney are so bad at different people -.
They really seem to like the rogueish genric love interests latetly.
Yeah he's a lot like Flynn.
Compared to the girl.
Anathema did you find a HD collection of Steven Universe in the end?
Janos is looking for the same.
Whats wrong with giant rapunzel.
It'd be nice if they had more variance in their character models.
This world order sure is different to their usual fare.
And yeah PS doesn't do unicode.
I was about to ask why Arthas was in Oblivion but.
Then the other things.
What a shock!
...well that was odd formatting.
This needs to occur.
I agree Ellen suits the Eternal Flame Baby.
Man people being wrong in those replies.
Its the hobby of people.
Gnome is playing an Occultist in LP13A.
And now I want to make one again.
You always want to make one.
I always want to make half the class in 13A.
!note Noelor yes for season 1 on kickass torrents.
Any of you guys use a Steam skin?
<- new card golden variations got datamined.
New daily types win 3 with one hero and win 5 tavern brawls.
Polymorph Boar - It's always Huffer.
Brave Archer - This is a bearly concealed reference.
MoonWolf which skin do you use metro?
Metro yeah the latest release thats a bit more win 10 ish.
Can you change the colours on it?
I don't hate it but it's so bright.
Anyway yes you can.
Or download this.
Oh sorry I'm an idiot.
I was thinking of.
No clue for that one.
I quite like BluePulse.
I assume its very blue ?
Not for me at all.
ChaosSmurf <- what mine looks like right now i like it a lot.
Cooked_Auto that is some sweet doll cosplay.
Thats looks like rolemaster.
Put an offer in on a flat yesterday afternoon.
Waiting for a response is now killing me.
MoonWolf that's fairly excellent.
MoonWolf good luck D.
I believe you meant minister.
And good and fine.
I'm sure my anxiety will recognise that at some point.
Cooked_Auto that's me today.
Sunshine and blue skies here.
So the thread asking if this nsfw is acceptable armor design so far people seem to agree with me in that its not really a good comparison to bikini armor and should in fact be either proper armor or go full barbarian.
Also a whole lot of bara in that thread.
Bah. got to the third part on my first proper try.
But I think I will leave this boss for later.
Also will just watch the ending on youtube.
Because fuck you yoko taro.
Do you know the final fuck you of that thing ?
You mean the final 2 notes?
I mean the note that you need to hit while the screen has blacked out and zero is given her outro narration.
I think there are 2 of those.
Like a second apart.
But yes. Which is one of the reasons why I chose to just watch it on youtube.
I cant deal with that.
So I have been thinking of downloading diablo 3.
Does it cost extra?
Well it would cost the price of a new game if I hadn't modded my PS3.
!note Noelor a food replacement thing from germany so you can actually buy it.
Less than 4 euro per meal.
Like Â£2.70 per meal.
80 euro including VAT for a week.
How many meals is a week?
Cba to maths it trying to finish work to leave on time.
Â£58 for 21 meals just ordered some.
That video is too spooky for me. And no I am not being my usual rascally racist self when I say that its just that aave is the finnish word for ghost.
I am now actually buying a flat!
Seller said yes to my offer.
Now comes the mortgage and the lawyers and cetera.
So after not-finishing drakengard I have moved on to a better musou kinda game Samurai warriors 4.
I think I accidentally picked the lu bu of this game as my first character.
The moves match if not damage then styles wise.
I can get into that.
Sure I can buy that.
MoonWolf you playing this Diablo patch if and when?
ChaosSmurf yes when it comes out.
Mutant Year Zero continues to be great.
The slaves of our colony banded together under the influence of the religion we invented to hold a revolution.
Now very few people have slaves instead there's a new faction of the slaves who all just follow one guy also former slave possibly puppet of our gearhead.
A few people died during the uprising mostly by accident and our boss and I smuggled away their corpses because both she and my baby eat raw flesh.
And like nobody's questioned this so I think that's actually just how we get rid of corpses in our colony?
Anyway my inventory now contains a corpse.
My baby is also in my inventory because that's the sort of game this is.
Thats a l ittle creepy.
Perfectly normal PC behaviour.
By the way one of the changes in the patch is that you can type new into the search bar and it'll filter out specifically new cards you've gotten from packs recently.
Really this chapter serves absolutely no purpose beyond introducing two of the main characters with possibly the most goddamned ridiculous names in the entire EU Trig and Kale Longo sons of Von Longo.
Oh god I can't even say that name without breaking into fits of giggles.
2214 By the way one of the changes in the patch is that you can type new into the search bar and it'll filter out specifically new cards you've gotten from packs recently.<--- HOLY PISS.
WOW SCREENSHOT FORMAT LEVEL.
I remember not having much issue with that once I found an app that just converted all of those into jpgs v.
Yeah think the old decommissioned desktop has a stack of .tga's in it.
Pretty sure I still have that program on one of my externals.
Sweet jesus latest AMD driver update lets me crank my main screen resolution to 2560x1440.
Texts gets really goddamn tiiiinyy.
Yup you'd need to increase the dpi.
Kirisu grats on flat btw.
Is it considered rude to ask how much it is? although I'm not even sure I want to know.
Good job that g uy.
This project is deliberately somewhat difficult to get running requiring reading of the code and undocumented manual configuration of some things.
Anathema 98k for a 2-bed flat in a nice suburb of Newcastle.
That is ready to move into like I need to furnish it and maybe put on a lick of paint.
Dad's tripling my mortgage deposit.
Ie he's giving 20 I'm giving 10.
Samurai warriors 4 is teaching me that japanese warlords are really inefficient at killing their enemies.
Kirisu literally less than half the price of down here |.
Fuck I hate this place sometimes.
Total cost of all virtual machines in domain name nishkriya Â£1.69.
Yeah nishkriya isn't exactly pushing high amounts of anyhthing.
2.5GB of incoming traffic!
Most of that will be the scraping.
But it is running in a whole VM.
Game is still on for tonight right?
MoonWolf are you ready.
Is your body prepared?
Right I have about 1.5 hours.
Then I have to start preparing hamburgers. Until that more fantasy finland.
<- peter parkers daughter... is called ... anime.
Welp seems I am out of hamburger sauce.
Wonder if I can make one quickly.
Argh out of mayo as well.
Guess I will just skip the extra sauce then.
Oh boy I did find a mystery mayo.
Its either going to expire in...2 days.
Or it expired 2 months ago. It did still taste like mayo so.
GlennCuttlefish i wouldn't if i was you.
Hm...Well time for experiments.
Well so far I put that suspicious mayo garlic pepper mix paprica powder ketchup and dill mayo into this.
I havent even dared to mix it yet.
As long as it doesnt combust or start melting through the bowl it's fiiiiine.
Was cleaning the measuring cup. grandmother walks by me muttering and now we just killl everything.
Also in the end added chopped pickles and mustard.
Turned out really good I think.
Oh those quirky old people.
She was continuing her war against snails.
What form does that war take ?
My dad fought against snails by picking them up with one of those grabbers that groundskeepers use to pick up trash and then chuck them in a bucket full of water v.
Well she collects them in concentration jars and then boils them.
Real snail hate there.
My fingers are apained.
So from talking to my tutor the Bastion songs are in a mega-weird tuning.
Tutor also asked if I listen to any actual ssongs instead of just heavy metal and weird videogame music.
As an example I own a house in london. I'm by no means rich but I have a fairly decent income and significant savings.
Maybe he inherited it and little else or something.
He could be rich if he sold it.
Or better yet started renting it.
Apparently there's nothing but priest and hunter playing hearthstone today D<.
Yep alternating between being mauled by hunters and never being able to get a board against control priest.
Fuck it. Someone link me that steven universe high quality torrent.
Anathema I just read Boris Johnson saying that Labour don't have majority support from voters and new my brain is on hold.
Brain is so on hold irc times out.
Fixed a bug where Righteous Fire calculated an incorrect radius when you were using Righteous Fire while also being affected by an enemy's Righteous Fire.
'The Fossilized Spirit Shield has also been renamed to Fossilised' yesss.
Sure was a critical change.
2 day into his fulltime position at pcgamesn ChaosSmurf runs an article advocating a HS card nerf.
Nerf finally coming for Blastmage?
Yes thats what i meant blastmage.
Its finally getting destroyed.
Tempted to alias my 'git notice' command to 'notice-me-senpai'.
Do it fgt I.
I am sometimes astouned by my brother inability to clean up after himself. Came back into the kitchen to find the box with the cuttlery left open.
I genuinely have a choice right now with regards to my mortgage.
Between dealing with an arsehole who will save me more money.
And dealing with a nice person who will cost me a little more.
Apparently I'm a video game.
How often would you be interacting with these people.
Quite a lot but only for the next few weeks.
And how much would the asshole save you.
Fucking cocks I hate this office.
Well that's what I have to spend this evening working out.
Meanwhile in fantasy finland musou 4 nobunaga seriously needs a new hobby.
The dude just appears in random places spars with characters for 20 seconds and then claims worthless! and just walks away.
Well he's fucking Nobunaga.
Hmm texas smokey hickory ketchup works so and so with meatballs.
I would assume its a bit overwhelming?
The Felix one is a bit on the weak side in terms of taste.
As is with every felix ketchup.
Not that I mind I like ketchup that does not cover the taste of everything else.
Thats some high level makeup skills.
Aw yis it's time.
Shadowrun Hong Kong is out.
The real reason my boss was working from home this afternoon is revealed.
..wait how is it out.
On Steam and GoG?
No I mean I thought they hadnt even started working on some stuff.
Now where is that soundtrack I was promised when I pre-ordered it.
Guess I was out of loop.
Also guess I will have to download it now.
I mean they're making a Battletech kickstarter soon for their next game.
Got 50 TGT packs for free.
Taking payments to stop supporting the nerf patron cause.
1500 words on a children's card game.
This is how we do.
I'd join for fun times.
But I'm at a mate's house on my laptop.
Because my internet was down for most of today.
MairBear TSW Issue 12 is out btw.
I cleared Egypt yesterday... I felt a bit deprotagonised at the post-boss cutscene.
Funny enough one of the new challenges is doing an action mission in Egypt.
Hint do not do the first mission you encounter.
I like a forum explanation The Orochi sergeant was just a higher level than you at the time..
I prefer the You were tired.
I still don't have any of the issues yet.
Mind you things are going to ramp up a little in transylvania in terms of difficulty.
Cooked_Auto I'm in mostly ql9/10 green things or their blue equivalent. Should be enough.
Pretty sure you're close to be able to do the Tyler Freeborn missions.
MoonWolf I play the spell flinger card in brawl.
Either I missed this episode.
Or this series started being on some serious and most likely illegal shit right when I stopped.
GlennCuttlefish what series ?
Nope just missed that episode it seems.
Probably takling about the uncle grandpa episode then.
Its not even canno.
Wtf was with that episode.
I was talking about the cat fingers episode.
You missed catfingers ? you missed a great episode.
MairBear get on mumble.
The episode wasn't cannon.
The cannon was canon.
And ships were sunk.
<- Luke Cage professional wrong-be-er.
This series would be better if it was just universe.
Well the shows name is not greg universe.
Steven on his own would be p dull.
I was more trying to imply that they should remove steven.
Does he get better as time goes on?
There is something wrong with that onion kid.
Man greece sure is lucky right now.
Two general elections and a referendum in the space of a yr.
Still waiting for the corps to sweep in and just buy the country.
Because this is clearly a beliveable scenario.
Certainly a lot of references in this thing.
That onion kid is a thing that happens.
Needs more skulls.
Pizzeria granny best character so far.
I love how tales of threads always degenerate into the important things.
Just opened my brawl pack.
2 dupe commons 1 dupe rare.
Sweet onyxia and tinkmaster.
Not the best legendaries.
But i'd take em.
Tum-te-tum click *5... that was two explosions.
Noelor it sounds like i'm going to be in Newcastle toward the end of September. Will provide details later and so forth. But just a mention.
I think thats enough SU for now.
Im sure the others would disagree if they were not busy/awake.
Infernal Charm Trees.png.
Well I just preformed my lazy trick of the day by turning off the table fan next to me with my foot.
I slept 9.75 hours last night yet still had 'low' sleep restoration according to my magic wristband.
I think your magic wristband is perhaps not magic enough.
MoonWolf it doesn't help me sleep it just tells me how well I slept!
I need magic pills or w/e to sleep better.
Steel is my body and jet fuel my blood.
Not known to melting nor known to death.
Okay who put drugs in noelors tea.
So that's where the magic pills went then.
But this morning's filter was bought and delivered by another team member.
Such a fake brit.
I'm drinking quality tea here.
MoonWolf does it have cardamon in it?
It had mint in it.
One thing that is starting to annoy me with fantasy finland musou is that all the talking takes so long that by the time you get your actual orders you have already failed it by killing the wrong guy.
Pretty sure you're supposed to play through the game so many times to get 100% that things become rote memory.
I love me some videogame drama.
Anathema okay some of that shit was pretty scummy.
Today's forecast was for overcast bit of rain.
Currently sunny and mild.
I have no sunglasses and my eyes hurt =<.
This feels vaguely like plot happening in SU.
Yeah that happens eventually.
GlennCuttlefish it creeps up on you that way.
<- apparantly zimmy punched annies dad in the face ethereally. go zimmy.
Did anyone else read that white-hat report on Android pattern locks' predictability?
I keep my phone wihtout a lock pattern so I do not have the illusion of security p.
I am not sure my phone even has some fancy ass lock pattern.
Non of that is suprising.
Nobody is suprised people picked easy to remember and execute geometric patterns for their locks.
Are you allowed to use some number multiple times in those?
Es you can cross nodes.
Someone write my javascript for me I have lost the ability to think.
O = this whileo.parentnode != null { o = o.parentnode } whileo.firstchild { o.removeChildo.firstchild }.
This will fix everything.
Bah hit my leeching cap. Guess I will have to do desperate deeds and...Buy shadowrun hongkong without testing it.
Then again previous ones have been good so I trust this one.
Pff I say to google bus from here to Winchester and it pretends not to know where I am.
I know it knows more about me than I know of myself.
You probably told google to pretend it doesn't know.
MoonWolf there are quicker ways to delete the whole DOM.
Probably but i couldn't remember how to acces to root DOM node.
Window.document.removeChildwindow.document.childNodes1 // first node is the doctype.
!weather remember Cambridge UK.
Minister Big Hero 6 shirt coming this weekend it seems on Qwertee.
Oh Agents of Shield is now getting a spin-off series.
MoonWolf if you cross a node it doesn't count the second time.
Minister sure but you are allowed too.
But say my pattern is =.
The phone doesn't care if I get from 9 to 1 by crossing back and dodging 4 or going all the way round the bottom or whatever.
It does care that I go 123789 every time as opposed to 123987 or 789123.
Hm it's weird now that TSW pretty much has dailies now.
Minister what to me is the most important part isn't the actual pattern the phone remembers its the pattern you remember. and thats where crossing nodes and if you're allowed too is critical.
Cooked_Auto is it though?
And any unluck pattern that is going to involve crossing is likely complex enough its not easily guessed.
Minister Well its more weird that it took them this long to actually add them p.
As in they got added this week pretty much.
Honestly the biggest thing for me in that article was remembering to switch off the trace line that shows you and anyone else looking at your phone your pattern as you swipe it.
In that case I agree.
I mean that the feature would be added would be a given.
What's up with tSW anyway?
Did it do a FFXV or something?
But that it took them until now to really do it is the more peculiar since Issue 11 their last major update got released in May.
I feel like I hear a lot more about it lately than in the however many years since its launch.
Pay Once and it's yours and then you buy Issues aka DLC after that to get some extra story tidbits and more endgame.
By do a FFXV I mean massively revamped.
What was previously known as do an SWG.
They had one revamp last year or something like that.
Issues instead of episodes because... Comics?
Dunno why they're called issues tbh.
But they are for all rights and purposes DLC since most of them have self-contained plotlines that have some relevance to the main plot.
Anyway bike home time.
Hmm think I've found my token glory supporting jleague side of choice.
Dwayne The Rock Johnson who will voice the character of a demigod what do you mean will voice?
MoonWolf thought I'd try do my dailies on my summoner before going out quickly get to Zana map lady level 68 I was level 60... zone monsters drop no loot 400% experience.
Went up 5 levels in half an hour.
Wasn't even sure I could do a map 8 levels above me!
I have decided to make and try a warrior pirate deck.
No idea how this'll do.
But I'm only rank 22.
And need to do my dailies by means other than brawl for once.
Note to self spellpower is real good don't let enemies keep it.
I'm going to go sit on this mumble server.
And see what happens.
First we tried getting the wii working again on our friday games couldn't do it.
So there we are trying to figure out what to do today.
My friend asks hey have you heard of this animation series steven something.
And now I never want to see the first half of season 1 again.
Not even catfingers ?
Also got a new phone from my friend. Well I say new its an older android.
Not sure its even newer.
Than my old phone.
But the important part is that its not a lumia.
Well time to try shadowrun. Wonder how many missions I will manage without cheating.
I suspect 2 or 3 again because I am awful at strategy.
Hit the one in the dress.
I'm not quite sure what to make of the tw acc of this careers site I use.
They're tweeting at 8pm on a friday their commitment to their job far outweighs my commitment to the process it's not helping.
Man I cant remember if my troll was melee or unarmed.
Han'on trolls in shadowrun?
Isn't it a cyberpunk mythos?
Okay so basically its what you get when you build a cyberpunk world.
And then one night magic is just unleashed into the world.
Yeah Shadowrun is cyberpunk with a splash of fantasy and magic in it.
Yeah maybe you didn't get the memo but shadorun has all the fantasy races and shit.
Elves dwarves orcs trolls dragons werewolves.
All of those exist just that most of them are mutated humans.
Well they started as that but now they're their own species.
I am not sure what the deal is with dragons.
Just that you should never trust one.
Oh right yeah I definitely didn't get the memo. Maybe I just read the re whatsit title at the top and moved on to the next memo.
Dragons are special with that they're dual natured if I remember right.
Or I could do something different with miss fatale this time and go physical adept maybe.
I stand corrected thankee.
Half Astral and half terrestirla or something. Which does mean they can't go into space.
Well no dual natured creatures can really go into space because it lacks an astral die or something like that.
Classroom*Crisis. 5 mins into an ep the cast are singing along to the opening cinematic while having a karaoke glowstick rave on a coach.
I tried to link 2.
Well not even out of the first map and already ran into a game breaking dialogue bug.
Fortunately had an autosave a few steps back.
Noelor mind a 3rd person leeching for free exp boost? Dc.
Err.. I mean uh... totally pulling my weight in HotS. Yeah.
After this game sure.
Welcome to the funtimes.
Next time I'll also be able to be social in voicewords.
Voicewords are the future.
MairBear MoonWolf SU spoilers.
Smoke alarm just got set off by steam from the bathroom because technology's great.
That sounds like something that shouldn't happen.
Don't give Splatoon a free week I have important grown-up stuff to do this week.
How is Naan only good C.
Well its no onion bread.
See a skyrim mob called flaming weapons pack.
Click on it thinking its going to be weapons that are on fire.
Turns out its just flamberge's.
Onion bread sounds that horrifying.
So last night in the pub we came up with a way to unambiguously decide which animals are OK to eat and which ones aren't using science.
You cannot eat anything which triggers.
Anathema but... observer doesn't mean shit in this.
Anything is an observer.
Anything can collaps waveforms.
I assume that's the joke.
All you need is an interaction.
There's pokemon esports going on the casters are getting enthusiastic about 'the plays'.
They're rolling heatran thundurus m-kangaskhan I'm afraid that doesn't count.
Pokemon esports are a thing ?
20k viewers atm on their 2015 official world championships.
So today our 13th age campaign ended.
At the start of the session we were all like yeah we can do this just fly in and mop what remains of the lich kings and demon lords armies.
About a hour before the end of the session our paladin had become the lich king 2 of our party were still on the way to necropolis our cultist the demon lord and my sorcerer were in a battle.
By the end of the game the lich king killed the demon lord the priest killed the cultist and the cultist exploded again priest died to..I think the demon lord? the fighter killed the paladin lich king I killed the fighter and became the new lich king.
There must always be a lich king.
The best part? This was all player driven.
The cultist wanted the lich kings power the paladin didn't reall want to become the lich king but he never was the brightest guy so we just told him to get in the box. Which is where the conduit for lich kings spirit was.
The demon lord had some sort of grudge and was a NPC anyway my character was carrying the lich kings soul.
Did being the lichking give you any actual advantages ?
Well I was amazing at the job.
But the actual campaign ended the monent I finished what remained of the group.
No i meant for the short periods any of you held it between murdering eachother.
It kind of did yeah.
The paladin got boosts to his smites and such and he was the only one to have the power long enough to get any actual use out of it.
I have regrettably run out of fantasy ww2 we serial backlog.
Stupid body felt ill earlier so had to lie down now it has faded I just feel hungry!?
Hahaha do they expect people to actually buy this?
This has devolved into self parody.
Uh you think that's bad? check out the names for the chaos guys in the age of sigmar starter set.
Welcome to the wonderful world of copyrighted names. Thanks Chapterhouse and GW Legal for such a jolly co-operation.
That cadian has seen some shit.
Which leads to.
And then googly eyes.
That is a lot of skulls to have to indiv paint.
I forgot to put salt and pepper in my scrambled eggs.
What is even the point.
There's a build for you MoonWolf need to keep 6 buffs up to not die.
Anathema why would anyone want that.
He does one of the hardest unique maps in like 5m with it no bother.
Okay thats seems effective.
Thats one beautiful drink.
But I never trust a drink that has more than one colour that comes in a shot glass.
Also wonder what that is...Looks like its something citrus based below the baileys. no idea whats at the bottom.
Might not even be lemon something sour anyway.
You can probably find out the details on reddit.
Otherwise its a DC15 Gather Information or Bardic Knowledge check.
Cooked_Auto was referring to Oglaf I think.
I was just responding before becoming aware of the context.
I think it's fine without one tbh.
A modern reboot of a classic series aimed for the today audience. Now if going to go and wash my mouth for that horrendous sentence.
Goes Forth was a poignant end-end. Back and Forth was a fun diversion. Would be a question of which 'era' to take in a S5.
Dave might no doubt throw money at it like they did Red Dwarf.
That one kinda turned out okay.
Watching Kirby Triple Deluxe again with soothing VO by Medibot.
Kirby just inhaled a boss' health bar out of the bottom of the screen.
Oh no not the pool.
The animest of all the leisure facilities.
That is the pool used in basically ever fucking asian porn movie that features an indoor pool.
Kotaku has an article on that pool.
Or any swimsuit gravure shoot.
That pool is a cultural icon.
Kirby Triple Deluxe spoilers the final boss is an evil space-wasp sorceress.
Who fuses with a giant plant.
This isn't even my final fauna.
Are you sure ?
I told you about the pool man.
...make your opponent's deck their enemy like you're some sort of late 90s Yu-Gi-Oh villain for anyone who doesn't read ChaosSmurf's articles.
This is what you're missing.
È¡€æ§½ xue cao was once the word for the blood groove or fuller on a knife. In the era of fighting games and MMORPGs it became the name for a player's health bar.
In China paintball laser tag etc are called Live action Counter-Strike.
Man getting cs before lazer quazer what a fucked up country.
The pokemon wc has made an all japanese final so the battle screen is entirely japanese the US casters are running guesswork off the graphics.
I think that was flame body activating a burn?
Why is it that the biggest assholes in games dev always sound like villains from a Charles Dickens book? The Odd Gentlemen The Fine Young Capitalists...
Fund my research on patreon.
I dont think phil fish sounds like a charles dickens villain.
Mr Fish kinda does.
More of a comic book villain though I guess.
Maybe even if Mr Kotick sounds too cyberpunk.
Or what was the name of that one indie company that ragequit a while back.
I think they made some sort of walking sim that didnt sell well a month or so back?
Everyone's Gone to the Rapture?
Not that far back.
Tales of Tales is the final entry in a JRPG series.
Final tale of the fantasy tales.
Woe betide anyone who even thinks of making an SSLP of SRHK.
Have fun transcribing all that dialogue.
... you're gonna have to expand out those 8 letters.
I have no idea but I can guess.
Screenshot LP of Shadowrun Hong Kong.
Screenshot lets play o^.
GlennCuddlefish this is why Ray Kurzweil gave us OCR.
Who gave us whatnow?
Cooked_Auto I expected a few things in Transylvania an... alcoholic depressive deer-man not one of them.
Him and Sophie are possibly two of the best NPCs in the game followed by Said and the Proffessors.
Said and one of the Marya's.
Although for that you probably need to get Last train to cairo.
He was pretty fun with just the basic things.
When I hear OCR I think exams board...
Mair He shines in the Last Train to Cairo missions.
Titan Souls is a pretty cool game.
That I will never be able to finish myself.
I am so lost.
He's lost in the pancake.
Pick a hearthstone class.
Mage class challenge it is!
I have the win 7 anything daily and it's at 6/7.
This track's name.
I am not seeing enough lesbians.
Im sure you can fill that void yourself.
Truly evidence that the US has gone to hell.
What's wrong with Psycho-Pass >C.
Pokemon is very serious.
In the end humans were the real pocket monsters.
In the pokÃ©mon world girls must have proper pockets in their clothes.
Or else they'd be denied the monsters for said pockets.
Awwh tgt still a few hours away. c.
Not before 1900 they said.
There's even pirates riding parrots.
Man I am tempted to just take the elevator up and kill everything.
...in this videogame of course.
Well see how it goes in the game first then decide.
According to this thing I'm still rubbish.
You're better than all of us.
Need to be all green.
Anathema I've heard that isn't easy.
Noelor is on form today.
It isn't easy being green anathema.
When talking about weightlifting saying that Kirisu is 'on form' could be considered a pun.
Yeah but i said it so it wasn't one.
Sorry MoonWolf you'll just have to accept you made a pun.
...I don't think that's a pun.
Just the original source of the idiom.
Shush I wanna make MoonWolf feel bad for making a pun.
Trying to make MoonWolf is like wanting to make a river flow upwards.
You know how in gyms they have those adjustable benchs with latches on them so you can lock them in place from vertical to just below horizontal?
Some idiot dropped one of those on his foot today.
I was that idiot.
So hows your foot ?
My cooling pain relief spray has alcohol in it wonder how much I'd need to spray before I'd get a buzz.
Probably more than is in a single can.
Guy gets dumped at ikea for being an idiot ?
Kinda impressed he managed to make jokes out of all the swedish ikea names.
Fantasy finland is a hell of a place.
Well that ikea video completely killed my motivation to draw somehow.
Nah I was struggling already. But now I have an excuse.
Did it not fire you up?
MoonWolf well. This menu is the slowest thing.
Guess TGT is out xD.
MoonWolf ... amaz is opening 400 packs.
MairBear the wrong kind of packs ?
Really hoping for another set of pack misbuys.
Also join me on the mumble.
Right i can't even get into the game.
So concludes TGT evening.
I'm not playing a game with this server lag.
Apparently Target have agreed to remove gender signs from toy aisles...
So HS is just completely down?
The suspects in the PokÃ©mon shooting threat case.
Would you look at that neckbeard.
Yup those are definitely nerds.
Straight out of some kind of comedy sidekick movie.
It's totes fucked up.
Noelor MoonWolf GlennCuddlefish.
And thats shadows run.
I dont think it was quite as good as the previous one.
I mean it was still good but it felt shorter.
MoonWolf I spent all my currency on a unique staff it went well.
That mob in the middle is a boss that died in like 10 seconds.
My ice attack inflicts -82% fire resist onto things it hits.
..Netherlands has royalty named amalia? What are you sadida all of the sudden?
Also another thing that bothers me about shadowrun hong kong is that the video narrator sounds too much like kelly from onion.
Man I should really sleep 'night.
I have started Persona Q.
Koramaru is even cuter.
So I switched the vs ai mode preference from 'adept' to 'beginner' for the lols on heroes.
It goes from compstomp to comp genocide.
Someone invoke the geneva convention on me.
Eh just declare them terrorists and you'll be fine P.
I was not expecting the continued Eevee shirts to be up as early in the week as yesterday.
My PQ party of choice at least to start with Koromaru Mitsuru Aigis Q-exclusive character who uses hand-crossbows.
Oh it's past midnight.
MoonWolf geniune? <- yes.
GlennCuddlefish is the level of my companions a good indicator of my progress through the game?
Its decent. it lags slightly behind but once you run out of levels you should have completed most of sidequests.
Assuming you take all the runs.
I plan on doing all the runs yeah.
When I get around to playing it in between GW2 and PoE >_>.
And PoE when patch 2.0 hits.
Moonwolf BRM Naxx GvG are all valid filters for cards I can't seem to find a working one for TGT though D.
Tgt doesn't work ?
Well in that case see th elittle book left of the search bar.
Oh! I never noticed that thing. THankies.
Have two level 80 characters have yet to see a single exalt drop feel a little better about my drop luck in PoE now.
What was that staff you bought yesterday ?
We still on track to find out how a toffee can be mechanised tomorrow?
MoonWolf I bought that with 3 exalt 1 of which I found after saying I'd buy it then having to be all sorry m8 thought I had 3 only have 2 then within half an hour I found the third.
So pretty happy right now.
Now I'm dirt-poor again.
Someone mentioned CGI Looney Toons.
So now I'm humming Space Jam.
Its a great song.
MoonWolf discussing D3 with a colleague.
He said I play as Nazeebo rather than WD.
Must be a hots player first and foremost.
Well Demon Hunter could be Valla or Illidan.
Incase you missed it.
130407 must be a hots player first and foremost.
And plays D3 on PS.
Servers are getting laggier.
MoonWolf is the new season gonna give me more character slots or do I have to kill off characters? D.
Anathema thought you'd appreciate it.
Thats a little creepy anonymous person on tumblr.
I was being nice.
You mean that's not a compliment!? What about anonymously sending dick picks? Isn't that the height of charming?
No no its not.
The world is so weird with all these rules about what's not classy and what's Indecent exposure.
Its highly complex but i'll trust you'll figure it out MairBear.
MairBear leaving your shutter open for a full second is probably indecent exposure.
Indecent or just suboptimal?
It depends whether or not it's a literal camera shutter I think.
Also known as 'being a male in puberty'.
I would also posit that puberty could be replaced in your sentence with skinny jeans.
But maybe that's just me and my queirdness.
Thats not just you.
Its not a phobia while wearing skinny jeans.
Although my butt is so big regular jeans are basically skinny jeans on me.
That is not an appreciated winky face.
You'll have to pry the bar from my cold dead hands!
Don't skip not-leg day.
Although I have stopped doing squats until my ankles heal.
Stupid frail human body.
I like wearing skinny jeans.
Someone complimented my legs the other week.
You still cycle aye?
I stopped for a bit.
First step down a path that leads to lifting.
The above has some correlation with the amount of time my toenails were purple.
I was imagining some dreadful accident.
Nah I got nail polish a couple months back and did my fingers and toes.
Then obvs had to clean my fingers but really didn't want to also clean my toes.
Confused about how that stopped you cycling.
So I just wore socks around the house and didn't bike in for a while.
Because I have judgement paranoia.
But why would people see your feet?
Context I get changed at the gym if I bike in.
Anyway a couple weeks back I reached the point of wanting to bike/gym more than I wanted pretty toenails.
I doubt anyone in a changing room is going to both notice your toenails and careegotta keep eyes above dong-level p.
But people I work with also gym.
And you know I can't logic my brain out of anxiety/paranoia.
I know i said this before and i knot its not rational.
But considering your hair.
I don't think they'd blink at nails.
My hair's just brown with blonde highlights atm.
Look at you with your full head of hair.
When I move which is a month or two out now.
I'm going to get it bleached and then dyed with pastels of some sort.
Like turquoise and lilac if I can get it light enough.
MairBear remember when we said that atral communion was likely shit but would make great highlights.
First trollden after tgt someone plays a turn 2 ysera with astral communion.
Minister you gonna have a housewarming?
More details when y'know I have a move-in date.
Hogmanay definitely at mine this year.
Yeah I can probably do that.
I'm saying this now as plenty of notice to both of youse.
Will also hit up ChaosSmurf and Gimgim.
If that's a 100% I'll look into travel arrangements since I'll probably be in Glasgow for Christmas.
If i had money i would come chill at your new house so just print a little bit of paper with Moonwolf on it and pretend its me.
Can I print a picture of MoonMoon instead?
But like tape it to a wall at a height above everyone else's head?
MoonWolf flights around december / jan look to be about 80 euro return atm maybe we can do a whipround p.
MoonWolf you like symphonic metal right?
Anathema its pretty good i wish the rest of delains work was too but i can't say that.
Yeah that is the only song I have in my playlists.
Wait the human contradiction is in one too I think.
Somehwo HS is topping the twitch numbers no tournament just people excited about TGT.
The grand tournament the new hearthstone expansion.
Why I love PoE.
Maraunder dual-wielding wand build.
Anathema white march is out now btw.
You'll probably need to go to the eternity.obsidian.net and export your key for steam.
Then import into steam.
I'll get to it after SHHK which I'll get to at the weekend probably.
I'm going to finish the skyrim playthrough first.
And do some d3 on the side.
So it'll be a while.
Yeah but I also need to finish the original campaign too.
I need to replay that due to lost saves.
Also i guess i can see what its like on patch 2.
Hahaha regular Spark fires 3 projectiles at once so LMP isn't great with it.
But Vaal Spark used to fire 1 projectile 150 times so adding LMP or GMP gave you 450 or 750 projectiles.
Don't implement beams as projectile streams.
Is the lesson here.
<- some people here might want this maybe.
Splatunes for them hip squid kids.
MairBear that person is going to hell.
MoonWolf it isn't a beam!
Yay found a helmet with +2 minion gems and + life.
MoonWolf Mukla's hmpion is amazing.
The animation is to just throw a banana when inspired.
Jesus I put a lot on my credit card this month.
Something something jesus saves something something isa.
Good birthday and/or footballs?
There is at least one thing I don't recognise.
Newcastle won 4-1 makes for a decent day.
Well does for me.
Urgh I need to move out or get a housemate or w/e so I'm not broke fucking cambridge.
Hearhtstone opponent had me at 3 hp. Plays acolyte of pain and pings it.
Says well played and mouses over the draw.
Actually has nothing but waits a solid 20 seconds |.
Oh right I've had my contact lenses in over 16 hours that's why I'm starting to feel them.
Eugh definitely can't do maths at this time of night I'm out of shape.
Had me thinking hmm 5am? Dude making us all look bad with that.
Oh man SRHK is throwing missions at me. Loving it.
Cooked_Auto that airport vid seems pretty similar to what I remember from... Toy Story 2?
Some movie I watched had a dramatic scene in the luggage-handling part of an airport.
I'm not sure why that would have happened in Toy Story 2.
But literally cannot think what other movie that scene would make sense for.
Omg I love how into his guitar solo that a capella singer imitating a guitar is.
Ts2 has when woody and the other cowboys are going to a toy museum by plane.
The others launch a rescue but he's already been shipped through.
MoonWolf Two years ago you all voted for the Vector romance as a joke but the joke's on you as it's one of the most heartwarming in the game.
Wait nyt yuru yuris out?
And its subbed in a language I can understand?
...how did I even do that? New yuru yuri's out now. instead of whatever mangling of 2 languages I did there.
That seems pretty good.
MoonWolf gets up early as fuck.
Or are you two hours ahead of Britain atm?
I just get up early to ensure little brothers go to school right.
Think I need to think about losing weight the needle on the scale today was just shy of 90.
Mix of gains and fat without roiding you can only gain about 1kg of muscle a month IIRC but obv you can't meet that without also putting on some fat unless you're already quite overweight.
3 months ago I was 80kg.
But I also got bodyfat callipers and I'm at 24% ideally I'd be 15% but I'll be happy for anythign below 20.
Also last friday I really noticed how tight in the belly area one of my nice shirts was p.
MoonWolf interesting little anecdote about GGG's code / QA.
This is irc not a shell anathema.
Do not fuck with Teddy.
MoonWolf so they removed the necessity for rift stones right?
They now sell for 5000 gold each so that's a nice.
Yes you no longer need regular rift stones.
And you only need a generic greater rift keystone for any level of greater rift.
MairBear Dragon Priest is a pretty legit deck.
You just drop overstatted minions on curve all day.
MoonWolf its one of those days.
Less people would play facehunter if it filled your room with dogs.
Look 1 dog is cute and 5 dogs once might be amazing.
But 500 dogs ?
What are you doing to do with them.
Send them to the face.
Also we got another delivery today that said they couldn't find us yesterday....
Seems every single satnav in the country sends people down the wrong road. And they all give up. Plumbers and the like phone us up for directions at least.
Its fine its not like I wanted to sleep.
Its fine its not like I wanted to sleep.
Not what i wanted at all hexchat.
Stop being so bad at pasting.
I would rather be weak and having had a full nights sleep than a stronk insomniac wreck.
Just do't go full MairBear.
How would I even do that.
Sleeping in too long and then staying awake too late. Or vice versa.
Been there done that. getting old is messing with my ability to do that however.
That was my first horadric cache.
I'm going to wait untill the new season starts.
It's all plans mind. BUt yeah.
Do you guys wanna seasonal stuff this weekend maybe.
Guess I'll see if The Man wants to pay me for it.
I don't think the man would pay you to review a patch.
But you should probably write about this thing.
That does daily news.
That thing annoys me.
Why is that ?
I think we covered it when it launched.
Its a kickstarter for a sequel.
Oh from an is this okay? angle.
ChaosSmurf thats probably something to talk about yeah.
I think originally they said they didn't want to kickstart another game.
And then the fanbase was like you should kickstart another game.
So here we are.
It had only just gone up.
Yeah its like maybe hours old.
By hours i mean literally 2 hours.
I'm not sure when it went up exactly.
I'm sure our news men are on it.
Or I'll get to it tonight.
Its sort of a big deal since its a return to kickstarter for a sequel for one of the Big kickstarter rpgs. that was very succesfull on the market.
Yeah they announced it 2 weeks back though.
So everyone like me thinks we've already written about it.
GlennCuddlefish you up to gaming for tonight or would you rather crash into bed ?
Might be a bit fuzzy but I probably wouldn't be able to sleep that early even if I wanted to.
MoonWolf rather enjoying watching the DOS2 counter tick up.
Seems a bit boring to me.
Thats... going much faster than i expected on a sequel.
I think its faster than the original.
Probably going to see if i can wrangle backing at 25 bucks.
Since it'll be cheaper than buying it.
It is just pre-orders.
And they delivered probably the best K$ game.
Fuck knows why it's worth the 30% to Amazon.
The fans asksed for it and its basically just turning your advertisment campaign into something that makes you money now instead of later.
I'm just surprised that doing it on K$ as opposed to through your own site with exactly the same set up is worth it.
Given the amount they take off the top.
Larian isn't that big.
They probably don't want to deal with that shit.
WHY IS THIS A THING.
It's just a numbers tracker and a link to your bank account though.
I mean I realise it isn't THAT simple.
What's that thing from Star Trek.
The big battle or whatever it was.
That keeps getting used as an analogy.
Closer than I would have guessed.
I've got an email from a Mr.
If you use twitter web.
I would turn off your autoplay video settings.
Because then I would have remembered it.
Is that a thing Twitter fits now.
Because some guy shot two people and then tweeted it.
As well as Facebook.
Apparently he's been suspended so maybe not.
How would that reach my feed.
Nobody did it onto mine though so you might be alright.
I dunno who you follow.
I feel like it'd be your fault.
If anyone on my follows.
Oh yeah the new D3 patch is out as well for those who have missed it.
I would like to be playing it.
But I am not.
This that Virginia thing then?
Yeah the two reporters.
It has made me immensely sad.
Like people I follow with most follows.
Weill you know what CA's like.
He loves a good double homicide.
Huh. I'd seen the reports that they had no clue who the culprit was.
They've probably worked it out now.
Tbf I have no goddamn clue what you're referring to p.
Didn't think oh yeah he'll be a vain git posting it to his acc.
CNN were like we are going to show the clip but only once this hour you might want to step out of the room or switch channel.
That's the clip from the camera man's camera.
Which I also haven't watched.
Well at least it won't be used for an album cover.
Yeah i too wasn't keen on watching live murder.
It hasn't cropped on my feed so.
Then again my feed is you guys some parts gaming news some parts other automated news and humor things and some parts artists and other things.
And the staff of SA.
I see your RTs.
I know how it is.
Eh that falls under other things. And it's only really Lowtax I follow.
Which isn't to say that the Dresden Files are bad books they're quite enjoyable and I enjoy them but I enjoy them in the same way I enjoy pictures of sharks with a faint tinge of worry that one day I might actually come face to face with the creature enmeshed in the entertainment. Hahaha.
Ty btw smurf you prompted me to give my tw web settings a good read through and toggle off the shit stuff they stealth-patched/activated.
I don't stress over it because I still use TweetDeck.
Which is fine though I'd like if it could display gifs.
After all this time.
And I barely use the Android app either and there I've already turned off the autoplay function.
Btw I got asked for my e-mail in regards to both Legion beta and Overwatch beta.
So both maybe closer than thought.
I dunno if that was just a while we're at it type deal attached to the Overwatch one though.
As I'm not expecting it until after Bcon.
Speaking of I haven't read MMOC in a while.
I'm just going to call Blizzcon Bacon from hereafter I think.
I wish someone here liked good games so I had someone to play with.
There's a whole internet of people who don't like popular things out there mate.
Mmoc these days is pretty stagnant.
Yeah but I don#t wanna play with those dicks.
Im sure there is a subreddit or three about it.
BwaS main page is still the main page.
GC tweeted this about game design holinka got flamed ion had to define 'soon' again.
Though I get a good laugh out of the snapshot of the forums at the top.
I am a bit bored of the HOlinka And Lore Get Bullied Show.
There was one /r/wow a week or so back.
Though it looks like someone told them they could say what they like if they want.
So holinka put an npc of himself in the beta with the npc saying go slag me off on tw.
Bet that went down great.
The comments then had aggro against him for making use of the anti-gammongate blocklist.
Well MMOC is a fucking GG hive.
I'm not actually sure why.
MMOs don't really seem like the sort of thing they'd be interested in.
R/wow is as well looking at the up/downvotes on that thread portion.
It's fascinating how bad Blizzard communities get.
Probably the same as others but more obvious.
Omg I can't slag off holinka to his face just because I follow TB and Nero so the system thinks I'm some MRA!
Afaik that's not how it works.
But if you follow TB and Nero you ARE scum.
'Good Game Auto Blocker compares the follower lists for a given set of Twitter accounts. If anyone is found to be following more than one of these accounts they are added to a list and blocked'.
That is a bit of a low bar for correlation on gg-ism.
Depending on how many names are on the list I guess.
Kirisu it's pretty poor.
ChaosSmurf the program or the list?
Unrelated recommend me an Image comic to pick up the first volume of so I can cash in on a 3 for 2 deal at my flcs.
They got Sunstone in stock.
Switch? Which is the same guys new Witchblade book.
Witchblade is on Image?
Or maybe thats Top Cow then.
It was a genuine question.
I can believe it is.
Im looking into it geesh.
Ah ok Sejic's stuff is now Top Cow.
Im just gonna assume you have the Rat Queens books by now since that Image.
Oh yeah got Rat Queens and Saga and Sex Criminals.
Do not fuck with Teddy <- I was expected P4 Teddy for some reason.
I prefer that Teddy over the P4 one p.
MairBear> Also we got another delivery today that said they couldn't find us yesterday.... <- find a locker especially if it's Amazon.
A bunch of local post office/convenience stores have them.
I shall have to look into it though we have just one post office >.>'.
Most of the time the biggest issue whenever deliverymen show up is that they always take the wrong entrance p.
We have two front doors in our house. The most visible one we never ever use.
Are amazon especially bad then? xD.
Mostly because its on the first/ground floor and the cellar entrance is just better with quicker access to the driveway and such.
I have a question about those hearthstone ads.
Why are the players european?
I couldn't begin to awnser this question.
I should probably be able to log into hearthstone now right?
I ended up getting the Grand Tournament pre-order btw.
So highlights of packs over the next X minutes.
I can mumble while you open.
If you care too.
That'd probably be better for everyone else.
I really don't like that pearl.
How is sweden warmer!
Island is bad at staying warm plus gulf stream and what-not.
Gcse geog for me was here's an argos by the m1 why'd they build it there.
And look at these slums on the hills above rio de janeiro.
Oh yeah I dropped geog at 14.
The best one.
Neat. that park was pretty great.
Yeah would be fun to see them use the TSW setting for more that.
Something set in Transylvania or just something as easy as a shooter in the Solomons would be fun.
Noelor my pokemon sprite source.
ONLY ONE OF THEM HAS A MOUTH.
Thats your biggest issue here ?
But it's the first thing I could vocalise.
All these early mornings are giving me terrible burnout...
There is some truth to this.
I see you favouritin' Noelor.
A fantastic picture of him.
It's going on every single feature I write about something he's in.
Cooked_Auto is this reverse-Cenaing.
Is that what's just happened to us.
I waited for it.
An intentional lack of Cena.
That would ahve been so good with john cena.
I posted that one on skype and got pretty much the same answer.
Too many cooks + John Cena mash up?
When does the season actualy go up.
Ten out of ten.
There will be New Year's at mine.
My new flat that I will own.
Mair and Ana will be there.
I'll be asking Gimble when I can work out the smoke signals needed to contact him.
Well this comic's story is certainly going somewhere. no idea where not sure I want to but... yeah.
Huh. Until dawn looks like the best QTE fest david cage-esque game so far.
A recent American study shows that implicit or unconscious biases are now at least as strong across political parties as they are across races.
I'm sorry but.. u wot m8?
Americans are as prejudiced toward political conservatives and liberals as they are toward black/white/Asian/Hispanic/whatever people.
On average based on a recent study.
...Oh somehow I read biases as babies.
That would be have been a very different sentence.
MoonWolf is Frysk Fresian sp?
Why do you ask ?
For no apparent reason.
My work internet connected me to Facebook via the Netherlands.
And it offered you facebook in frysk ?
No it gave me it in Dutch but on the change language bar the options were _.
Nederlands Frysk English US.
I was logging onto Facebook in order to use my fb in place of a new account on a cycle to work website.
That like our business is using to organise cycling initiatives and what have you.
It offered male female neither for gender =.
So now I'm in a good mood for the afternoon.
MoonWolf this arena run is promising. First opponent afk hunter.
Second opponent mage who turn 1 coin her-powered.
I should try some arena tonight.
Either that or see if I can put together a mage deck for ladder.
I guess Inspire or mech?
Activate my week of bonus xp ahead of the bank holiday.
MairBear help me choose o.o.
Hearthstones are where it's at.
Buuuuut the bonus xp is nice and if you're into heroes. Then yeah farm all you can out of it.
Just remember that there's a daily exp cap for AI battles.
So you may fill up for a day D@.
Does switching character bust through it?
Switching to pvp does.
So focus on Lili gotcha.
Are we on a new rotation by now?
Because if we're on a new rotation I'm p sure I'll do at least some HotS.
Tuesday is rotation I think.
I missed my chance to Anub I guess.
TIL shaman makes Mukla's Champion horrific in arena.
Especially if they get taunt totem every time.
Competetive spirit is VERY easy to play around it seems.
Oh you filled your board with tokens?
I guess I'll leave all but this single 1-1 alive.
Yeah I came to the same conclusion myself after my brief foray with it.
You need to play it in a deck with multiple secrets.
So playing around it is awkward.
Matches my initial analysis of it really.
It's hard to not telegraph it though.
Secret paladin isn't really all that though.
I guess it is only 1 mana so a huge swing is not gonna come along too often.
Kirisu maybe one day.
Silver Hand Regent says Well met! when summoned.
This amuses me greatly.
Play one of each of your secrets guy.
Who is in paladin specifically because paladin has cheapest secrets.
The big problem with paladin secrets is.
That they are just not worth the card cost.
The manacost is fine.
But i don't want to spend my cards that fast.
I'm not sure how what you're saying doesn't apply to other 1-drops.
Which do get played.
Yeah but you don't get board presence out of secrets.
I mean I guess?
Secrets in mage are also much more about denial than presence though.
Hunter secrets make attacking incredibly awkward or even impossible.
Mage secrets make doing basically anything a possibly massive mistake.
Paladin secrets tend to make it awkward to trade.
It just doesn't have the same impact.
They were great when the paladin could trigger them activly.
Maintaining presence rather than growing or denying it?
I mean I agree they're lacklustre.
I just... really like the idea of most of them.
I want all classes to have secrets tbh.
Blizzard does not agree.
I really want priest secrets.
Or at least a shadow card to steal secrets.
Shadow Trap 3 Secret when your opponent plays a card it is instead moved to your hand.
When one of your minions would die instead heal it to full?
Seems like its to much like the paladin one.
Paladin is 1 mana bring back at 1hp but otherwise base stats.
Priest is dearer maybe 3 idk prevents death and heals.
Okay. So I kinda threw this deck together.
Meaning it keeps buffs nerfs.
Might have been eaten by the dc.
But yeah 10-1 in arena brag.
I nearly lost a match to that DC too xD.
Is 10 where it stops?
13 is the stops. I didn't get there though c.
Just ran into a mage who just went face and had 3 frost novas a flamestrike and a blizzard.
So I just could not.
And then went into a priest who just had perfect synergy to keep 2 hp ahead of all my things and cleared them all so I couldn't ping.
Well spellslinger gives me mindcontrol. So I'm about to win this one!
Nope. It gave him pyroblast. VVVV.
MoonWolf I have spells in my tavern brawl.
Yeah apparantly it was a bug.
Mairnai please tell me that Spellslinger was vs Priest.
MoonWolf just the only minions part?
Or the brawl in general?
Like if it's still pick a class random deck that's still a bit weak on expansion week.
If you'll pardon my homonyms.
...my dailies in HotS are once more warrior and support.
Aka the only classes I play anyway.
This is not doing a good job of encouraging me to diversify.
Oh rad Gazlowe's on rotation.
And Sgt Hammer! =D.
I'm grabbing some stuff but are you thinking of HotSing?
Only assassin is a level 12 unlock this week.
Mairnai later in the evening.
But wanted to know who's on rotation.
And logged in before thinking hang on there must be a website for this.
And lo and behold.
MoonWolf just the only minions part? <- yes that was the bug.
Not the repeat in general.
Damn noelor/ember ignoring me on mumble.
Did you know that Dihydrogen Monoxide also has PH7 that's higher than any acid! -God Damnit Imgur.
Really good mech card.
<- at that moment samus really wishes she had the ice beam.
MoonWolf I have that one.
I was looking at a deck list and like.
That name doesn't tell me what card it is.
I know I don't have all the cards.
But I'm mostly missing commons.
So just a matter of getting some dust.
Cheap to craft at least.
I'll do arenae I guess.
I didn't think cotton hill was into that sort of thing.
Magical tea of +1 bosom.
Magical tea of +1 bosom <- those were not +1's.
My feet hurt have not walked this far in a while and never in these shoes.
Maybe you should do some more treadmill time.
My ankles are stir messed up or i would be running weekly p.
MoonWolf what is a 1 in the EGSverse though.
More than i what i think is a 1 apparantly.
What is the smallest integer value of breast growth.
That looks about right in context of EGS.
EGS doesn't have much granularity.
Seems like a suboptimal scale.
Because larger would be super.
2 hours hype! And only 8 till playable!
Or wait... one hour? EST not GMT?
Why did MGSV Conflict of Interest have to strike on D3 weekend c.
Becaues japan does not care about d3.
I'll choose to blame blizzard for it.
Did he cause delays cos they didn't build him a fully functional Metal Gear again?
Yes he didn't feed the construction crew so the invasion was delayed.
Ah wget you so lovely downloading 68gb site for me overnight <3.
Dob ping me if/when you wanna HotS.
Ah right. sorting food atm so may be in like an hour or something.
Np hearthing stones meanwhile.
The UK House of Lords is also larger than the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea 687 members. hehe.
Not a good statistic.
Sorry I thought that said DPRK's army.
I mean 687 is still an awful number for our house but.
Yeah commons is a nice round 650.
Your trial has ended and you will not be able to mix down.... okey.. I'll just save it as a lossless format and convert it later...
MairBear I discovered I really like playing Kerrigan.
So now I'm playing Countess Kerrigan all night.
Watching umaru-chan with cola in the fridge is proving to be difficult.
Ah yes that one.
Have heard of that.
Facing a lot of paladins on ladder or...?
Noelor it is from amethysts perspective.
Writing about the Guild Wars 2 expansion.
It's making me really excited for Legion v.
Just because GW2 has a terrible expansion doesnt mean wows will be good.
MoonWolf okay so I can't change my persona.
But I can summon a second one!
Awesome. if I was a man who wears fancy shirts I would order some.
Instead you are a fish.
And a slobby fish at that.
Not technically a fish.
Less of your fishlip.
No you listen smurf.
Have you heard this 8-bit Maiden song btw.
Cuttlefish are a part of the cephalopoda not vertebrates like fish.
As far as the NES sound chip goes I have heard better rock songs.
Or maybe I am just too tired for this now.
Will have to listen to it again in the morning.
Not in FINAL JUDGEMENT MODE.
Fuck this interview by the way.
The ArenaNet guys can't fucking type.
Or it went through some sort of auto-PR filter.
So it all reads really fucking stilted.
And also it's quarter to one in the morning and I'm working on it meaning I hate it.
Auto-PR filter sounds like something that adds at the end of every sentence while removing half of the words at random.
And the word content to replace them.
Stab em stab em all with a rusty fork.
They are sadly in Seattle I think.
And I don't have that big of a fork.
Wts P3 Aeon isn't an arcana.
That's why everyone's awake.
Well not anym ore.
Yay it's friday fuck being original.
Are you okay Kaun.
Father! I've told you about training people without their consent!
The chronicles mode in this game is serious business.
And now nobunaga is in drag.
Aaa now I remember what was lacking in yesterdays dinner.
Well you fucked up.
So yeah....You keep doing that I'll go...that way...
<- if that was 10 times longer it would be a realistic bushido blade match.
Care for a bronze statue worth $1800?
The Revenue're sending me a cheque for overpaid tax.
I'll give you 20e for that statue.
Noelor sweet free money.
I'm a pizza dinosaur.
All tomato and cheese.
Doesn't look like pizza to me.
Looks more like pizza than all other dinosaurs.
Ok so here's the deal with personas in Q.
Everyone including protagonists has a fixed persona.
But everyone including navigators gets a secondary persona they can switch about.
Meaning I have elements all over my party which is actually pretty nice.
What I don't know is if/when social links show up.
They might just not.
Is the secondary persona also fixed.
Or is everyone now half fool ?
Also i am hanging out on mumble should anyone care.
Everyone's been given pseudo-fool powers.
And my fool powers have been downgraded.
Right now I'm a fool/strength junpei's a magician/hermit I think etc.
MoonWolf seems my PoE KS doesn't include the expansion.
Steam downloads thingie shows disk activity now as well sweet.
Oh hey I didnt know stein's gate had a PS3 release.
Is the VN as overloaded with cicadas and a bleached-out colour palette as the anime?
I see 4chan has been busy trolling tumblr again.
I dont know its going to download for another x hours.
Well it might download quicker if I actually forced it to download instead of just idling in the queue.
Trying magners' take on a kopparberg type cider construct tonight.
Strongest fruit texture I've had since ribena.
Thats a lot of fruit.
It's quite the kick like the alt red bull cranberry edition level.
MoonWolf ->.
So far my theory on the plot of steins gate The MC is a moron.
Yeah he's kinda a cunt.
Also is this one of those waifu games.
A lot of waifu material in this intro.
Yeah the VN is very waifu game.
Anime itself less so. The rotation through the 'harem' has a bit more storyline attachment rather than oh don't wanna date you moving on to next girl.
Mmm what you saaaay.
Stealth inc 2 free on humble bundle.
So they're playing an int'l hots invitational tourney over at pax right now.
Leading to 2nd best NA team beating the best EU team for the third-place play-off.
First time the scene has been able to decide which region is on top.
At this point I am certain the MC is an idiot.
Wait thats a guy?
Goddamnit japan thats twice today!
He's a slacker of a university student allegedly on a science degree skiving his lectures and misuses his finances yep.
Also yes daga otoko da.
Okay that inner monologue was pretty gold.
Since I presume it's that scene.
Okay look I can believe that was a guy but I am not going to believe this girl is 12.
Welp guess that wasn't the 12 year old then.
Wait 12 yo? this mayuri fehris kurisu?
None of the above I think. the CRT shops owners daughter is 12 and this other girl busted in in the middle of that conversation.
Ah right that one second one the part-timer sounds like think she's older.
I have entered some kind of catgirl cafÃ©.
I think this is the universe telling me that its time to stop.
The Organisation wants that.
Final outcome of that hots thing had the south korean team beat the top NA team in 'straight sets'.
Sets up interesting blizzcon series.
MoonWolf any idea what the butcher's cleaver actually does?
Oh it's just cosmetic.
It just makes noises.
Summon WD seems really fun.
But I am not using two of my trees at all.
And instead have 3 secondary abilities.
+ spiders dogs big lad.
Get yourself some fetishes.
So far in steins gate I dont hate anybody but the main character.
Apparently large hadron collider is moe.
A DC35 Knowledge check at level 2. wts Age of Worms. What the shit.
That's a lot of rules and text for an elevator.
Hmmm something is wrong here.
Making rangers kill themselves with a reflect missle wall is fun.
Goddamnit MC stop making Mayuri cry.
I am not sure I can actually finish this thing the MC is getting on my nerves too much.
Which is a pity because everything else seems good.
Success landlords visited said I have kept house very clean.
Man I see a lot of legwork in the future of this game.
Hm 1 out of 3 auctions won is a win I guess.
Western female design.webm.
Speaking of female design time to try lollipop chainsaw.
How would you like to open this pdf? Through Adobe Reader as before or through IE... I mean Spartan... I mean Edge!
Sweet the auction got even cheaper because the guy had miscalculated on the site >.
Go away shark you're too fat.
Corrupted blood springs to mind from such a headline.
Hmm lovin' these company application diversity questionnaires.
Religion.
Sexual orientation.
That is not an orientation.
This certainly is a suda game.
Actually I dont think had that much to do that Lollipop Chainsaw.
How is that battletech LP.
Have they not finished.
Come to some sort of logical end.
Its a long campaign.
It's been like 6 years.
Funny enough that thread has I think given PTN a writing job at CGL for Battletech stuff. At least I recall as much.
No idea if its passed an old Planescape SSLP in age by now or not.
Great thing about this job hunting life is I'm finding out the fucked up names of all these places down south.
TIL there is a settlement known as Ashby de la Zouch.
Oh the joys of having a brit STing a bunch of Americans and Canadians in Changeling. Just because the ST tends to throw in really british words and terms that confuse the hell out of the others.
MoonWolf I got RoRG suddenly farming T7 like it's no thang.
I can still kill all the things before you finish landing though.
Sadly it's mostly the hammer that kills thing.
The swords hurt but the hammer is more damage. Just harder to hit and no DoT after-effect.
Omg it froze on zoning again...
Good news guys gwent is an esport now.
Hexchat displayed the first one as Mu so I didn't think it'd give me notes.
Just lost to mill rogue.
Sure is a deck full of dicks.
You brits having a bank holiday ?
Light rain my ass. This is British rain p.
Well thats one hell of a description of rain.
Well its pissing down outside that's what it is doing.
Its raining so hard now that I took pity on my mom who biked to work that I told her sister to ask her if she needed a pickup instead. P.
So much pity I asked someone else to give her a lift!
The best son =3.
Well I don't have a drivers license so vOv.
And her sister is down visiting us.
According to the facebook news ticker.
Kanye West will run for president in 2019-20.
But should he really have all that power?
Aw yis expanded Witcher 3 soundtrack found.
Cooked_Auto no one man should tbh.
So in this stage of suda51 does too many drugs I am fighting a psychedelic zombie chick.
I think its more a case of suda51 doesn't take any drugs but really should take some.
Oh god its arodable.
Man that was annoying.
I had to kill her 15 times.
GlennCuttlefish thats a lot of times.
She kept splitting herself like some kind of undead amoeba.
I've boujght at least 40 shoulders off kadala today all yellow.....
Thats kadala for you.
What's kadala? some miniatures site?
Diablo 3 vendor for gambeling.
Its raining cats and dogs here.
Stopped raining here now.
Should probably just tweet that.
I take back what I said it's back to pissing down outside.
Well I wasn't going to buy SF V.
This is ana amzing thread.
Also for a second I thought there was 2 headed sheep in the background.
Who even is that lady.
Kinda like the hairstyle that comes with that outfit.
Oh wait those are pre-order costumes from specific shops? order cancelled torrent stopped futuretro actively broke the disc.
Since both milk and orange juice are things you drink at breakfast I should be able to substitute orange juice for milk into the recipe bahaha.
Well i'm going to sit on mumble anyway in the hope MairBear wakes up.
I'm doing exalted tonight or I'd join you.
That games seems to very intermittant.
Also i should just be honest with myself and adjust this now.
We started a fight last week.
Too diablo to 13A?
Because there is no way i'm actually going to pull through and do prep on TGAO.
And i have nothing worked out already.
I set a pan on fire with just an electric stove coil and a half teaspoon of butter. Then I posted pictures on here. I still have that pan. I think I ignited it again too since then. HOW.
Also is there just a public singing thread or w/e on /with sound gifs/?
Comic Neil DeGrasse Tyson is tired of your shit.
What a tiny bacon.
Alt Cammy looks rad.
So I just pulled off an Overwatch overkill in SRHK D.
I did not know that was a thing.
You've never had 3+ activate overwatch on something that steps through a doorway in XCOM and just instantly killing it? p.
Cooked_Auto I bought vol 1-3 of Sunstone today.
Flcs did not have Switch.
I need to order vol 3.
Had vol2 of uh...
I can neither pronounce nor spell his name.
They had Witchblade stuff from other authors.
Is the title I was looking for.
Zombies love human face. Its their favorite part.
So zombies are like llamas I guess.
This is the only reply I can give to that.
I guess the morale of this story is that you shouldn't bully sad goths.
What about happy ones?
MoonWolf opened my season reward box.
I got a golden freezing trap and golden fel cannon V.
Also golden Young Priestess but she's actually good.
I don't suppose either of you are going to play any hearthstone this week?
I have the spectator quest.
I'm gonna keep my dailies in check.
I'll not delete it then.
Can't play HS right now cos waiting on another installation or update.
'Waiting for' it means.
Listening to an intro to my upcoming OU course on creative writing.
Apparently there will be points at which I have to check fellow students' work and give them mine in return.
Oh Noelor correction it's in about 2 weeks that I'll be up in newcastle.
I have attacked a mage's face killed her minion summoned a minion cast a spell.
*and she still has a secret up.
Summoned Majordomo Executus when I had lethal.
I had much more than 9HP left and a number of taunts.
MairBear so long as you let me know an actual date that'll be fine.
I won't be in my new flat until October.
MoonWolf druid deck vs me playing dragonlock.
Turn 4 astral communion turn 5 dalaran aspirant.
Turn 6 innervate concede.
That h was annoying me.
MoonWolf I was a little incorrect.
I've been in an hour and a half this morning.
And spent an hour of that looking at and fixing my old code.
Past-me was so bad at this.
Past you is always bad at this.
It does not matter how good past you thought he was he was always horrible.
Past me even used male pronouns what a dweeb.
With the announcement of the next D3 expansion at Blizzcon this image will finally be irrelevant.
Except for asking what SC2 Phoenix is/was.
We will be freed from the 5 year old heavily out of date release thing.
I'm referecing it in something I'm writing so it's at the top of my mind again.
If I ever get to sit down with someone who might know I might ask them about different bits of it.
Probably get a bunch of no comments.
ChaosSmurf how's the timeline for Phoenix becoming HotS?
The revival of RTS?
That's the first expansion for SC2.
Don't think there are any expansions yet mate.
You have flip turned this around on me in the most devastating manner possible.
They've not finished releasing the base game in three boxes.
Yeah phone keyboard made that way slower than it needed to be.
SC2 is the hobbit movies of gaming.
I dont know at least the hobbit movies were fun at times.
MoonWolf the latest EGSNPs have appeared in glorious colour and hd on Dan's Patreon.
You know in case that's something you needed.
Now that is one dapper fellow.
Minister not exactly something i needed.
Also that drink appears to have effects on lothing in men.
Didn't seem to do that in women.
Much less pronounced on Dan's dress but yeah.
Ooh 6FU are doing Nobilis soon.
I have to reset my PC at about this time every day.
Or it slows down to the point of unusability.
Its a shit pc.
Or you use some custom software for your job that is shit.
One or the other possibly both.
Welp know what I'm doing tonight.
Echopraxia is a strange novel I think I prefer blindsight.
I have 13 True Ways on my phone but not the 13th Age book.
So I can't check wizard spells.
Your phone can't dropbox ?
Yeah but it's a big download.
And not really worth the time just to check the feats on Haste.
What is this about ?
I just could have sworn there was a feat or level bonus to cast Haste at multiple targets or affect self also or something.
But I'm listening to the latest 6FU and their wizard is just who wants it and chooses one target so I'm probs wrong.
Or it is a feat she no longer has.
Haste does not even have any feats at all.
So I'm just wrong cool.
Good thing I'm not a wizard!
Meanwhile in the SA thread for Ex3 Nobilis put forward as ideal system for a MtG RPG.
Not even joking here.
I was digging through my books last night looking for one with lines and plenty of space to do uni work in this year.
Found one with RPG stuff there are two or three Nobilis characters that never got played.
Probably for the same games!
Also a couple Infernal exalted because obvs.
And notes from our Dresden story!
That is one fat shark.
Just a really large great white.
Those are some fucking striking eyes.
Just rub a marginally sub-lethal amount of glitter on yourself and even you could look this fabulous.
So today we 1 got the doctor game to work Well wii games in general and watched the second season of steven universe.
And I came to the conclusion that my friends have terrible tastes in fusions.
Did they try and fuse with each other?
They just prefer sugilite over sardonyx.
Also it occurred to me that the world lacks a Rules of Na- JOHN CENA mash up.
...how do you... no.
They are very wrong people.
First spoiler-free impressions of MGSV What the Shit Kojima.
I could have given you that impression without playing the game.
Did you believe his lies mair.
I didn't know he lied.
Well he did buy a ticket to the ruse cruise.
I need to know what he lied about.
Also if you can climb that mountain.
You could in witcher. It was usually not worth it but there was only one mountain I failed to climb.
And that was because it was walled off with invisible walls due to plot.
Also fun times going into that place because for what ever reason it was populated by respawning vampires.
Wet hot american summer has a lot of great actors but there is no way I an buy that they are playing 17 year olds.
ChaosSmurf Kingdom Death Monster has started shipping.
H. Jon Benjamin and Amy Poehler are in it though so I can forgive a lot.
2 episodes in it is kinda shit what a waste.
I agree with Glenn and Mair re fusions.
Though Garnet and Opal are better than either Garnet/Whoever fusion.
But opal is better than sugilite.
All the tristram tabs I can find are awful.
Wtf Jon Hamm is in this too.
Cooked_Auto have a link for this YouTube reacts MGSV vid?
Dont watch that stuff.
GlennCuddlefish if I'm honest it's as much about the ship for me as the actual fusion.
!note Noelor.
Fair enough I havent really thought of shipping in that show. Well besides thinking rose and greg made a great pair. Also I like pearls obsessive devotion to rose.
! note Noelor.
GlennCuddlefish these are both valid opinions.
Oh and the weird theory that greg never owned a cat. Amethyst was just being weird.
She always says she'll be the cat/crocodile.
Wtf with this cast.
Well yes but greg propably didn't know that.
Just tried reading this head hurting from all the artsy fartsy.
Boss there's no time for recreational hunting.. focus on the mission. - Ocelot when I accidentally rammed a sheep with a van. V.
Mairnai ocelot best lot.
You are in fact the baddies ocelot.
I'd never found Captain Haile's house in Act 5. That was the cutest thing.
Proving in other ways that Haile truly is the most badass Heroic Mortal.
Yeah that guy is amazing.
They should give him a set.
Or maybe a new class.
Next expansion play The Captain.
Yell at your allies to buff them.
Mairnai remember my thing about demon hunters having melee weapon animations and fucking nothing to do in melee ?
Apparantly they are getting a melee set.
Thats not a sniper rifle.
Tried to name my HC DH GloriaGaynor Of course Gay is censored.
Thats an anti material rifle.
She was the one who sang I will survive.
RulesONature made it to level 4 before I ran into an unfortunate event.
I'm guessing whirlwind Barb?
Nah DH. But my previous witty name was denied. So I just winged it.
Unrelated I played Unknown Armies last night.
Seems aight but it was a pretty poor pre-written one-shot.
Mairnai it's like a conspiracy theory occultism modern setting.
In which the PCs are terrible people.
Like I think we had... A washed-up political speech writer with nothing to lose a judo master who got shot in the face a nurse with a chip on his shoulder and... Someone's mom.
Just someones mom ?
Either she or her son may have been an author?
Apparently she could enter a berserker mom-rage if anyone threatened her child.
Coffee more boring than tea.
Coffee Still better than tea.
But specifically in EGS-verse it has no adverse effect.
S'a matter of perspective.
Iroh still my spirit old-man.
Iroh is the best.
Great now even they are doing it.
I knew there was something better than fultoning sheep. I knew it. MGSV related so levels of spoiler might vary.
Is it the horse gif MoonWolf linked yesterday?
Well I certainly did not expect a Shadowrun joke in today's QC.
My facebook hasn't updated for several hours. So all morning after not enough sleep I find myself staring at this.
Ooh Zagara in the HotS rotation this week.
And then a bunch of nobodies.
Kirisu Man morbi loves tormenting shippers.
Are there even ships.
This is the internet.
Of course there are ships.
Like you put 2 or more females into one room on the internet and you will get ships.
Actually no make that 2 living beings.
..actually no make that 2 sentient things.
What is the best terran theme from the original StarCraft?
Just terran 1 ?
Are you asking a question in response to my question?
Excuse me for Scribblin'?
Teaspoons are running out very early in the day this week.
Can't tell if this is literal spoons or metaphorical spoons.
They are very different.
There is no spoon like you didn't see that one coming.
..actually no make that 2 sentient things <- make that 1 thing and 1 thing capabable of having sex in some fashion.
Like if I was going to ever order something like that that would be the one.
Also you know its not available any more.
So glad I'm moving out soon.
Parents have been in my room today without any level of warning or permission.
You’ve heard of Gravity Falls now get ready for Steven Falls Over.
Noelor i'll take any steven universe at this point.
So i have found the most hilarious and utterly NSFW podcast.
If abortion is an unacceptable outcome for your genes then I’d probably suggest that casual sex might not be for you. waaaay too reasonable.
...the amount of time it takes the commentators to notice.
Shaman win daily in hearthstone.
Time to see if my dream of a totem deck is a reality!
Inspire happens after all other effects of the hero power are complete right?
Mukla's Champion might work out then.
Ok after a couple games I need more minions with actual stats in this deck.
Omg guy who I get guitar lessons with other pupil not the teacher said he'd be here today in the email 2 weeks ago today he is late so I text him hi I'm still on holiday back next week.
Why even bother having different stats in D3.
A very good question they don't have an awnser too.
Considering how a wizard literally never wants anything but Vit and Int just wrap Int Dex and Str into 'damage'.
It could literally be replaced by do damage and health.
Stop pretending your game has nuance.
And fix the fucking tooltips too.
Amateur hour over here from Blizzard.
What do you want to change about them ?
Have them actually be accurate?
Do you not have show advanced tooltips on ?
My archon tooltip still lists 100 seconds as the cooldown which is wrong.
Cooldowns are fucked on tooltips.
The damage reduction on my frost armour is wrong too.
They probably need to rewrite the whole tootip system.
It was never designed to deal with the way items work now.
They are simple strings with numbers plugged in from selected runes.
Datafarmers know about skill changes because blizzard changes the tooltips manually.
So they know when a small numeric nerf takes place that should technically only be server side.
This is the exact same problem wow had with buff tooltips 10 years ago.
And they didn't think maybe create an architecture wihout that for their new game?
No because the way they had item designs for their new game they didn't need to.
So they made a simple string system for their new game.
I keep smashing my face against aggro decks with perfect draws for turns 0-4.
Which was much simpler than an overdsigned dynamic system.
And now its probably not a priority right now to fix it.
Because there is 15 new exciting features people in charge would rather have them build.
MoonWolf this is what I get for early-season laddering.
But I cba to work out this week's brawl.
It seems like a fun one!
Increasingly i feel like the star loss from season changes should be much lower.
So there is more tiering when starting again.
I think it's pegged around taking X seasons of inactivity to get back down to Angry Chicken?
MoonWolf you can't honestly say that they never planned to haveitems that affect your abilities can you? I mean I know D3 on release was boring but not /that/ boring p.
I can say that.
Only two patches in did they even introduce +20% damage to basic ability affixes.
I just learned that Tuskarr Totemic can summon totems you already have summoned.
Can it summon totems that aren't the core 4?
I feel like I haven't seen any yet.
It can even summon totem golem.
Weighted toward core 4 though I guess?
No clue if there is any weighting.
That would not be in line with the other summon random x thing abilities though.
Oh nice got a Mana Tide out of him.
Turn 6 Ironbark Protector oh no!
Hahaha he actually conceded in response to that.
Gah I should have looked at my opponent before deciding to mulligan.
And not kept Dust Devil vs mage.
Oh cool she's mech.
Oh I just double-Overloaded because I'm a retard garbage baby.
Maybe not play hs more tonight.
Noelor 15th to 20th is when we'll be in da hood.
Any chance of watching you play HS?
MoonWolf said I'm not allowed to play my own games any more =P.
BUt yeah heading to HS.
I'm full of salt tonight because of meatspace stuff.
MoonWolf turn 3 mindgames paladin.
Oh hey the SU hiatus might be over next week.
Seems I caught up at a fortunate time.
Pretty done with that hiatus.
They'll do another Steven Bomb.
And then pause until 2016.
As a fan of gravity falls I wouldn't even notice.
Noelor>> oh what's up?
I swear to gods that dog is messing with me.
So I have to visit the toilet right but the hallway is dark. Because of this I take extra care to check that the dog is not parked in front of the wc door. Again.
Well he's not. Fine open door go in.
Then I hear this silent sound and when I try opening the door the door jams...
Hello darkness my old friend.
!note anathema Firefly is just a shittier Outlaw Star.
Firefly bashing? oh man that's my jam!
Ana likes both those things is the deal.
Yes was everything I expected.
Good night irc people.
...what the hell was I doing last night.
Why do I have an amazon tab for unicycles open.
How many did you order?
Oh yeah MoonWolf I will not be here for the 15th.
Also going out on a limb with this one but did the place you got the NPC pogs for the character choices come with square-ones or uncropped ones?
She Blinded Me With Science has now been set as your helicopter's arrival music. YAAAAS.
Doing some more preparatory writing exercises for uni.
This morning I had to wrote about somewhere from memory without worrying about accuracy.
So I wrote about my grandmother's old kitchen.
My grandmother's kitchen used to have tall metal stools.
And the stools had little steps so children could sit on them that flipped over into the space between the legs.
And after I'd finished writing about those stools I was like that sounds completely made up.
But I checked with mum and apparently they were real.
Cooked_Auto the same actress too?
BBC One announced today that Alex Kingston will return to Cardiff to reclaim her role as Professor River Song for the highly-anticipated 2015 Doctor Who Christmas special.
Highly anticipated my arse.
Have they even had a new season this year?
My best friend recently gave an update on a DD game she's playing. Her friend playing a druid was confronted with a fire elemental and wanted to summon an animal to help. She summoned Smokey the Bear.
An update Smokey the Bear worked. The bear takes fire damage. But does the fire take bear damage?
That reminds me of one of my favorite reoccurring thing from a game of 13th Age. One of the players was playing a nature themed sorcerer and he reskinned burning hands to be firing bees at things. This led to the constant question from the party Are they weak to bees?
Medibot plays a sorcerer in 6FU's 13A LP.
He has dealt damage of such elements as candy bad ideas mad that I'm drinking his milk and the invention of lightning.
Yes its DYING.
They got rid of Dancey.
That or he bailed.
Surely i have ranted about pathfinder online before when you were present ?
Didn't recognize the url.
Oh goblinworks is the company setup to actually do it.
Ryan Dancey is a mmo developer who is shit. He's responsible for the inception and development of Pathfinder Online.
Yeah that was my next question too.
Well he's a tabletop game designer.
That tried to move into mmo development through ccp but got fire.
Then moved onto pathfinder online.
Hopefully nobody in the technology sector will hire him ever again.
He's also partially responsible for the OGL.
What they mean by that is trying to sell the world and a small hardcore fanbase a product they cannot realistically make and living off of crowdfunding to do it.
They are down to 3 employees?
Yeah its just enough people to maintain the servers.
Untill money runs out.
In the hope that they can find a corporate backer.
Tis will never happen and i don't believe for a moment they think that will happen.
Its just easier to say than hard shutting it down right now.
Its a shame it is almost impossible to make a good MMO.
Yes but on th eother hand if you are going to try to make an mmo maybe don't try to sell the world what Dancey was trying to sell it.
Oh I was just speaking generally not about Pathfinder Online I don't care about that.
Was actually thinking back to Vanguard again.
And GW2 / WoW.
I mean they're better than the biggest massively multiplayer game.
I apologize for nothing.
MoonWolf to go back a little.
Medibot is a fantastic roleplayer of Weird characters.
Audible basically the only acceptable interstitial ads because they are required by Amazon to turn into book recommendations.
Anyway Medibot's other characters include a goblin with Waluigi's voice a tv chat show presenter in a kaiju-fighting game and Dr Hexagon.
Anathema as I was leaving the cafe for lunch Sky News were interviewing Ken Livingstone about Corbyn and according to the subtitles he said he'd be a very consensual leader.
Using cliche characters can give your prose a semblance of humour and quickness but your story featuring them will have about as much chance of winning a contest as a prefab apartment in a competition of architects.
Even more damaging you will sound like a bigot.
Who's been to Poland.
What do I need in Poland.
What is the currency of Poland.
I'm going to Poland.
Wait no let me do them in order.
Me and more recently Dob.
Me Dreary Clothes Zloty have fun.
I say cheap s'relative - I'd just been in Berlin.
Well it's inland continental climate.
Granted the reason I even was in Poland was for a school trip to Auschwitz which might have made things even drearier but I have a distinct memory of lots of grey concrete.
Oh Dob is here.
September it won't be freezing just yet you get warm summers.
Cooked_Auto>> funnily enough that was practically the reason I was in Poland too.
I went in February because it was the first week WoW was out over here vanilla even.
Cant remember when I went over there probably around spring because the weather was decent.
Yeah Auschwitz is going to be the reason anyone goes to Poland if they went as a teen.
Well they hosted the Euros a few yrs back with Ukraine.
...the only good reason then.
And then there's europa league games.
CS Other notes whatever you might have heard kurwa is not a word that they throw out constantly. Also pickled cucumber might be prevalent p.
I remember they did very good apple pies in that country.
Also dovhiezenya it's probably not spelled that way but that was good evening I think.
Isn't that Russian? Â´_ã‚`.
Could just be generally Slavic I suppose.
Ah right Newgle Translate to the rescue.
Goodbye -> Do widzenia.
Alright none of that was useful.
Do they have different plugs over there.
And is it actually the zloty because I was assuming it was the euro.
Well that's saved me some embarassment.
Eu plugs should do you iirc.
Can I buy a thing.
That will turn my plug into their plug.
Aight I will go via a place that does those things when I come home tomorrow.
You would need a Type G to a Type E converter.
Do they all speak english.
The older they are the less likely that might be.
Should be alright then.
But seeing as I assume this is for work related purposes I would say yes.
I leave in a week.
Then yes there will be plenty of english spekaers there.
I'd be worried if that wasnt the case.
Especially if the venue is international.
Toilet signs are different they're.
Remind me when I log in at home.
Because it's triangles and circles and I can't remember which shape means penis.
Unrelated the writing exercise following that discussion of cliches was to write a scene in which I presented a cliche character and then made them more complex.
How'd that work out ?
So I wrote a short scene about a football hooligan singing Cruel Angel's Thesis.
Which was dumb because now I have Cruel Angel's Thesis stuck in my head.
Hmm could develop that for a discussion of the manic depressive state of Borussia Dortmund midfielder Shinji Kagawa.
I already accidentally wrote the intro to a cool supernatural noir story I want to see more of yesterday.
Fair warning I sound nothing like a anthropomorphic girl squirrel. Thanks for the heads up Dan.
I have totally missed that MVGroup has started posting torrents to TPB again. Sweet jesus so many documentaries to download.
Database maintenance please check back in 10 minutes. Damn you. Oh well. Time to collect the torrents.
I really dont regret getting a 2tb drive for media.
ChaosSmurf if you go to the toilet in Poland you will want a triangle door.
And NOT a circle.
Because men are pointy ?
I think it's usually a downward-pointing triangle if that helps you parse the symbology.
4X is great.
Noelor the cutest post.
This had better be a really fucking cute post.
Yeah that was pretty darn cute =3.
MairBear MoonWolf prefers Brightwing to Lili.
How wrong is he?
Well MoonWolf is inherently evil so it's no surprise.
Hmm well at least he doesn't think a solo support should be tyrande/tass.
BW does allow more targeted healing.
MairBear i like teleporting okay.
BwaS Tyrande is a fine support fight me.
As a solo healer I don't think so.
Some anime vlogger I follow has recently moved to japan and is now clearly living the life.
Dont worry crushing reality will set in sooner or later.
God damn it. Get a druid who plays slow as balls down to guarenteed lethal watch him take all day to finish his turn. Then Disconnect.
Dob Sgt Doomhammer though.
I'm not so keen.
Her ult is an Iron Star.
Her spider mines are tiny Iron Stars in barrels.
The voice acting is just reg hammer modulated and sounds out of place for an orc.
Most hammer play goes for napalm anyhow bfg is quite the cd and I don't think the numbers are as good as say hinterlands blast.
Orbital at 20 does allow one spin where you aim for the core and it will impose some form of 'time limit' on the game.
I dunno I have to be enthused by a character and an orc with pigtails or giving hammer green skin and tusks isn't my jam.
Orc with pigtails falls within the category of my jam.
That is all sorts of my jam.
Marathoned out the rest of Sidonia S2 only just noticed the timeow.
LOADING BATTLE FLOPPY!
Erm yah CA we've all been playin' it.
What did everybody actually go back to wow?
I logged on to clear mail and fly.
Then remembered I hate the game.
Like hell I'm ever touching a monthly fee or most MMO nowadays p.
Aw yis The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo from 2015 video >.
Make a brawl deck of nothing but 1-2 costs cos I want to clear quest but cba to play HS.
I'm guessing but I think what just happened was my opponent figured it out and so he just wasted time roping me.
Like... I'm not even thinking I'm just slapping things down and ending my turn why he gotta do that D.
I had 'good' sleep restoration according to my band for the first time in ages last night.
Anathema i think your mumble is down.
Mumbleboxes.com seems down too.
Anathema that'll do it.
Shouting and Firebending intensifies.
Man I feel energetic today.
Aw yis another chapter of Dungeon Meshi translated.
Having the firstworldest of problems lately.
In that the knowledge of how soon I'll be moving out again is amplifying all the little annoying things about living with my parents.
Minister Have some SU then. Or maybe that should be SUAU.
Like the fact I can't have a shower that doesn't turn into ice water and/or steam midway through unless I get in around 6.
I am almost curious what this stageshow looked like.
America has gone too far.
Doesnt even have to the US.
Not enough bacon or grease.
It probably is though.
Like using churros instead of flakes.
Minister OTOH you'll have to clean your own bathroom and do your own dusting.
I'm getting a ground floor flat.
That means I can get a roomba!
America has gone too far <- lol.
The Great Satan has done it again.
Someone called their company that.
<- I need this in my life right now.
Kirisu you tried your bertrand yet?
Anathema I haven't had time/arsedness to work it out yet.
Probs the weekend for next week.
All FF7 abridged made me think is this They are trying WAY too hard to make everything funny. I...don't think they know what they're doing.
Not that I've seen it but.
Sounds right for what I know of the people responsible.
Being a posh school my high school has an alumni association.
And I get emails from it telling me what is up at my old school and of chances to attend reunions.
Today I am informed of a drinks reception in London.
The email for which finishes with don't forget to bring your business card for a chance to win a bottle of wine!
You are so middle-class.
I don't have a business card!
Yeah but you should.
My school just expects me to because of how middle class my parents are.
You are letting your parents down by not having a card.
Anyway no I'm not going to London to buy drinks.
Wait you'd have to pay for the drinks?
First drink is free.
Plus the chance for a bottle with a business card.
You could also visit me 3.
This is also due to happen around the time I'm likely to move into the new flat.
If everything proceeds on its current course.
Today I discovered that the Marvel Legendary DCG is really fun.
Also I linked the first episode of that last night. Seemed okay.
The FF7 TAS thing.
Minister you don't need to provide a legit reason to not go to London p.
I hate going there and I live right next to it.
I'm just enumerating the wide variety of reasons not to London.
We should sort out the hogmanay deal so I can get cheaper flights.
And see if we can budget flying MoonWolf over.
Let me open a calendar.
Oh awesome 1st is a Friday.
Meaning no work on the 2nd.
Anathema that is not a thing you should feel in any way oblidged to do.
Ok there is a 3 day week between xmas and new year.
I'll definitely have to work at least one day maybe two won't know for certain until November sadly.
But if I tell my boss I have people over I can defs get the 31st off.
And if I'm only working one day it'll be the 29th.
My flat is on a bus route directly from town maybe even from the station.
I have 11 days of holiday left this year gonna be nice.
Maybe you should spend them better.
I like to have a big chunk around christmas / hogmanay off.
Ok the bus stop actually at the station is going the wrong way.
The one going in the right direction is a wee walk a way.
Google maps now knows bus routes.
Only that's not strictly true.
It knows bus stops and which buses go to which stops.
What it does not know is which roads the buses use.
So if you ask how to get somewhere by bus it will paint you a series of zigzags through buildings and train tracks and rivers.
In order to get to all the right stops as directly as possible.
Over here we 9292ov.nl.
It can plan you a route from anywhere to anywhere in the country through all available public transit options.
Lion portals are bullshit.
In divinity OS 2 you cna no be a skeleton.
Well finally finished sleeping dogs.
What a disappointing ending.
I got a golden Skycap'n Kragg.
Is this one of the dungeon waifus if anyone knows?
Oh that might be pixiv being dumb.
Way too long and thus predictable.
Does need the Who? at the end though.
Cooked_Auto this book title.
Knowing previous book readings it will be quite the... feast.
Noelor You know what? The actual title page is even better than that post.
Windows is showing my external HD as RAW.
After it failed to copy stuff.
But my PS3 seems to read it fine.
..and now my PS3 overheated.
Gnome has written a game powered by the apocalypse about being a band of heroes on an adventure to save the world.
Influences include LotR Avatar Wakfu and Jojo 3.
The rules include be a hero and address characters not players.
I could never play this game by the rules.
Play as the Elf if... you want to be the coolest person at the table.
But everyone knows you want to be.
Although also one of the options is to be a space-elf.
Elves are actually from space.
Halflings have a move to change size at will.
From the size range apple - dwarf.
The GM gets a character called the Overlord.
One of their moves is Chew the Scenery.
It lets you monologue.
You do not need to be the Dwarf to become the Ur-Dwarf.
Mumble opens directly to the server because it's the only server I have configured.
Noelor you can also click the link PatternSpiderr gives to go straight there.
This sure is a thing.
Indeed an animu thing.
Oh gods that was some good chicken.
Well now I have flashbacks to last IRL meet I had with finnish friends.
Thanks chibi evangelion clip.
Quick name something that is done.
Should have worded that better.
GlennCuttlefish 'a verb' is what you were looking for.
Indeed why would you.
Its like you wanted to learn german but suddenly took a wrong turn somewhere and never really bothered asking for directions after that.
Omg I was actually right about this.
I can't argue with that comment even if usually I tend to compare Danish with speaking norgwegian with your mouth stuffed with either porridge or potatoes.
Cooked_Auto did you click the link though.
I mean I don't agree with the frog comment but the first one sorta.
Frogs just amused me as a rebuttal.
To me Danish sounds muddy more than croaky.
I have a better time understanding Norwegian than Danish.
This tumblr though.
S2 of rick and morty is amazing.
The one thing I agree with the southern USA on.
It is less characters to type.
YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR THIS TIME NATURE.
Doesn't sound very yum.
Does smell of vanilla though so hey.
Anathema I'll be trying this concoction for lunch tomorrow an letting you know what I think.
I left music playing while away just put my headset back on.
Very start of Stronger Than You.
Its a clip from the upcoming onepunch man.
Possibly one of the most pretentious things I've ever heard. And I use tumblr.
Now thats trying hard to be pretentious.
I left mumble running whiule I had dinner and practised guitar was not intentionally ignoring you Ember.
THE BEST DAY.
!note MairBear If you have some time today i need to see someone beat someone else in HS.
MoonWolf I'll give it a shot.
I wetshaved yesterday for the first time in years.
I think you are not doing it right.
Thanks for the 80 dust.
MoonWolf sometimes when streamers are being idiots. I open twitch chat.
It always makes me grin.
Every other time I hate it... but at those times...
MoonWolf well it looks like a lot with all the water.
Really hope this headache is caffeine withdrawal.
Anathema this stuff is definitely filling.
GlennCuttlefish anathema persuaded me to try a meal replacement shake.
RIP creator of marmaduke.
The early ones are great.
Its the dogs expression. just doesn't give a fuck.
Minister did you get a flavoured one?
This fucking dog.
I bet he doesn't usually even fetch the news papers.
I could not have this for every meal though.
Minister can you taste the vanilla at all?
Anathema I could smell it when I was pouring the powder into the bottle last night.
Not a strong taste.
I guess it's vanilla-y though.
Also I left it on my desk too long.
And the last few gulps have gone from milkshake texture to porridge.
Minister huh I got vanilla too but I cannot taste it at all.
I mean knowing it's there I can agree but I don't think I'd have called it vanilla flavoured without knowing.
Dob do you want to go to the spa or not though?
Because I can treat my mum to it otherwise.
I'd definitely say treat your mum.
Minister my plan is to have bertrand for breakfast and lunch most days and cook dinner.
I could easily eat it for every meal though om nom.
I'll be just having it for lunch.
Or maybe for breakfast and cereal for lunch idk.
Way cheaper than Â£7 burgers for my lunch.
I definitely don't feel like snacking like I usually do though so that's good?
They are really good burgers.
Is that with a drink?
Good mince fresh vegetables real cheese nice buns.
There is also a van that does a really nice middle-eastern style wrap for a fiver.
With like mint and cranberries and jazz.
I just go to Greggs and get a couple parties and a bru for a few quid.
Yeah there is not a greggs within lunchable distance of here.
Also greggs stuff is very greasy.
Is there a Greggs within a day's return trip of you?
There is a greggs in Cambridge yes.
Just realised the one I was imagining was the one outside central station in glasgow.
P sure as far south as you it'd have to be rebranded as J. Greggory Sons.
Ok there is one.
There's one by the grafton I know that.
Or there was in 2011.
Wow there's a poundland on the same street.
Yeah thats the one google found.
Next to the one Poundland.
Is that in Cambridge's Little Scotland district?
Iirc there's also a primark around the corner there.
Hmmm the gym near the new office location will be slightly cheaper per annum with the corporate discount but I don't think I can pay per month.
Set it to right.
*to D/D on pay day?
I mean it would be Â£323 for a year instead of Â£32 per month.
You know how sometimes you see something and your brain just shuts down in self defense?
Man guess I will have to eat pizza tonight.
I didnt really want to. its such a hassle to make.
But guess I should have thought about that when I was out buying groceries since I did not in fact buy anything for today.
Mostly because that was what I could make without having to buy more stuff.
Maybe I should make some as well. but I suspect pizza AND pancakes would be so hedonistic that slaanesh would come knocking on my door asking for tips.
Depends entierly on the type of panncakes.
Rewatching S1 of community while practising guitar still fucking gold.
Kowabon will be produced through rotoscoping live-action footage and will feature Bondage x Stylish Horror as a theme. wait what?
Anime times are good. yuru yuri ova's still haven't entirely finished and season 3 is starting soon.
First episode of One Punch Man has aired as well.
Subs soon I imagine.
That tv is really thin.
This fucking Dreadsteed video.
Why are you questioning PatternSpiders okay-ness ?
Took a while to get a response.
Probably my end though.
On my end that was uhm 9 seconds.
This is apparently relevant to LP13A but.
I dunno PatternSpider kinda sits in the corner and always pipes up wanting to get involved.
They don't always get acknowledged.
Some of us care about them.
I guess that counts as a hug.
Anyone fancy a mumble to help me build an arena?
Because I am feeling lost in new cards.
ChaosSmurf what was that podcast you recommended me to listen to over Daft Souls to avoid an overdose of Quinns?
Not comfortable posting NWS stuff? That reminds me havent checked morbis blog in a while.
Glenn Are you ready... to go fast?
Hopefully its going to be good again.
Catching up on lewd terrorism. Somehow this new girl is even worse than the yandere.
Yeah saw a bunch of webms involving her. Hoooo boooy.
Anna being the yandere. Thing with her is that she isn't exactly evil.
I am starting to feel kind of bad for anna in this. I mean she is insane.
Lewd terrorism? which one's that.
All the hijackers have panties on their heads.
Drat we'll never be able to identify them now!
This series just keeps giving.
Wonder how that stuff works with heavy drinking.
So I would imagine. pity that otherwise I might give it a try.
Well once its available.
Wait that article is like 2 years old how is soylent coming along did it turn to be vaporware? I am sure someone here was talking about nutritional smoothies today.
Weird that popped up on their twitter today.
GlennCuttlefish soylent is selling in the US the one Noelor and I have is from a German company since soylent can't ship to the UK due to regulations.
The brain is a weird place.
Colleague asked me to name someone inspirational for the quote boar and I said Nelson Mandela with 0 hesitation.
Yeah its all wrinkly.
And I have no idea why Nelson Mandela was right there in my brain.
But there he was.
Last night in WHFRP my one-armed elven bounty hunter wielding a whip had a duel with a night goblin fanatic and won by tangling it up and kicking it until someone else came along to finish it off.
You work with what you've got.
Then we followed skeletons until we found the tomb we were looking for.
Last week I played Unknown Armies and was a man with nothing to lose.
And I have 0 wounds 0 FP left.
And my highest combat status was throwing and we were on a plane.
So I just threw scotch glasses at the terrorists.
It was set in the 90s when glass was still allowed on planes.
Anathema doesn't that make you dead?
Minister nope! 0 wounds just means all damage I take is a critical hit.
Hence the missing arm?
That's from a while ago.
I healed up since losing the arm but goblin archers shot me.
I lost the arm because I was in a boat that got hit by a cannon.
A really small boat.
Can WHFRP crits generate a Black Knight I'll nibble your legs off scenario?
And I managed to swim to shore before passing out from bloodloss so at least I didn't die.
Although most of the lose a limb ones also include a 20% to die from bloodloss unless medical attention is recieved.
And you can spend Fate points to negate limb loss.
But I only had 1 FP so I could only negate the death from bloodloss.
I really like WHFRP2e.
It sounds like a game I'd at least enjoy a one shot of.
Pretty sure we've played a one shot of it already =p.
We used some houserules I'd probably not use again.
Also we didn't use a grid but it would actually work well with roll20.
Cooked_Auto we played a short campaign of 1e I think.
Could've sworn it was 2nd. Oh well vOv.
The one I ran was 2nd.
I assumed it was the new one.
Nah 3rd edition is weird.
I wanna run a campaign in Fellowship.
I wanna run Lamentations of the Flame Princess.
Not a fan of LotFP. too old school for my taste from what I remember.
But y'all would probably not want to play or whine about it since it uses rolled stats straight down with one swap.
Not supporting small independant Finnish studios for shame GlennCuttlefish p.
Hey my IRL group bought a copy of the rules.
I want a dead-tree copy but I don't trust DTRPGs PoD quality.
Well PoD is how you are getting your exalted book.
Whenever you'll get it.
MoonWolf not my deluxe one.
Anathema how sfw is that MGS link.
A friend of mine in meatspace has said he's boycotting DTRPG.
In account of some sort of rape rpg?
The link itself is to a long comment about feminism.
The image of the OP isn't sfw.
Anyway my response was p much are you never kickstarting RPGs again then?
Minister they removed the rape rpg and added a content policy.
Its a gif of bikini + fishnets sniper stretching while zoomed in on her crotch.
I linked purely for the feminism comment didn't even check the image I have thumbnails disabled on reddit.
Also I guess I'll read the effort post at lunch.
I have the powdered meal mix again.
's not really eating is it.
Well that's why I didn't say eating.
And used quotation marks for lunch.
Anathema I think the file name is pretty self-explanatory.
MoonWolf I agree with that comment.
I like the new features in SAI 2 but I have just one problem with it.
There isn't a translation so its all in japanese.
SAI being the paint program I usually use for stuff.
Minister I did not know pumpkins could get that bgi.
Shows how much you know I guess.
Almost makes up for all the heterocissexism Abrhamic religion has bred.
Is that a high level in witcher 3 ?
Its high. cant remember if thats actually the cap or not.
Quick googling suggests not the cap. But I am sure I wasn't much higher than 30 when I finished the game.
Ps I am starting to hate perspective.
What kind of a mad god creates a world where while drawing a cube you wont draw a single 90degree corner.
One who wanted us to have depth perception I guess.
Bah. I for one cant wait for the one dimentional revolution.
Also I am starting to run out of time with this project. My plan was to create something I dont hate by the end of the year.
Anathema I'm not a fan of how this stuff looks btw.
It looks almost like sand.
You were expecting it to look appealing? p.
But I was expecting it to look better than sand.
Also read that effort post from reddit.
Abolish all gender forever tbh.
'Half of Tangled's $265 million budget was spent on hair'.
Such a good film.
Hair's a pretty key part of a movie about Rapunzel.
They invented new hair rendering technology for that film.
And then built upon that make Merida's curly hair technology for Brave.
That was going to be my second point.
Hair is really fucking hard to animate.
And Pixar are obsessive about stuff like that.
'The lord of the rings trilogy had a budget of 281 million to put that in perspective.'.
I should watch Brave again.
I saw it in the cinema and never since but it was good.
Probs better than Frozen?
I've only watched Frozen once and 'let it go' really ups its score.
OTOH Brave has Billy Connelly.
Brave wasn't that good.
Frozen is still better even with its stupid snowmen and pointless trolls.
I really liked Frozen.
Until I thought about it harder.
Brave is probs the same.
Really covers Disney in general I guess.
I like Brave the scene where she archeries so hard she has to rip her dress is amazing.
You are not a balanced source for Brave opinions sorry.
Frozen is pretty good as long as it focuses on the humans. everything else is bad.
Yeah I can agree with that.
Toy story render farm compared to modern gaming desktop.
Some of the human stuff bothers me in Frozen too.
And there's the thing that also exists in Big Hero 6.
Of the timescale being discordant between the events as presented and the story that's being told.
Which movies I guess.
Anathema now compare it to toy story 3.
Should I know Sam Smith though?
GlennCuttlefish apparantly in the witcher 3 expansion coming there will be new gwent cards.
Are you hyped yet ?
Ehhh. not enough to download witcher 3 again.
Still gwent is awesome.
You are fairly easily feelsed anathema.
Welcome to my life off medication.
I watched the last episode of gurrent lagann on sunday and from the moment Libera Me From Hell started playing in the scene where the anti-spiral is interrogating Nia I started crying and couldn't stop until the credits.
Also I really really like the original song of Your Hand In Mine.
Oh are you off meds atm?
I considered saying probably all those pills or something but figured it'd be poor taste.
Also tbh I mock but music gets me crying real easy also.
Well that certainly is a vapid modern article title.
GlennCuttlefish It is time Arisen.
Well thats nice and all but I am not buying it a second time.
I've yet to buy or play it.
Enjoy it when it is released then.
Its pretty good if you can get past the first hour or two before you reach gran soren.
Actually its great if you can get past that part.
One of my favorites last gen.
Craftman needs no tools.
Just punch your sword into shape.
Omg that pic is rad in so many ways.
Oh cool someone finally asked him about this.
Minister i figured we'd get ot that point eventually.
But this is webcomic land so everything TAKES FOREVER.
<- The Very Private Journal of Sandal ths autistic dragon age dwarf.
I listen to an rpg podcast called One Shot.
A while back they played Inspectres - basically an unofficial Ghostbusters rpg.
This week's episode is called InspectHers.
This artcle has an image of the druid skilltrees but with wow icons.
And it BOTHERS me.
MoonWolf I get level 25 cubist achievement. But no season progress because it was 24 in season and 1 in season hardcore turns out that the season story counts HC and Normal extractions as different entities.
I have like 120 or something.
It's so duuuuulll o.
Though I did find the merits of split bounty public games.
Can you solo torment x yet ?
P much no gear upgrades have come my way since last time c.
Can you nto die running to bosses ?
Depending on luck of the rare packs.
Well if you want to spend an hour or osmething tomorrow.
You could help me out by doing the longer runes.
While i do the short distance bosses.
Like all of act 5.
I'll see I dunno when I might be around but I can certainly give it a shot if we find time.
Also one of the season story things requires a level 70 HC.
It popped up when I dinged my DH.
I might have to actually level a hc character.
My DH is not buff enough to do stupid-fast power levelling...
I'll get through it.
T7 is the best to do right?
Easiest but same bonus drops from caches as TX.
Note to self Run a game about space bootleggers.
Don't be getting my hopes up now. For referece a woman with a walking baby wasn't even pregnant when the kickstarter was announced. That's kind of amazing.
AAA videogames have been kickstarted and completed.
Completed and released an expansion.
Part 1 of the expansion.
Part 2 is coming.
After that i hope they do a sequel right away.
Instead of waiting 2 years to even start.
I got the flail at last.
And it's hilarious how it changes things.
Now if I could just get better stats on it.
Is the wrath refund flail ?
Nah the cast blessed hammer 100% faster flail.
So roughdly doubled your dps ?
How is your stock of souls ?
I also got the bracers I need but they lack the +holy damage%.
Once more i wish i could just give my friends stuff.
But consider rerolling it with the souls + act ingredients recipy.
Having it be ancient is a Big Deal.
Then gift it for a socket.
Badgering kadala for my ideal leg-armour cube.
But then I just need to add more numbers and replace one ring.
At least armor bits are cheap to gamble.
Geralt or witcher ciri.
Could be both honestly.
Pretty sure even witcher ciri had a different pommel and the amulet is wrong for ciri at least from the games time.
I can get behind this.
We have a rough standard over here.
Blue = paprike red = just salt green = bolognese.
Walkers fuck things up with their green salt vinegar.
Taking my lunch break =V.
Minister a bit late.
Yeah I ducked it a bit.
Anyway just kept having one more thing.
About 3 people in the image.
For being so tired from cycling.
I think the point is to promote cycling by insinuating the top three cycled.
And the bottom three drove and now are miserable.
This message is not communicated clearly.
Because to me it made fun of three now tired people who cycled.
It's a promotion for Cycle to Work Week though.
I thought it was shopped!
But it's shopped byvBulle them.
Omg this fucking weather forecast.
I don't expect perfect accuracy right.
But this is the second time this week I've been promised thick clouds throughout the day.
And had a sunny evening with no sunglasses.
I get it but on the other hand you're complaining about nice weather.
Just enjoy the sun ?
Why would you ever enjoy sun.
I have sensitive eyes -.
Sun means its going to either be too hot or too cold and that its too bright.
You don't like any weather GlennCuttlefish.
I got sunburn on my face last week by sitting on the wing side of the bus for a quarter hour.
You burn faster than I do.
I like windy cool autumn days.
Like I wasn't peeling or anything.
That sounds like heaven GlennCuttlefish.
Actually make that nights. but autumn days are fine too.
Wonder how tonights dinner will succeed.
First try attempting sushi.
Creative writing course for uni including tutor group forum.
Which it sounds like will end up as a hopefully more mature and talented version of fan fic fora of old.
I'm going to be skeptical on this more mature bit.
Receiving feedback on your own work and offering comments to your fellow writers.
Man internet just cant agree on how to cook rice.
Just about the only thing internet agrees on is that you should wash the rice properly.
*how to cook sushi rice.
Its very simple thats why everyone thinks you should do it differently.
That doesn't make sense. if its so simple surely there is one proper way of doing it.
You must not know about bikeshedding.
You are right I do not know about bikeshedding.
The bike-shed effect works like this people are more likely to meaningfull tehnical opinions or input on things they understand at least to some degree.
So the simpler something is the more people think they know the best way to do it.
Hence lots of people have yet another way to prepare rice.
But you won't see nearly as many people tell you how to prepare something complex.
Okay note to self When I become god emperor of mankind standardize rice preparation.
Execute everybody who does it wrong.
So probably half of asia then.
Anathema I made it to the gym part of the gym today \o/.
I might be a few minutes late this sushi business is trickier than it seems.
Just rolling them up.
Crap sorry that took longer than assumed.
I dusted out my heatsink fan yesterday diagnostics today reporting it's made barely a dent in fan speed and core temps as a result.
And i presume those are bad ?
Or it just wasn't all that dusty.
Well it's reporting CPU temp at like 70-80% of its max and fan speed at 90 when running vidja gaemz which it kinda did thereabouts before.
And this was the first time I'd properly gone in there in the nearly 3 yrs I've had it so I figured it might do something.
Apple is all about innovation.
Every time something like this happens someone's always there to find this shit.
Who has that kind of memory.
BwaS nothing about memory just reddit frontpage.
Well someone out there has to be the bright spark going hey that reminds me of a strip from a backwater webcomic I read 3 yrs ago!
I like apple for work/making things.
This fuckin' game I just played.
One very gibbed zeratul.
One very Sylvanas Sylvanas.
I think Stitches d/c'd and was AI the whole game?
And two healers probably both on trial level talents I certainly was.
Splatoon doesn't have an anime yet but it has plenty of doujinshi great.
Thanks for enlightening me internet commenter.
Isn't that called squid girl.
They did a team-up!
I can't remember what the deal was.
A Squid-Girl hat for your Kid/Squid maybe.
OFCOURSE SHE IS.
!note Noelor go you!
MoonWolf I see you on D3 should we try the thing?
Let me get more tea.
MoonWolf I hee'd.
Pokemon go home? Sure.
And my friend who plays a _lot_ of ingress was cursing she doesn't have enough free time NOW.
I want all of those.
Especially the one that uninstalls your opponents hearthstone.
3 60 taunt!? xD.
PatternSpider and anyone else name two objects.
MoonWolf When piloted shredder goes bad in Tavern brawl caption.
Oh wait I need to...
Minister desk cup.
Ok so I have desk cup mage and panther.
MoonWolf already people made frothing defender WORSE than patron.
Warsong + crazed alchemist = 60 damage charge.
Shadowmadness + confuse also.
I'm going to ignore desk because I wrote an office thing for the last time I did this.
Man I wish double action boogaloo wasn't so full of whiny scrubs.
Thats the third time in a row when I get called a cheater.
Double action boogaloo ?
Spiritual successor to The Specialists Hl1 mod.
I like the sampled section in this.
Not that I cant blame them for being suspicious seeing how much higher my score was to everyone elses.
Today's writing prompts ended up as a short piece set in the world of On the Side.
Otoh forgot the cup.
So I'll try again later if I get the chance.
GlennCuttlefish GlennCuttlefish I like it.
It's a challenge to get some of the win conditions but so far I'm really digging it.
Games only take about 1hr-1hr 30 mins. So it's not a chore like Talisman etc.
Its a board game on steam.
Looks a bit like mage knights judging by the trailers and screenshots.
If you get it and want games let me know.
How many players does it require?
It fills empty slots with bots. But 4.
So 1-4 people with robits added in.
20 buck no thanks.
I hear they're still adding to it a lot. So hopefully they'll add more options as it is though you've got a fairly panic-inducing time limit that you can't edit.
You know how dragon age inquisition had the bree grenade ?
Why can't they just call it beehive mace.
That's a much better name.
Not even this will make me want to play that game after dragon age 2.
I might buy armello once its on sale.
But for now I am saving all of my money for black friday sales.
Oh yeah I was supposed to reinstall tribes.
I agree with Mair.
He isn't even wearing a hat.
2/10 for effort if anything.
Wonder if I should make some upgrades to my going fast playlist.
Make it go faster.
I am not sure I can make it go faster without it turning into pure noise.
Might need more capping songs.
Have some proper Cena then.
Maybe i'll download this.
And a weird one.
Am I feeling cheesy enough to add danger zone to the list.
You will likely regret this.
I have decided against it.
Just not fast enough.
You don't clearly feel the need.
The need for speed.
Look its just not fast enough man.
Where did it even get all that mass from.
Dina knows what the deal is last panel.
Noelor i like this dina person got their dinosaur facts straight.
Well the feather part.
Okay velociraptor are dog sized but the issue here is a bit more complicated than that.
Because Jurassic Park raptors are Utahraptors?
I assume they went with velociraptor because its just so much cooler than deinonychus.
Technically they arent Utahraptors because that species got discovered as the movie was filming or something in the lines of that.
I must be misremembering then.
Well it had been...discovered earlier but only small fragments.
I mean they've been used as a justification if anything.
Yeah Wiki states the first finds were in 75 but the first decent one was in 91.
Xcom 2 is up for preorder on steam.
Are there decent incentives?
Some vague soldier you get at the start.
I doubt its of great value.
The hat appears to be skull facepaint.
I wouldn't underestimate a spagoodlor.
So neat fact about a videogame nobody played.
The last remnant had some pretty horrible status effects like curse.
Which basically you can only get rid of through dying.
Also it kills you.
If you want to cure a unit of people who have the curse status effect there is a special command for that.
They just stab em and then use a revive spell.
Instead of actually curing it.
I ended up with 4 Baines.
Also fun fuegen and stalagg.
Also in this deck.
Your deck sounds a lot like mine i aprove.
I keep forgetting to kill things with attack stats before Hexing =<.
I ended up with 3 Sludge Belchers 2 Sludges and a Stoneclaw on my field.
Man I need music source almost.
Ahh oh no fireballs happened and now my entire board is sludge.
Meh won the game.
Enemy just never made it through that much taunt.
I've been playing my try this hero out games on veteran difficulty by mistake.
That'd explain why said games were so awful.
I've personally switched ai mode to beginner.
Total xp doesn't seem to change all that much and the takedown count gets ludicrous.
First game as Zeratul got me nearly to level 2 so.
20+ minute games solo while watching TV not what I'm after.
Oh-ho man this article.
Pokemon Go could be a bad thing what if it sends you to antarctica to get articuno?
I'd finally get to see Antarctca.
Lamentations of the flame princess has rules for investing in property.
The butt oscillated between “reasonable quantities of junk in the trunk” and “could put a lunar module in orbit around that thing”.
Anathema you're so awful.
For being excited by property investment.
I love the art in Lamentations of the Flame Princesss.
Slaughter defines manâ€™s history. Every new era.
Is defined by the cruelty man inflicts upon man or.
Soldiers are but tools to shape the populace to their.
The victory fighting against it. To those in power.
Whims. The price that is paid to enact their desires.
Is irrelevant to those giving the orders.
Stockholm is the classiest city in the world even the drunks speak finnish Goddamnit imgur.
Goddamnit imgur is a perfectly reasonable position to take.
Huh those references go all over the place I see.
Well took a while but managed to get into the flow again. Still not as fast as I would like.
GlennCuttlefish dunno if CA already linked these but here's a bunch of drawing stuff.
Oh new SU is out =O.
MoonWolf 3/5 bonus caches in that bounty.
Cos we had a dumb demon hunter.
Kept complting non bonus turnins ?
MoonWolf never watched LotharHS streaming before tune in to ff7 boss music in arena. He loses and pauses the music. Plays Aeris' theme and reveals 11-3 arena score.
I cackled like a maniac.
I dont think I have seen that before noelor thanks.
Only problem with this is that it uses photoshop which I dont have. I should probably get it as well.
Still good perspective advice.
I... what? Have people been modding Ocelot to do what Quiet does?
Sure could be fun.
MairBear looks like it.
I feel so confused.
We bought some wire.
Specifically ribbed stretched round wire by the ton.
Re the tweet from earlier today.
Like i'll talk to you about it tonight when i've seen it.
I will watch it later on with friends.
Later on today.
I only found out it was back on by having the new ep spoiled a little =V.
I found out about it having been browsing /co/ at all for the last week.
Yeah see not something I do.
I was going to write about a cup wasn't I.
Ok anyone mind picking a setting?
Last tv you watched or game you played say.
I... do not know enough about that world.
Guess I am not going to say starsiege tribes then. P.
Fury Road was pretty self-contained.
This is a good thing about it as a movie though.
Tribes is a game in which fast right?
F it SUfic then.
Steven found out about the holy grail and decided Amethyst had it in my writing exercise.
Because Amethyst's cave is most interesting to write about.
Its mostly just piles of junk is varying states of organized.
All sorts of colours and sounds and presumed smells.
Cups can't do any of those things.
Holy grail is within the category cup >.>.
My university requires me to submit my assignments this year in serif fonts.
At size 12 naturally.
With enforced line spacing too ?
MoonWolf who do i murder for the top 2hearthstone streams I checked playing not-hearthstone?
Indented opening lines of paragraphs no additional spacing on paragraphs unless indicating a shift of perspective.
Damn i hate indented paragrpahs.
Get me some proper white space.
What's wrong with paragraph indentation?
We're now into 'standard format for published prose' rather than simply uni guidelines.
Hm sure I guess.
Kirisu she knows all her internets.
Sorry that took me a couple seconds to work out.
Anyway biking home now.
I have a 7-health loot hoarder.
Because he says twice.
And the brawl says twice.
And neither is +1.
So did you gush about SU already ember?
GlennCuttlefish she knows all her internets.
Overall I think this is my favorite connie episode.
No spoilrs pls cant watch until tomorrow.
Omg ana you cunt.
Oh hey one of the new leaders in CivBE is Scottish.
The North Sea Alliance which I guess is the theoretical Scotland/Scandinavia region?
Can us dutch people be in there.
I think you're Integr.
I guess any of them really.
I mean they're not orange but.
Wandering bosses are called that.
For no explained reason.
One of the companions is just I feel they should be called that.
Wow I just realized that Audiosurf 2 hasn't actually been updated at all ever since it left early access at the end of May |.
One of the companions is just I feel they should be called that <- they should.
MoonWolf the trolden from yesterday is fairly splendid.
MairBear its pretty okay.
I loved the priest deathrattle deck at least.
Care to play a few games of tavern brawl?
Damn Corbyn got 60% of the vote.
Well thats a pretty clear result.
Time for the party to pretend that didn't happen.
This is hilarious.
But that is forbidden love.
But is your love forbidden enough to summon flowers.
Well guess this is a good enough excuse to go and buy a temporary sim adapter.
The headphone jack in my lumia is dying.
And this galaxy S3 mini only accepts normal sized sim cards.
Zygarde what are you even.
Greninja are you mega or just weird.
The new kind of pokemon.
Just weird pikachu i choose you.
Well yeah Pikachu but... is just a tradition at this point.
I can't remember G4 but it had basically no new pkmn so maybe there wasn't one?
Can you megavolve raichu yet ?
Fat Pikachu with whiskers.
Oh you forgot spider pikachu.
Joltik isn't really a pikachu.
Do you think that's actually a thing or just...?
Muchu its a dragon type Pikachu.
Oh right G5 pikachu is Sugar Glider Pikachu.
So Pikachu Baby Pikachu Twin Pikachus Squirrel Pikachu Sugar Glider Pikachu Fat Pikachu with Whiskers.
None of the Pikachus from G3+ evolve.
Fat Pikachu with Whiskers ?
I had forgotten that thing exsted.
I mean it is on that Corocoro spread you were just looking at.
That was like 30 minutes ago.
Man they should do MegaRaichu.
I'm reading a SU blog and it reminded me.
I bet GlennCuttlefish loved that bit.
SU spoilers if you still haven't seen this week's.
Well he's going to have to explain how those bubled gem clustered appeared in the temple at some point.
What the fuck is wrong with that door?
I wish I had gotten those stupid glitches in my playthrough.
Would have made it more enjoyable.
Press x to break reality.
Noelor i see whta they are trying to do.
But i don't like it.
Much like the garlic sauce i just made.
Didn't have enough time to soak in the garlic flavour.
Is the punchline that they bought him those glasses that correct colourblindness?
Look at the cake better.
Get the spray bottle.
I am not sure what the hell is going on here but am certain its not canon.
Pearl is way too calm.
Maybe this is after she's had some character development.
Its shimoneta so NSFW.
I have so many qustions.
Why is she hi-fiving a taser growing out of a bandaged guys crotch while a .... dong headed person with arms tied behind their back headbutts?
That kind of question MoonWolf ?
Well they are both in fact attacking him.
Goddamnit daddy long legs I know we have an agreement but get off my screen.
GlennCuttlefish payback for when you smushed a web with your face.
Now he smushes your screen with his face.
I am not sure those things even spin webs.
Depends on if you mean the spider or the fly.
Multiple things are called that.
Oh those don't build webs either.
There is even two kinds of spiders called that.
The other kind does web.
Sylvanas -> Reincarnate is a pretty strong turn in this brawl.
An opponent clearly having decided to put all his deathrattles in included.... Deathlord.
So I cast Reincarnate and he conceded.
MoonWolf 3 games in a row I had lethal combo and mana to kill opponent.
But never drew auchenai c.
MairBear think after tihs match i can spectate you winning one ?
There you got x3.
Thanks for the pack.
It's very warlock today o.
And all of them start with nerubian egg and power overwhelming c.
So now our DD party has a goliath barbarian he is HÃ¶rpetius son of Derp.
A perfectly respectable goliath name.
I went and did some actual journalism to get some facts early.
And my editor's like don't post it would be impolite.
ChaosSmurf are you still in poland?
I'm in Bath until Friday.
ChaosSmurf you're not in games journalism you're in talking about games for site visits to make money off of advertisments.
I'm in Glasgow for another 5 hours.
Trains from Cambridge to Bath take 4 or 5 hours and need 2 or 3 stops because this country has awful public transport.
MoonWolf it can be both.
You're in talking about games for site visits to make money off of advertisments <- but thats what games journalism is.
Particularly given I have the LotV release date 7 hours before it's going to be revealed.
That would get hits.
So would the info about what they're doing pre-release.
I don't know why I'm being coy here.
In case we steal your scoop.
They're doing an animated series like Lords of War called Reclamation.
Because you don't want to burn PR relationships ?
And the release date is 21st December.
If they don't want me to scoop them they shouldn't broadcast their rehearsals from loud speakers outside the venue.
I didn't fucking sleuth in here.
It's ESL's fuck up.
I couldn't see the videos they were doing.
But all the audio was coming through.
I'm writing it all into a post now but I'm not allowed to post it.
I figured you talked to someone who was like this bloke seems okay and he really digs SC.
Anathema yeah like this.
Not lets broadcast our rehersal to the world.
MoonWolf that's why I headed up to the venue early.
Thought maybe I could blag my way in with my media pass.
But then the speakers were going so I just hid behind a van.
And wrote it all down.
30+ cutscenes according to Jason Huck.
There was actually a lot less info than I was expecting.
They're dragging it out to half an hour with the Reclamation trailer and a previously on SC2 cinematic montage thing.
But I guess 21st means they can wait until Blizzcon to talk campaign details.
They have to have someting left to talk about at blizzcon for sc2.
Yeah I thought the release date would be sooner and they wouldn't bother.
But the multiplayer's still fucked.
Well maybe they'll eventually give in and change things up drastically.
Removing all the mandatory micro was a good start.
But just that a start.
They put all the mandatory macro back in last night.
Sc2 team continues to be afraid of change for their game desperately in need of change.
They're 50/50 on if they should half-way house it.
Or revert to HotS style.
They're going to be even more mad when the release date is announced.
Though I guess it's as far away from now as it could realistically be.
I think a few are still holding out hope it'll be delayed until March tho.
ChaosSmurf the date is weird because on the one hand.
It should have been out for like 9 months already.
But on the other hand.
It need half a year more work.
Starcraft 2 we don't know how to pull a diablo 3 on this agme.
MoonWolf the multiplayer just needed to be a seperate game.
Campaign's clearly been done for months.
I have an interview with Sigaty in an hour and 20.
That dog looks like some kind of mutant squirrel.
Well it probably is.
17 days until The Martian is out.
Anathema I'm considering whether I should wait until I've read the book.
The trailer I saw for it probably spoiled enough of the book S.
Also threaddits in /r/movies with all the hype.
That surprises me 0.
Trailers spoiling movies? Say it isnt so. This truly is a post-Sphere world we are living in.
You will not go turn the lights off etc.
I'm going to do another arena in hearthstone if anyone wants some shadenfreude via mumble.
If anyone wonders the trailers for The Sphere pretty much revealed the entire plot and reveal of the movie or something dumb like that.
I don't even know what that movie is.
Then go watch its trailer and find out.
But pretty much all trailers these days contain their entire movies.
I mean I cant blame you I just picked that up on some b-movie review or something ages ago.
Ohshi- I think I saw that one on sky movies once.
Pretty sure I've tried reading the book its based on but never came that far because the only two good Michael Crichton books are Jurassic Park and Lost World =p.
I have seen 13th Warrior as well but that movie was pretty meh and I never bothered with the book.
Genisys was pretty egregious with its trailer.
Well they didn't have much to work with.
First 5 mins the antagonist shows up and he's as subtle as a brick.
Noelor the trailer does basically spoil the whole movie / book aye.
Ok I watched SU now.
I feel like there's a lot of things wrong with that pic but.
So much so I'm not even sure which direction it's wrong in.
MairBear come hang out on mumble.
Lotv cinematic coming up in 2 min.
So in todays game we fought some trolls found a baby climbed up and down some stairs for several hours and bought a giant ape.
What's confusing about that?
It's just like an ape.
We named it gori-san.
And we will teach it kung fu.
Teach it krav maga.
And so does my family.
Pretty sure I just got a french martini instead of a vodka martini.
Can nobody do anything right this weekend.
I have no idea how this works or what I'd ever use it for.
But it seems pretty cool.
FUN FACT There are enough bones in a typical human body in order to construct a complete skeleton! Oh Imgur.
That is a pretty video game name.
Cooked_Auto that is a fuckin' ugly pic of Charmander right there.
Guess it's good I didn't publish.
MoonWolf I asked Sigaty what SC2 Phoenix was.
It was the initial name of the Bnet client.
ChaosSmurf you were a bit off on that date mate.
So I have found myself in a scenario where I have 2 graphics card of the same kind. Is there actually a reason not to SLI these?
Depends entierly if they can be SLI'd or not.
Well these are SLI capable cards as far as I know.
Only problem is that I dont think my friend dropped a SLI bridge along with that computer.
Sli bridge shouldn't be that expensive.
Interesting. this other mobo should support i7.
Unfortunately its so old the socket is no longer supported so I would have to order from amazon or something if I wanted to upgrade.
Well that could've gone either a lot better or a lot worse.
See this is why I dumped her the first moment I could.
GlennCuttlefish real witchers get a harem ending.
MoonWolf you cant get a harem ending in that game afaik.
Geralt has failed as a witcher.
And even if you could why would you want to.
Unless of course there are other waifus I missed.
Because i'm playing as Geralt.
I have to maximize on waifus.
None of this only one shit.
Yes but why would you want the shitty waifu.
Like if you only played the games there was absolutely no reason to actually like yennefer.
Okay in that case.
Who has the sex scene on a unicorn.
I'll take that waifu.
You have chosen poorly.
Look i'll make you deal.
If after i finish DAI.
I'll play W2 and then W3.
And i'll just play both sides.
Second one on newgame plus.
Thing is trish is not much better.
Can i go bang a princess instead ?
Good thing i'mplaying 2 first then.
I'm not sure thats even the case.
I know there was a dragon in W2.
Grmbl stupid phone not accepting my sim card.
Windows phone accepts it just fine!
That's a week after Wednesday.
It's not the fat.
The day after tomorrow.
Yeah we talked about this last wednesday.
I'd forgotten that was this week.
It said 22nd before I changed it as well p.
I'm good at dates!
Does anyone know the dealio with Numa Numa nera.
I'm going to be in a game soon with my meatspace group.
And have no idea what even.
All I know its done my Monte Cooke and some post-apoc dealio.
Geralt is a man of my heart loves redheads.
Also other colours of head.
CA yeah my GM was explaining it as some sort of post-post-apocalyptic fantasy deal.
Thought it might have shown up in the FF thread you read.
Good old wow pvp.
There was a point you should have turned back. Clearly you missed it.
No no it wont.
Ah yes the good old days of wow.
When you had ranks of the same spell and slotted multiple ones for different reasons.
Heard the phrase the likes of you earlier today with no context.
Started muttering because I'm so much better.
Stronger Than You stuck in head the rest of my morning.
Only a little though.
If it's consolation it has spread now.
Dog knows how doors work.
Dog's wise to their tricks.
That dog isn't going to run into glass knows whats up.
This game seems kinda dumb.
Otoh the lady in the middle has a pick for a hand.
And that's alright by me.
Noelor which game ?
You may enjoy this panel.
It has footage of new hybrid beyond earth units.
And the new leader stuff.
They put the hybrid stuff up on their channel.
But I'll save it for later.
Check out the XCOM stuff too.
Nanos are not wizards.
They work like wizards.
Everybody in-setting calls them wizards.
BUT THEY'RE NOT WIZARDS OK.
Oh Mechanical is one of the adjectives.
So I can in fact make some sort of robot.
So if you decide to be an archer.
Pick one other PC to be the true friend who gave you the excellent bow that you currently use. Secretly pick a second PC preferably one who is likely to get in the way of your attacks. When you miss with a bow and the GM rules that you struck someone other than your target you hit the second character if possible.
Its a Monte Cook game and based on what I've seen on the rules of his next one it seems to be his thing vOv.
If you decide to be a bard.
!Pick one other PC. This character is your worst critic. Your abilities to help or inspire others donÂ’t function for her.
Don't make poeple pick that.
From what I can remember of the FF writeup that game has a lot of odd decisions.
See the archer thing is a bit mean.
But its more of a like funny frustration.
Unless it starts killing peole.
The bard thing is just a fuck you though.
I would argue the bard thing is less of a fuck you than making one of your party members a honorary member of the russian roulette club.
Yeah but you can tactically make it harder to hit that target.
Don't pick someone who is constantly in the melee.
Just nano I think.
Short for... nanotech user.
Well that's no fun.
Are there nano sorcerers and nano clerics ?
Nano encompasses all caster.
Latest opening line to a girl on okc.
Is Vivec not a bit of a jerk?
But what a spear!
That's what he wants.
Ok I think I want to play a cloud of nanobots in Numanumanerea.
Amazing Corbyn appointed a vegan to oversee farming.
Corbyn does not seem like he's all there/.
That's what he wants <- yesss.
MairBear nah he's really on the ball.
A vegan who is probably vegan because she is horrified at the abuse farm animals suffer is a great person to oversee farming.
Just gotta hope this reign of rationality lasts until 2020.
One of the exalted peeps has been playing MGSV.
Today is his birthday.
When he got back to Mother Base after a mission the whole platform was deserted.
Then a bunch of explosions happened.
And then he realised they were fireworks.
And then Miller and his soldiers all came out with a giant cake.
I might be forgetting things I thought Corbyn was a bit... old fashioned in the women in the workplace is silly sense... but having done some reading he sounds the opposite?
Either media is tricking me or he sounds amazing.
Then again I don't know how to political views.
Probably the media they have been on full-on attack mode.
He is probably not as fantastic as his proponents would have you believe.
Little bit of that too.
But also yes all sides of classic popular media have been painting him as various types of bad guy.
But like what other alternatives do y'all have down here?
None cause FPTP is fucked up.
I want Boris as Prime Minister.
Don't give a shit about what it would do. I want it.
I will legit move country if that happens.
Back to Scotland in preparation for the renaming to Fishland? =V.
That is 100% a joke.
Also I agree a little bit.
In other frustrating news. I lacked a specialist to research a tranquiliser attachment for a weapon in MGS. I go do a mission that tells me one is hiding somewhere.
I get him finish the mission. And then he gets auto dismissed because his stat-line was worse than someone else and my roster was full...
I have now purged about 200 staff from mother base who were dead-weight or worse.
Chucked 'em into the ocean?
Dismissed them. And since Miller technically handles that probably not. c.
Unless they make a pun on severance package to his face.
Noelor probably Finland after this weekend.
Any reason other than the delight of GlennCuttlefish's company?
Kinda hate most of my family just now.
Since you know my brother is a transphobic egalitarian ukipper.
And my dad isn't much better.
I would advice against finland at this point.
But you have lakes and forests.
Yeah but we also have an economy that is going to hell in record time.
Like our governments latest brilliant idea for fixing economy Lets cut vacations and holiday bonuses from people.
Holiday bonuses include sunday's.
Smithies and forges can produce high-quality steel objects but they generally work in iron or bronze. uhh.
Excellent the GM is on board with my playing a cloud of nanobots.
So long as I have some sort of hive body I return to.
I once played a swarm of psychic bees.
From the dimention B.
Your thing for playing sentient things that are not normally sentient and or are clouds continues.
Everybody has their own kinks vOv.
Or quirks. Or things.
I... think this is my first cloud?
Oh wait my genasi turned into a cloud sometimes.
Anyway it's a post^9 apocalyptic pseudo-fantasy game.
Pretty sure sentient nanocloud is reasonable.
Relative to tree say.
I don't think he'll let me play a tree.
Well more a tree made out of nanomachines.
May as well play a lamp.
With bonus to disguise?
If your weapon system is granular and supports lots of options you should have lots of weapons. If your weapon system is so simple I can explain it in a dozen words you should not have lots of weapons. Duh. seems sensible.
Aw yis more Dungeon Meshi.
Steel is my body and fire is my blood are the same number of characters.
1004 ChaosSmurf you were a bit off on that date mate <--- yeah they didn't know it was hitting outside speakers.
But they said fake dates.
And the reason I couldn't hear what it was probably was because they changed it each time.
So what I heard as december the 21st.
Was actually them saying Deathcember the 41st.
And before that they said December 3rd 2099.
So yeah #rekt by #blizzard.
I think of ChaosSmurf whenever I'm coding and need to call .getBoundingClientRect.
The ladies across the desk are discussing maternity tights.
Or pregnancy tights I guess.
It sounds much more exciting than it actually is.
Miracle of life aside.
Anathema that was actually very funny well done.
I have to do the inspirational quote of the day board again this week.
But I cba this morning so I put up some Iron Maiden lyrics that seem encouraging if you don't know the song.
Shoulda done speed of light.
I can't write chiptune onto a whiteboard.
ChaosSmurf how was Herald of the Stars anyway?
Minister this is very non-canon.
I have decided to call my nanocloud Hive.
Or that might just be the name of their robot host body.
But Legion would be way too cheesy even for a Monte Cool game.
Monte Cook is not cool.
Play a Monty Hall game instead of a Monte Cook one.
I am not sure I approve of hive.
Or maybe a Monty Python one.
Fuck you and your goats anathema.
With a score by Monty Oum.
Wwait wrong guy that was the animator who died.
GlennCuttlefish plenty of things have hives that aren't stripy yellow.
Even so its not a very pleasant word.
Idk what else though.
Other than stealing The Many from the 13A LP cast.
How serious is this character.
I dunno how serious the campaign is yet.
If less than 100% serious oodles.
I think I sort of overheard that one of my fellow PCs is an alcholic all of whose equipment is varying qualities of wine?
And also he's a time traveller.
And also he's a time traveller.
Oh I could call the cloud Fate.
So if someone asks how their magic-not-magic works I can say Nanos are the hands of Fate.
Kirisu call it Consensus.
GlennCuttlefish ...did I indeed.
Anyway Consensus is good Ana ty.
Works with their thing of taking over other machines.
Or 'Unity' for a Rick Morty reference.
A joke my GM would get and I wouldn't.
My other character in that group is already a Cartoon Network reference Opal the four-armed purple giant woman.
Don't want that to be my thing.
I would have suggested unity as well but I am not a fan of references and I wasn't even referencing that show.
Okay thats a lie. I am not a fan of blatant references.
Thats it feminism has crossed the line.
That's not really about feminism.
So much as about worrying about the survival of the human.
Species if we don't need to actually procreate to satisfy the related urges.
The note about the female image is an aside.
And like never don't bring that up if it's relevant fair enough.
It isn't the point of the article though.
New Vanillaware game announced.
Or finally announced I guess.
Hm Yakuza 1 is apparently getting a remake.
We've heard the feedback from the community so the Shadow War focuses on the awesomeness of being an occult super-hero while leaving the more controversial subject matter to implication or the desires of individual groups. uuuh-huh. Right.
Oh sweet jesus that font D.
Huh a Kill Six Billion Demon RPG.
You mean exalted ?
No Kill Six Billion demons. But only if the patreon campaign is succesful apparently.
!note Noelor Well this is awkward v We forgot we had a cat to make plans for and due to neighbours being unavailable I am actually staying home.
Played Paranoia last night.
Got completely dicked on by both communist PCs right at the end was glorious.
Minister I won't be making it up at all it turns out V.
This comment thread right in my feels.
What happened? Nothing disastrous I hope?
Nah in brief we forgot to plan around the cat.
So nowhere to place it on such short notice couldn't take it with us I had to stay and tend to it. I have mixed feelings of relief and guilt.
Guilt because it feels almost cowardly to take such a way out and relief because I won't have to spend 5 days in a stuffy kitchen being judged for getting no further with my life.
Ah morning coffee finally.
Unrelatedly Mair could you please send me a txt message to test something for me?
I may end up going in 2 weeks though but that is sketchy because I have other plans around that time too. Still might sneak up for one or two days.
Erm my house is very very hard to send texts from but I can try!
Who I didn't know was still definitely here.
That was received and replied to from my Pebble watch!
IRC is my panopticon.
I guess so! Since you sent back two boxes.
Your phone doesn't do emoji?
My phone is in excess of 10 years old at this point.
Phone is my first priority when salary is attained.
Emojis suck you're not missing much.
Emoji are the primary reply options from my wrist.
It was a B.
I left my Band at home or I'd reply to your reply with actual words.
I wish gmail weren't so ambiguous between folders and labels.
MoonWolf too many portals again.
And... these are not portals.
Too many spiders ?
I get malorne from a spider.
Enemy priest mindvisions it.
Gets 2 from spiders himself.
.And then mindgames it out of my deck later.
He had 4 malornes! D.
MairBear pictured a warlock who is about to be very sad.
<- its the new hearthstone meta fuck everyone having fun.
MairBear new grenade types.
Shredder has been renamed rupture it increases damage taken.
New shredder reduces armor.
Also armor exists now.
Heh that's cool too.
I just dusted every golden card I had 2x non-golds.
I can now buy 3 legends.
But that feels so bad.
Well I always dodge using golds if i can.
I just dust non golds i have golds of.
Long run I might regret it.
Short term I get to actually build decks.
What are you crafting ?
No idea other than def. sylv.
Sylvannas is a solid card to have at all times.
Possibly Varian because I love Wallet Worrior.
You do like warriro.
I want them alll~~~ Except icehowl... and flame leviathan.
Cooked_Auto that thing you pinged me on formats like an ass on mobile.
Tumblr in general is ass on mobile probably to encourage app use.
Otoh if anyone wants to save and Spider it to Noelor I'd be pretty grateful.
Might be going to Blizzcon.
Man todays hangover is one of those where you are constantly hungry.
Hm still unsure if that's supposed to be Stevonnie or Connie.
Yeah I was too but.
And her skin's dark enough to be Connie.
And she's aged up either way.
But too much steven clothing.
Is not exactly connie.
Very confused by today's brawl.
Is it portals or spiders?
But they fucked up the image.
Ok because I have a handful of portals.
Did they fix it ?
And my opponent a hunter just played a portal.
But yeah last game it was spiders.
So I just don't know.
Can we ever really know anything.
>opponent portals a Dreadsteed.
>I immediately portal an Owl.
Coyote was so angry he became bones. I hate when that happens.
So inconvenient just being bones.
Jake Solomon is quite the dude.
It's a bo- I mean mech!
Hey i liked .hack.
The games are honestly sort of bad.
.hack wasn't all that good imo.
Maybe the later series got better hack sign wasn't really worth it but for the OST.
I never finished .hack sign anime.
You are all terrible.
You are a wurst.
MoonWolf it was VHS therefore dubbed.
Just accidentally reminded myself there'll be a new SU to watch before work tomorrow morning.
Goodreads sent me a newsletter about the latest and greatest romance novels.
MairBear someone on reddit had a genuinly good idea for tavern brawls.
That'd be p cool yes.
At least Brann's parodic voice made it entertaining. That accent was so fucking over-the-top Scottish he was practically vomiting phlegm and shitting bagpipes for every syllable he spoke.
Too bad everyone else loves them.
But anathema they have the finest wires in the land.
Persona 5 stuff.
The personas have gotten pretty metal.
Hmm. morbi shills undertale on poppy's page. also mentions there is no update for thursday.
I don't need your pussy bitch I'm on my own dick Kanye is such a visionary.
Minister now thats metrosexuality.
She's going love pounding your face in.
Or whatever evil overlord minion she might encounter.
The fanciest harbringer of doom.
Got my first piece of Kingdom Death Monster.
Translated persona 5 trailer.
MoonWolf why when I join public rifts are there a billion potions on the floor.
Do they really drop that much for everyone else?
If you are really rifting hard you'll see one or two per hour.
Now consider that a public rift game doesn't have to die for a very long time.
As long as not all 4 people quit at the same time.
Meanwhile on a board I frequent the discussion has gone from sex robots to a debate on ethics of creating pre-programmed behaviour patterns on AI's.
I don't know about you but I would not have any sort of affair the helvetica scenario even if it did come free.
I love when the clkip ends with that smug cena smirk.
In its transformed state the Faceless stands nearly one story tall with an exaggerated reach and strength relative to its full form. Damn.
Just finished The Martian.
The system's actually far more annoying than that in that you're meant to not go off and make things in a cave you're meant to make little tidbits that're meaningfully relevant to people like some kind of bizarre craft gremlin haunting your city. see this manages to both get and horribly miss the point at the same time.
It's kind of beautiful.
Was it a god-awful small affair?
{opening lyrics to life on mars}.
I was actually listening to Space Oddity while reading it earlier.
So off by a decade I think.
Tremendous bnet latency tonight.
Not too upset I spent all night reading then.
Well apparently it's been a thing over the evening was at the cinema earlier and it's only just kicked in past 5 mins for me in-game.
Yeah tried grifting in diablo3 public games they either all timed out or I got the boot.
Noelor D @ The Martian.
I present to you the future of metal gear.
Use your balls to score enough points to get to see merryls butt jiggle!
Having finished the Martian I'm back to daily writing exercise.
Vomit blue on your sword and punch it into shape.
Literally hammering a spear better with moonlight.
Dammit now I have the Sailor Moon theme stuck in my head.
Kirisu here is something soothing to listen to instead.
Well I'm at work.
But thanks for the thought.
Unless that's secretly screamo or something.
Its ambient / instrumental-rock.
Also known as 10 minutes of intro to a rock trakc that never starts.
MoonWolf must also be Scottish today.
To explain these Burns.
MoonWolf I'll cut you.
I feel very threatened right now.
That was not a good time to be drinking coffee.
It missed my keyboard all is fine.
You are literally subhuman if you don't like btw.
I may be subhuman but at least i have better taste in music.
I don't get it.
Sudden realisation that since I've rewritten the two main UI components in this framework I've effectively written most of the UI.
No rwerite the rest then ask yourself 2 years from now who wrote this horrible UI.
I'm sure in two months I'll have that.
MoonWolf my code for drawing a selection box over an HTML table for example.
Check out my hacky throttling on line 32.
On the phone to IT earlier.
IT I'm not going to be putting the fix live for that problem btw.
IT Well the fix I got from the software guy involves removing about 30 lines of code from the program and I didn't write any of it so there's no way I'm doing it until he's around to blame.
7 losses in a row in tavern brawl.
I love random numbers.
MairBear pray to rnjesus.
MoonWolf I think this is when I start streaming right?
People like people getting mad over digital numbers in a GUI right?
I can't wait for more corruption plotlines.
MairBear be sure to really act out your anger.
Stand up move your arms around.
Have people seen SU yet.
I will have in 11 minutes.
The clock has started.
I shoulda seen that coming.
Even Nanefua Pizza called it.
Also spoilers for this week's SU.
Incidentally my other quest is to watch someone win.
If either of you feel like winning.
I can go win.
That was my pc.
I was closing minecraft at the time.
Which was taking up like 6gb of ram.
Achievement of the evening fixing an oven by light percussive maintenance.
I don't even know how.
Strangely enough I wasn't reciting any Martian cant so maybe not actually.
But if it was the Void Dra-*cough* Omnissiah's work then praise unto his mecha self.
I assume its rather tricky to chant in binary.
If the outward push from the charge is large enough it's possible the event horizon surrounding the black hole can disappear completely uhh.
If I ever fly I need one.
Finally saw mad max today.
Its my favorite chase scene.
So there was a minor protest of 30000 people today in helsinki.
They're cutting down on sauna times?
Which I think is rather impressive considering that all public transport was on strike today.
Nah our government is cutting sick leaves and holiday bonuses.
SU spoilers seriously just linking this for MoonWolf.
Oh a not camcorder version of this exists now.
Noelor I made that exact prediction.
The same prediction as Nana Pizza?
I can never remember her actual names.
Err. possibly I forget what she predicted however.
Assuming we're talking about SU and you've seen this week's.
2.00 in the video I linked to MoonWolf.
Otherwise I just don't know what you'd be talking about >.>.
Anathema have you seen this yet btw.
I'm assuming not but.
Noelor yes in all its glory.
Glory is the right word.
Possibly never heard that phrase in ages though.
The fact that you used in ages rather than ever.
Oh no I know of the expression and have heard it somewhere. But its been a while since last.
Sounds like a very swedish expression.
Sure our dicks are on the forehead instead down some dudes throat.
Anyone want a six pack of tablets? P.
So many shops and stuff run everything off tablets these days.
Even my bank in fact.
What no finnish under kissa?
Kissa = Cat.
Vrinsk? really Danes?
I can see it.
Something something Ragtime Gaaaaal~.
Hello ma honey hello ma baby.
They're doing an age of mythology expansion.
He's a superhumanly strong coffee-fuelled card sharp on his last day in the job. She's a sharp-shooting psychic Hell's Angel living on borrowed time. They fight crime!
Todays shirts are terrible so that'll have to do.
Minor spoilers for SU funny Peridot joke.
Noelor's in a pretty hardcore match i see.
Decking in SRHK is such bullshit.
The controls are just not accurate or fast enough.
I got the hang of it after a while.
But yeah its not good.
In 1992 after decades of plotting and planning an army of sapient communist penguins ousts humans from Antarctica entirely. Guuuuuuurps.
Continued adventures in this week's brawl.
My opponent got Tirion so he won.
And my opening hand in the next game had Sense Demons which I mulliganed away only to immediately draw it again.
Noelor it'll be great whne you portal a demon and your opponent puts it back in your deck.
I finally finished the quest the following game.
Moved on to getting my 3rd arena loss off my opponent just having a perfect opening hand.
Not your weekend for hearthstone.
Meh arena got me a tGT pack so w/e.
All dupes except for a Coliseum Manager Inspire return to hand.
It's not the worst inspire.
Many cards are bad because they are not good enough.
The worst inspire is can attack this turn.
This card is bad because its activly horrible.
Mulligan doesn't sound like a verb to me.
Blame MtG I guess.
My opponent just conceded during the mulligan stage.
I personally only do that when I auto-pilot into a game of the wrong kind.
MairBear i've conceded the mulligan on my dragon priest if i just got nothing at all on the second time.
Especially against certain classes.
MoonWolf just had a priest get nozdormu in his portal.
And then try and exploit the steal your time with portal animations thing.
Net result he had 3 turns where he achieved nothing at all so I just kept going face and won.
Fix the animation time beyond turn thing.
It'll fix every other variation of tihs problem instantly.
1620 fix the animation time beyond turn thing <--- it's a pretty vital building block to the game's freeflowing nature.
That I expect they'd rather fix individual cases of than try to cut out completely.
Right but I mean.
Not a problem in >99% of games.
Maybe not have it actually eat into the timer?
I think identifying that would be tough.
All the animations and stuff are client side.
According to my local MP we're gonna be solving the middle east peace crisis with space raiders.
Glad he has a plan.
Does she mean the game or the snack?
Well it's this twitpic.
Okay thats is blatatly cheating.
First he turns the cards ITNO OTHER CARDS then he plays them without cost and immediatly activates them.
Thats not how anything works.
But he believes in the heart of the cards.
That was actually the entire plot point of the start of a series.
Was that he introduced an entire new rule in the middle of a game.
So he could win.
Although that one is apparently an edit.
He does that but doesnt do EXODIA.
Yeah the real one is even dumber.
MoonWolf I've been listening to the 6FU archives which start with their playtest of 13A.
Apparently at some point before launch Vulnerable made crits worse instead of more likely.
That was condiered to OP ?
Nah I think it was just like.
I don't really care about this because it barely comes up.
NA Heroes championship now live watch the stream and get a portrait.
You need to connect your bnet account to your Twitch account.
Red Tornado sure is red.
Lives up to the name yeah.
Not really a tornado.
He has a letter T!
What are cats even.
A microcosm of nature's laws.
Oh that's the glenn summoning theme of course.
Ocelot That looks like a Boer goat it's raised for it's meat which is tender and delicous. almost audible drool before serious tone But don't you go eating it.
Ocelot knows Big Boss too well.
MairBear do you know what D3 counts as pets?
Is it literally anything you don't directly control or is it only stuff that shows up in the top left?
I think the latter.
Eating sushi and watching anime.
I think I caught the weeaflu.
GlennCuttlefish>> nah I think you need your dakimura and some pocky as well.
Sadly cant afford a dakimakura and the nearest place that sells pocky is in Helsinki.
Man eu bnet is partying like 2005 these past days.
MoonWolf do you know the answer to that D3 question I asked Mair last night.
What question is that ?
0009 MairBear do you know what D3 counts as pets?
For stuff like thaskers and theo ?
For this piece of armour I got that says pet damage up 100%.
Also what slot is that item that reduces set needs by 1.
As far as i know it mostly means minions summoned by your skills or passive.
Thats a ring so its a jewelry slot for the cube.
I'd probably just equip it if I found it.
Cause my current left ring is pretty bad.
And my equipped ring effect is the 3 gargantuans one.
That one is pretty nice though.
My left ring is draining life from mobs around me.
Moving next to things is a bout of a liability at T6/7 tho.
Finding doing the final slayer challenge pretty tough.
The 7 minute T6 rift one.
Even with full archyr's set.
There is no player limit on that.
Just join a public rift game and get a little lucky.
Don't wanna pussy out.
Do you know the helm legendary that summons the mimics?
I had to replace it but it seems beyond ridiculous.
I never found it that good.
But if it works for you.
It's very good with AoE patches it seems.
MoonWolf do two of the same damage bonus stack.
Like if something has two piranha pools under them or something.
If you stakc two pools it'll do the dps associated with that.
But you won't get stacked bonus % damage.
That only works if its from different sources.
You know with all these model swap quiet videos that keep popping up.
I am amazed nobody has yet replaced her with the bear.
GlennCuttlefish have you seen the baby D-Dog as Ocelot one?
GlennCuttlefish probabaly just crashes the game.
Jesus christ how horrifying.
Someone in this show I'm watching is called Moon Bloodgood.
Are you watching fanfiction ?
MoonWolf one of the actors.
I thought it was the name of a charcter not a actor.
Someone named their kid moon bloodgood.
As bad as moon is its still not quite as bad as storm.
Sounds like an Exalted name.
Have you met my friend? She's a little frightened that does make it hard for her to ride roller coasters.
Well finally got suckered back into ffxiv.
I repeat what ARE cats.
One friend started from scratch.
I kinda want to know if it's still worth playing at max without expansion.
Dont think I can access HW yet anyway.
And I finally started leveling PGL.
Mfw I log into my laotop and then can\t remember what I was going to look up.
Been watching the recent Journey to the West movie.
Major lesson do not fuck with Sun Wukong.
Unless you happen to be Buddha of course.
Now I wanna read Lord of Light again.
I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.
Well here have some gains to be jelly of.
I don't call a 68% chance statistically likely omg this Ex3 thread.
That's the most exalted thing I've ever seen.
Watched S6 of Community last night/this morning.
Actually really enjoyed it.
ChaosSmurf you know when the cw stuff's back on?
It was good for like 20 minutes.
And then was like no I'm going to be dull and serious again.
Oh it's the time it is.
Right pugilist level 18 I think thats enough for today.
Wake up my tiwtter is nothing but hour and hours of poeple talking about how david cameron put his dick in a dead pig.
So thats a thing.
Is that what ChaosSmurf was talking about.
I don't know the details because twitter.
Omg the title card for last week's SU.
Oh its really only 1 minute.
It just played 3 times during the episode.
I figured they had a longer version.
They don't tend to.
Like Donuts at the Big Donut only has the one verse.
Wake up my tiwtter is nothing but hour and hours of poeple talking about how david cameron put his dick in a dead pig <--- what the fuck?
It was a frat thing.
You're talking like it is confirmed it took place and jnot just a rumour?
2218 actually really enjoyed it <--- duh p.
Glenn on the dancefloor.webm.
I really really hope the alleged photographic evidence surfaces.
Ok so we have an email management platform running on a shared inbox.
It reproduces all emails from that inbox into a web platform with increased tracking and categorisation options.
It's also an Oracle product.
That last part is in the way of being context for what went wrong with it on Thursday evening.
When emails are reproduced in the platform they are also moved into a folder so they don't get re-reproduced.
Except it turns out they aren't they're copied into that folder and deleted from the inbox - basically the same right?
Except on Thursday evening it stopped deleting.
So the platform and folder have exponential numbers of copies of a whole bunch of emails that I now have to clear out.
I like that wikiquote has a misattributed section to its articles.
So I can look up quotes based on who people think said them.
Or coined them I guess.
It'll tell you who actually said it if known too.
Though the quote I was after this morning didn't have that.
Just also attributed to x y and z people.
Which basically means nobody's sure who other than not these folks.
Marvel's war against Fox's movie rights now has them cutting X-men from their comic universe.
No new x-men all new characters who would have been mutants a decade ago are Inhuman.
Oh good the rain got even heavier while I was in the cafe.
Going to be a fun walk back.
Fucking smart mouthed siblings. Brother asks for me to check at the local toystore for Milano and I'm just confused what it is. Until I get to the Lego shelf at the store and then it clicks >_>.
Marvel's war against Fox's movie rights now has them cutting X-men from their comic universe <- this is getting dumb.
And kinda hilarious considering how much the FF4 movie failed.
Cooked_Auto fox didn't think it was going to be great either.
They just reflexivly release a movie every now and then to hold onto the rights.
Maybe but Marvel pretty much attempting to write out the FF4 because if that movie is still amusing.
I can totally believe that Ocelot trained DD by shooting dog treats at him.
I can believe a lot of things about ocelot.
Hellooooo cease decist.
Looks like an original character do not steal to me!
He's fat you see.
Then look at the icons.
How asian is this game.
Its so asian there isn't an orriginal art asset in it.
Screenshots of Facebook game Tiny Mighty Heroes Unite.
I'm just going to hum the trumpet party of Cena's theme.
And assume that I've experienced both of those links.
We are sending payment to a Ms Cripps.
As opposed to Mr Blood.
In other news my dad is on his way to Scotland for a whisky holiday with some friends.
5 day trip in this case.
Today I'm pleased to announce that Hiroyuki Nishimura best known as the founder of 2channel has taken my place as the owner of 4chan. Huh.
Wonder if he will remove the japan ban.
Who knows we'll find out sooner or later.
What exactly is the question?
...ban is a word Google.
Back in the day moot banned japan from 4chan.
Not sure if he eve lifted that ban.
New OW stuff tomorrow.
It's probably a good move tbh.
You really don't want your anonymous board to suddenly be dominated by a language that isn't english.
They weren't banned because of shitposting from what I remember.
From what I remember moot couldn't afford the bandwidth.
Not to mention they had 2chan anyway.
That is pretty cute.
It Could be en enemy attack you never know.
I didn't realize untill now.
Because i only started watching mgs4 now.
But Sunny effectivly has two dads.
Gayest metal gear yet.
That comes up a lot in the commentary I think.
S Snake and Otacon are all but married.
I mean maybe not sexually pretty sure both of them are very much so into women.
But at the same time.
May as well be married.
Also sunny just call him snake.
He's just snake in regular life now.
Internet why you gotta be this way?
Wait does he actually shout Rocket Punch?
Unless I were some sort of sneak-man.
Though talking of which.
If everyone who spotted you is dead it still counts as hiding.
MoonWolf I think the first four panels of EGS today would have been a justifiable complete comic.
Old Snake feels lesss stressed after he reads a playboy.
Mgs4 a serious game.
Okay metal gear universe.
You really need to stop calling everything a metal gear.
Its getting out of hand.
That tiny robot with a screen is not a metal gear.
Yeah I may get this game.
People should read Dungeon Meshi if they aren't already.
Erm guys since when did steam become a dvd store?
Like a month back.
Been that for a while at least with indie stuff.
Whenever Mad Max was released.
Huh guess I missed that memo.
They never really announced it.
I just noticed it when they sold the Mad Max movie 3 pack.
Browsing for my mum's birthday gift.
Had not realised the AUD had tanked so hard in past yr or so.
MoonWolf dammit I just went back to close the tab with EGS in it and noticed he snuck Dr Who into the comic again.
I'm bad at dr who. reference.
If you say so.
Panel 3 I think is Catalina and Rhoda and David Tennant.
And then some other guy.
I don't see it.
But as i said.
Bad at dr. who.
Today i learned about fukcing japanese number puns.
Tuna pasta The best pasta.
You should have said that was OW ChaosSmurf =P.
ADB with some fresh insight into Night Lords canon.
Did you just see my retweet of that or what? >_>.
No I follow him myself.
I hope there will be a show half as comfy as non non biyori this season.
Havent looked into the Fall season much.
Well except One Punch Man.
The story takes place in a world where an unknown virus has killed the entire human population except for children under 13. Those children were then enslaved by vampires. v.
Don't watch that anime its bad.
The fall season does have a third season of YuriYuri.
But all I find interesting is pretty much OPM.
OPM is not exactly comfy.
No but then I never really go for those.
But it is great.
And yeah next season has yuru's but its more comedy than comfy.
Not even interested in the new Gundam series.
Heck it doesn't even get the first gundam stage right of specifying timeline.
Its an alt universe anyway so.
Still needs a name.
Even g-reco managed one.
The anime follows five girls who are aiming to become idols as they do different exercise routines such as push-ups situps dance yoga stretching tai chi and more. the anime version of that manga about proper stretching?
That's already been done.
Noelor nah thats just two girls.
That dungeon meshi stole my character.
Mgs4 has a permanent sunny spycam in your menu.
So you can dad while you are on the battlefield.
Why does Bolin show up halfway through that.
Also just generally lol.
Oh god I love these maps.
Today on Qwertee at least its not black.
Otoh not actually good.
But at least its not black shirts.
Yes I totally missed who retweeted that so shut up =p.
Noelor you might enjoy this though.
Cooked_Auto yeah I retweeted that from @13Age's retweet especially for you and MoonWolf.
Having heard the announcement in last week's One Shot earlier today thought Oh CA and MW might be interested in that then forgetting.
Granted I've been meaning to listening to more of that guys stuff but I barely spend time listening to podcasts as it is. Right now I only listen to the System Mastery stuff and now while I do painting during the weekend.
I wonder if ChaosSmurf is nearby.
So apparently while i was offline I got Cloud Strife's outfit as a cosmetic bonus for my subscription length. As well as a chocobo hat.
I think they go well together.
MoonWolf Majordomo + Garrison Commander.
Sure is a Day 9 stream.
Steam sells movies now?
Anathema yeah they did a couple of games-related ones and then started pushing for bigger stuff.
MoonWolf the fat one of the new Overwatch characters has a pudge hook.
Sadly they haven't given me the trailer/s.
The other one is demoman.
Might embed this in the post.
Do the th ing.
MoonWolf EGSNP - Hell it's about time.
Great now we're going to have everyone fabio-fied soon.
Sky News subtitles describing China as a major source of future herbal growth.
Are they implying china is going to take over the weed market ?
Sure just a matter of minor rebranding.
I mean wouldn't you want to visit hong bong?
Ex3 is now 700 pages.
Honestly not sure if that's up or down from the leak.
Yeah I also don't know if that's before or after the ridiculous number of backer name pays.
It down 200 ish pages from the utterly unformatted leak.
Minister they had to cut about 80k words.
Leak does not have the stupid overly long page eating backer names.
Added pictures lost pages.
Anathema maybe they cut all the stupid craft charms.
MoonWolf half the antagonist chapter.
Wanna say a heavy editing cull will have done it some good.
But can't with much conviction.
Anathema i'd hav eprefered a massive cut in all the dice trick charms.
This charm with long fluff bullshit thing lets you rerolling 6's!
0548 the Craft system is deliberately difficult and requires a lot of work.
0548 just on those grounds we knew shitloads of people would hate it.
0548 on the other hand it is the only craft system i've ever seen from an RPG that bothers trying to appeal to -anyone- rather than setting its sights as inoffensive at best.
That sounds like bullshit but ok.
2048 the way craft is fundamentally supposed to work is that you discover that the town you're bivouaced in is gonna get attacked by hobgoblins so while the Dawn is I don't know using Tiger-Warrior Training Technique to drill some farmers the Craft Weaponsmithing guy bangs out some caltrops to scatter into the town's alleyways and along the lines of approach.
2048 ding ding ding you get a shitload of silver XP.
2049 you are supposed to look at every bump in the road as you play and go how do I drag the fact that I'm a craftsman into the spotlight here?
1750 not having any crafting XP is a lot like not having any blood points in Vampire.
2226 Aquillion I did start measuring in yeddim after a certain point specifically because I knew it drove you crazy.
Thats fine and all but when will it be released?
Anathema bullshit comes out of my autocorrect as Blair.
GlennCuddlefish shortly after the heat death of the universe.
Anathema great argument from holden there lots of people will hate this because we made it actually pretty bad.
But at least when poeple use it it does stuff!!!!!
I'm a great designer.
Now please spend the whole session every session finding excuses to craft anything at all.
And then manage 3 pools of xp.
To build cool things.
Oh and also beg your ST to not have to roll it out.
Because nobody really wants to take the 20 minute break required for you to actually roll craft and use charms.
Speaking of bad games let me tell you about my last session of 5th e.
We found a dungeon in a basement because thats apparently a thing in westgate.
In this dungeon we found about a bazillion corpses.
And 14 gold teeth.
And in the very final room probably because we bitched at the GM we found an encounter.
Question about Holden's glorious account of his crafting system how many silver points for beating up Gato?
Seriously it was just room after room of yeah theres people here. They were probably fighting.
Was this a random table result or what ?
Oh and if the DM hadn't rolled abysmally bad in one save that would have been a TPK.
I dont think so.
That DM just isn't very good at times.
But seriously 3 PC's 8 enemies one enemy can deal half of the players health pool in damage if the players fails a save.
Good thing we had them hypnotized from round one and still almost ran out of ki points on our monks.
Its okay though because you only die at negative half total hp right ?
Its not okay because the whole party would have gone down if 7/8 had not failed the save in that hypnotism.
Also I had to put my favorite die on time out.
Just rolled abysmally bad.
Like my damage roll on average was 2.
Hit rolls? hahaha no.
Should have just cast magic missle.
A round went like this First attack miss. Second attack roll 2. miss.
Roll yet another 2 miss.
And the other fucking monk kept critting.
On the other hand the party of 2 monks and a warlock works surprisingly well usually.
With one or two surprise guests when they feel like attending.
MoonWolf can you remember how many things you worked out Ex3 could do to rolled d10s?
Success fail double explode re-roll?
Re-roll on specific number.
Re-roll on higher lower.
Just remember the rules guys not hard.
Anathema its not that.
Its that Dice Tricks.
They are boring math shit.
You roll a die and based on your charms each number means one of those five things right?
Or is it less/more things.
Like I dunno add 1 to the result of just one die or 're-roll up to X 5s.
MoonWolf so critical hits are boring math shit?
Except you're not paying character resources to be able to crit.
Anathema imagine if your whole class in dnd was nothing but increasing amount of critical hits and critical damag.
It's just a thing.
You still can only swing a sword.
But you crit more now.
Moonwolf so a 5e fighter then?
I was going to say 13A ranger.
Well one of the paths.
One path gets maneuvers one gets spells one gets...improved crits?
MoonWolf ok so don't only buy dice trick charms if you don't find that fun?
Ok but they're a high portion of the charms.
And often speed bumps.
Anathema what you thought after all what i said i was going to actually use crafting ?
Like I want to make a crafter.
And Holden's pitch above for their crafting play style sounds cool to me.
But from everything I've seen that play style is not made evident by the charms alone.
1248 2049 you are supposed to look at every bump in the road as you play and go how do I drag the fact that I'm a craftsman into the spotlight here? <--- this sounds fucking awdful.
Mostly because RPG players are awful.
Don't play with awful people then.
Sadly that doesn't really help DMs.
Maybe it will be less explicit in the text.
And I agree with MW on Dice Tricks if they're taking up a large portion of a limited word count.
Particularly if they've kept their policy of every charm having 200 words of lore before it gets to the point.
Eh the charms in the printed books were pretty concise.
Ink monkeys were verbose because they could.
Mostly thinking of Adorjan and corebook Solar charms.
I would legit rather it was like.
Here are the charms rules chapter.
Here are the charms lore chapter.
That would be awful.
Or y'know whatever elegant solution professional game designs could come up with.
All games should be as readable as Magic.
If you try to bale wet fresh hay besides being insanely heavy the bales will somewhat ironically have a higher chance of spontaneously combusting.
ChaosSmurf they're packed more tightly together so a spark has a better chance of spreading.
At a total guess.
Heat caused by fermentation.
ChaosSmurf I keep trying to catch you on this abs missing you btw.
Daft Souls is now Cool Ghosts the podcast.
Which means it's a weekly dose of Quinns ie more than I care for.
Replace with Regular Features?
Regular Features isn't games but is great.
Sometimes I skip an ep tho.
It's worst when it has Matt on it.
Oh what is it then?
Games comes up cause they're all now-ex industry.
Except Gav who's still at IGN.
I enjoy it a lot when it's good but it isn't on my regular rotation.
I just want to listen to something casually to keep up with the context of what's going on in games.
Do you have VideoGamer.
Beyond what CA feeds me.
I literally pay $5 a month for it cause I like it that much.
Crate Crowbar too.
That'll be yir da Miller et al?
If you want PC specific.
Blizzard have learned how fucking dull their ability vids were btw.
They still have them but the new pair come with a sizzle reel too.
Which is just them killing things and looking cool.
They sent me the vids over later.
Pudge hook guy seems cool but can't move around at all and is just a big wall of health.
ChaosSmurf how was hate+ ladies new porn game ?
Demoman-man is a demoman with lots of rad abilities.
MoonWolf PRETTY HOT tbh.
It was just a demo.
You can get it on her site.
I thought it was hilarious and a fun tutorial.
I suppose she can't put this one on steam.
In a censored form.
And all there was in the demo was a bit of boob.
I expect she'll distribute on there with a freely available adult patch or some such.
ChaosSmurf as in in 3 and a bit hours?
And info on the chars.
No beta I think.
Unless they decided hey lets not send them that bit early.
They better have a beta sometime soon.
Unless they are saving that for blizzcon.
It's between Prague and Bcon.
Or at least that was the plan last weekend.
That was implied to me not directly said.
If it's after Blizzcon it'll be like December.
Because they'll want to get out of the way of the SC2 laucnh.
I forget every time that McCree has BAMF written on his belt buckle.
Launch sc2 game 3 and then forget it ever existed.
Move on as a company.
But he can't even teleport.
That's the plan lol.
It's not the plan.
They're gonna support it like Diablo for at least a year.
Big patches to all sides of the game etc.
What's the deal with uh.
Borderlands people's cartoonish team shooter?
That I got an email about yesterday.
ChaosSmurf i don't really get that i'm expecting mostly a few balance updates to the multiplayer.
And which just seems like Overwatch but out sooner.
As i understand it for now sc2 is not planning any additiona content so there is little need to keep it hyped up.
IF YOU READ MY INTERVIEW GOD.
Chris and Jason were both like.
For co-op and archon mode and other stuff.
That is what was in his interview.
Well not from Jason.
Because I haven't written that one yet.
Well if you'd written an interview about D3's next expansion i'd have read it!
THAT'LL BE IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS WON'T IT.
I am going to Blizzcon incidentally.
Well i guess i'll read that in a couple of months.
Flying out thursday back Sunday.
I'm sure I'll be fine and not jet lagged at all.
Enjoy the least exclusive loot bag yet.
There will probably be a minipet for wow and or d3.
And a HS cardback.
I'm not sure what sc2 gets.
Pick your favourite blizz site it should be 2-3 posts down.
I assume you'll just watched pirated streams again tho v.
If there is even any streams i want to watch.
Last blizzcon was a weak blizzcon.
They've also announced you can just order the physical loot online this year.
Opening ceremony is public.
They announced Overwatch last year you madman.
And THAT WAS IT.
That was the only cool thing.
There is rarely more than one properly cool thing.
Oh i guess they had d3 panel where they ended up making an item that is now like one of the 5 rings anyone ever uses.
Portraits has to be the weakest thing.
The murky joke has worn thin.
For our starcraft 2 fans a thing nobody will ever see.
Yeah the cosmetics for SC2 never really got off the ground.
I think at some point someone quietly took a bit of the SC2 team's budget away.
It is by far their smallest game.
Ironically their smallest game is their biggest game its a hearthstone joke.
Although i assume HOTS is also cashing in on that sweet dota2/lol money.
See I don't know if HotS is actually bigger.
Or they're just more focused on it.
But the PRs literally said to me yeah SC2 is our smallest launch.
And yet it will be x y z work.
Don't envy those guys.
Blizzcon Fri Sat launch SC2 Tue.
Hots has some ridic pricing.
Hots its the casual moba.
Except on your wallet.
I think it would be infinitely more popular if it had the Dota or Smite model.
Or was just like cheap.
All heroes are Â£3.
No sales no price changes.
A more impulsish price.
I mean that doesn't work so w/e.
That's probably how I would do a MOBA.
$50 gets you everything forever.
Or they're $5 each.
Skins are tiered like League.
Or well how's it compare sans money?
Easier to get heroes from gold than the competition? Harder?
Like I get approximately a new hero every week atm.
I can't personally compare that one.
League has a lot of really cheap ones.
Since i played dota2 the gae where you get every hero.
Put an m somewhere in that word.
Wherever you feel like.
What's interesting about the heroes 'problem' is it isn't actually an issue at high-level play.
All my mates who play the game regularly have enough ip to buy every champion as they come out.
And at low-level play it's actually kinda useful to be able to focus your players.
Obv the Dota system is definitely better.
Because lol's money maker isn't the hardcore anyway.
Its the kid who thinks thats a cool new hero and buys it.
Yeah it's the irregular guys or people who are levelling and willing to splash a little cash.
Or folks like me who buy Â£35 worth of RP so they have presents for all their friends for the next year.
Plays a few games every week a few more on the weekend.
Did Smite get better after its early betas?
Kirisu oh yeah skins are real money only.
That's where actual cash is made.
Anathema some mates got pretty into it.
Its world championships were fun.
It's good I have 0 interest in playing it.
ChaosSmurf see but that doesn't matter becuase skins are not gameplay.
I mean obviously i don't want to see price gouging there either.
I want to play LoL again just for Arcade Sona.
But you have a lot more leeway in optional side stuff that just looks pretty.
DJ Sona's what it's all about anathema.
Only real money I've spent on HotS was to get Kerrigan a dress.
That the countess one?
Theory nobody who plays Hanzo will be good at video games.
As opposed to chitin tits or succubus.
Because arrow arcs seem difficult.
Theory i will get into the Titan beta and then stream skater guy while blasting the concept of love.
For hours at a time.
Because weeaboo shits are bad at video games.
I'm going to play Pharah and discover she's really bad and then end up maining.
Zarya or some bullshit.
Actually no that's not comparable to what happened in TF2.
JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABARRGHG *boom*.
Who looks overly technical but grossly overpowered if everyone you're playing with is bad.
ChaosSmurf didn't you main spy in tf2 ?
Overly technical and very bad if anybody knows how to play.
Just flamethrower every team member.
Bet I end up playing Winston.
That's who it will be.
Stupid giant monkey idiot.
Still waiting on the overwatching pyro.
Although if we go by tf2 stereotypes i'd be playing not!demoman.
I genuinely want to main the Concept of love.
Not safe for noelors in specific.
Lucio with an accent somewhere.
Did I tell you guys about sitting between the UK PR manager.
And the Polish community manager.
As they talked about which overwatch characters they mained.
Why is that ?
They were doing it specifically to taunt me.
Good job PR guys.
The polish community manager was actually fucking great.
Hoping he'll be at Bcon but didn't look likely.
I looked it up.
Him and dwarf prick.
Have to copy their names every time.
I'll play either some meleeish kind of thing or a fast character in OW.
Tracer is hella fast.
Cooked_Auto and GlennCuddlefish can probably type the right accents first time.
GlennCuddlefish Reinheidt has a big hammer.
And is a robot.
And is actually called reinhardt.
What even is a heidt.
Sounds like a Gen 7 pokemon move.
Look I don't speak foreign.
Closer to clean / unspoiled but whatever.
I hope Blizzard get a break on female character design.
Because having now done a character list for each.
While the first thing I would still change is Tracer's voice.
SF5 is way worse.
After sf5 I wish everyone got a break from people bitching about designs.
Hey sf5 has one character who isn't all skin all the time massive ass massive tits massive thighs.
Actually i think they all have the thighs.
Someone on that team is really into thighs.
Well MoonWolf they're FIGHTERS yeah SO.
That's what WRESTLERS WEAR.
Tracer you FUCKING BITCH you don't have a secondary fire mode.
I've never been so angry about my formatting getting screwed up.
Reaper doesn't have one either.
I wonder if they've had them added.
Man the overwatch reddit is.
Its a fandom reddit of course it is.
The starcraft warcraft diablo hearthstone ones aren't.
Neither is the league or dota ones.
Overwatch's is just barren.
I realise it's because the game isn't out but it depresses me every time.
The diablo one seemed pretty garbage when I looked at it a month ago.
One of the guys I work with is like.
Why is Dota good.
I think you can work it out mate.
Protip it isn't V.
You should send him an e-mail to complain when it's in his best free steam games list.
If I told everyone on the internet who is wrong that they are wrong I'd never get anything done I'll graciously let him wallow in ignorance.
He doesn't like it either.
He likes Heroes and Smite tho.
And yet its in his list of best games?
Typical games journalist no integrity.
The thing about clickbait.
Is it's as objective as we get.
Has working for a clickbait farm changed your opinion on browser ad-blockers?
There is a long deep dark hole to go before we hit clickbait farm.
Unless you mean compared to like.
In which case yes.
In that I now think people should white-list places they like.
But still think the internet is unusable without it.
Neither of her uncle/dads apreciates sunnies excellent egg cooking skills.
Fights over who has the biggest pauldron suddenly took a bloody turn.
That's some full internet.
Ok I'm on the bus.
Let's click that thing MoonWolf said I shouldn't at work.
I totally thought TorbjÃ¶rn had a Ã¸ in it.
ChaosSmurf the thing with Tracer's voice right.
Is that I'm sure every other voice is just as bad.
Symettra's Indian accent TorbjÃ¶rn's Swedish etc.
And I don't get it because surely Blizzard have the budget for actually British/Indian/Swedish voice talent.
Just get Peter Stormare for TorbjÃ¶rn and tell him to have fun.
His stuff in TSW is honestly amazing with how he just rapidfires between English and Swedish at places.
Mikael Persbrandt would be another fun pick.
I can't remember who that is but I recognise the name and I'm not y'know someone who needs to hire voice talent for a game I'm hyping the diversity of.
You'd also probably get better native dialogue for characters like Hanzo.
He speaks Japanese I don't know for certain but I don't think it's fantastic Japanese.
Gonna play a lot of Mercy too.
Forgotten she had all those movement abilities.
!note Kirisu the VA probably isn't final or wasn't anyway.
He's gonna come in as Noelor now just to piss me off.
That's the one I couldn't remember.
The board game I had to order from the States arrived.
ChaosSmurf did this to yourself.
Minister which one is that ?
Not to be confused with Lords Ladies.
Yeah i don't know that one at all.
Which is available in this country.
Overheard from a probably teenage girl in the noodle bar.
I hate when a guy's all like 'suck my dick'... I wanna get a strap-on so I can say 'mine first'.
This lady has poor conflict resolution skills.
Or just wants to peg someone.
Or clearly unprepared to when she meets someone who wants to take it one step furhter.
Or just believes in equivalent exchange.
Stay away from people who believe in that.
Before you know it people are now walking armor and your dog is also your daughter.
But think about the savings in radio repair costs.
ChaosSmurf wtf are either of the ults.
MoonWolf is it pegging if it's oral.
Thats just the start.
Minister I wish the fat one had the thin one's ult.
If porn has taught us anything oral is always the start.
ChaosSmurf I like the part of Roadhog's video where he Pudges Pharah.
Justice is really bad at raining.
Its like a massive shoot me now.
Junkrat is pretty demoman.
I like all the pudging.
His ult seems piss tho.
Yeah is it just.
None of the slow tanky characters look interesting to me at all.
But none of them have movement mechanics.
Minister its just his regular shot but a lot of it.
And what's the difference between his L- and R-click tbh.
Oh fuck I was going to change my description of that in the post.
Basically it shoots a ball that then shoots the shot.
So it has a longer range but acts weird.
It's actually pretty cool.
When I first watched the vid I didn't get it at all.
Yeah I'm on phone.
Anyway pudge hook cool.
All of junkrat cool.
I also enjoyed how gross Roadhog's heal looked in 3rd person.
Thats some weird lung action right there.
I thought he was hyper gross and now I'm just like no that's alright.
Going to get a few random numbers out of PatternSpider.
Well went and checked what our DM pitted us against in the last session.
Seems he used assassins.
A single assassin is ranked as challenge 8 meaning suitable encounter for a party of 4 on level 8.
There were 3 of us on level 9.
8 assassins would be a suitable challenge for a party of for on level...
Did you overcome the challenge?
Yes but only because the GM rolled abysmally bad on the first round.
Had even 2 of the assassins been functional it would most likely have been a TPK.
If we were actually using XP that would have been enough for 3 levels.
ChaosSmurf even if it weren't originally intended as final VA... she's all over their frickin' trailers now and in the cinematic.
In the weapons section of the Giant playbook for Fellowship A boulder you found Giant-Sized Ranged Dangerous Reload. You Reload this weapon by going off to find a new boulder.
Oh no Marvel Legendaries is getting an expansion with Captain Britain and Spider-Gwen in it.
Here's hoping that still says 23rd when I wake up or I might grumble quietly to myself.
Random work skype question of the day.
Did you bake the cinnamon swirls in the kitchen?
No no no no no no no!
Do you have cinnamon swirls ?
MoonWolf its more I was expecting a technical question about the framework but got a question about cakes.
More fool you tbh.
The kitchen is the framework cooking is like programming.
Now go compile the cinnamon swirls.
My IO is getting thrashed from breakfast need to wait.
Mr. Robot has received widespread acclaim from critics for its acting cinematography and technological accuracy.
A TV show about hacking praised for technological accuracy!?
Yeah well that probably means its not utterly incompetent.
Considering playing the ME trilogy when I move.
The dilemma of skipping 1.
But at the same time.
It sREALLY old now.
And its graphics did not age.
While 2 and 3 are obviously a few years apart.
Like it is definitely worth skipping.
If you start 2 without a save to import Wrex is always dead.
There are customized saves around.
For all the important choices you care aobut.
Saving Wrex is probably not worth playing ME1.
Unless he joins the group in 3 I guess.
I have not played 3.
!note ChaosSmurf is Wrex a party NPC in ME3 if he survives 1-2?
I'm trying to remember who else can die in 1.
Because I know basically everyone can die in 2.
There's one of the humans by which I mean Kaidan.
Him or space racist girl.
The correct answer is Kaidan.
Those are the only deaths 2 max.
Suicide mission in 2 can basically murder anyone you can finish that game with only you and joker alive.
I guess technically sheppard can die in suicide mission as well but it doesn't let you import that save for obvious reasons.
I'm more thinking about who might be able to miss from your party in 3 because you'd killed them.
Can't really awnser that for you.
What about shark selfies.
You know how some program files if you open them in notepad are legible as Unicode.
And some look like gibberish?
Is there a proper term for expressing that?
These files don't have an extension.
And are there to be opened by our payment software.
But they look normal in notepad?
Then they are text files.
And the other one is what.
I mean I can say it's an eligible mess of Unicode if I try to read it in notepad.
That just feels imprecise =P.
Anathema I decided to order more of the German nutrient sand btw.
As have I it should arrive today!
That sure sounds like a thing you want i your life.
I mean if I were to get nutrient sand from anywhere it'd be Germany.
Although maybe that would mean it's dug up from the Dutch nutrient beaches?
Unlike soylent/joylent its real food just powdered.
It has plenty of fibre as well as compared to a lot of mass-market nutrient powders.
Minister dutch of danish.
Germany doesn't have a lot of beach.
German beach-digging remains my favourite stereotype.
It's just so harmless and silly.
Does Germany only have a northern coast?
Its got some lakes i think.
It's just so harmless and silly <- oh you naivÃ© fool.
Oh that reminds me.
I'm practicing stream-of-consciousness writing.
I just accidentally created a superhero.
On account of it being the first week's homework for uni.
The Heap whose name would definitely change if developed has the strength of twelve men!
Literally because the experimental process that created them merged twelve volunteers into a single organism.
They are some sort of Akira-style monstrosity.
They might be a super villain now I think about it.
The other writing exercise for homework is clustering.
Take a word and write a web of associations to see what comes out.
Started with purple and ended up converging on gender issues from three different branches >.>.
I kind of want to play a skeletal paladin.
Preferably DD. Because thats where it would be the most absurd.
But I think its a cool concept. Its like robocop but holier.
So today I discovered there is both a module for Vassal and Tabletop Sim for Marvel Legendary.
I bought an umbrella yesterday.
I had to choose between a few different brands.
One of them was Fulton.
If I end up being flown off to a PMC ocean platform next time it rains you'll know why.
Play metal gear solid 5 and or peace walker.
Pretty sure the end of Thunderball had a Fulton as well.
Mu I'm sure DD would appreciate your skillset always a need for people in admin.
Mu How do you feel about getting punched in the face to improve morale ?
Do you speak any middle eastern or southern african language ?
What about kikongo ?
It's fine just say out of Boss way.
Definitly don't ever take greeting Big Boss coming off of the chopper duty.
Stay in your office or whatever you get as workplace on Mother Base.
Make sure you are nowhere near a window.
Big Boss will snipe you with sleeping darts through them.
Bonus though plenty of animals to play with.
Also get to pick a kickin rad code name.
You might also get a lame one.
What this is missing is Jabba flying out the side of the skiff in the last frame.
That's a lot of purple.
Well that tyrant and tyrannofex are dead.
Well thats space b ugs for you.
MairBear also t hose genestealers ? in the background.
Whoever uses Genestealers these days?
And their whole board cos synapse probably.
Cant remember that batrep because no mood to dig through a 600+ page thread.
Mair TSW now has hoverboards vOv.
MoonWolf i hate this brawl.
I love tihs brawl!
It seems everyone's turn 2 is go afk and rope.
3/3 opponents have not done anything on turn 2 and let the rope burn all the way.
That wasn't the case 2 hours ago.
MairBear Only 1800 funcom points for the Hoverboard. Cheaper than the 2.4k bike =p.
MoonWolf druid vs druid he passes I innervate shade of nax. He plays darnassus aspirant I living roots coin hero power.
This brawl seems to be about denying the special condition.
Literally doing everything in your power to keep your health lower.
MairBear i made a shadowpriest deck.
Even if i cna't heal you to death i cna heal you above me for free minions.
My mind just can't deal with it dunno how to make viable decks xD.
I won that because a warlock decided to pit lord when I had force + savage roar.
Shame the things summoned by the brawl are asleep.
Also it gave me a Coliseum Manager.
I dunno I think it's needed. Gives the winning player a turn to not be immediately screwed.
Plays a major role in the Krogan Bit.
I don't know why by my estimation he's like the 4-5th most popular chyaracter in teh franchise.
Same as 2 then?
Like in 2 he's barely present cause they weren't doing much stuff with the foplks that died at all.
In 3 he's there front and center like the entire time you're in that bit.
He just doesn't come with you afterwards.
And if it's not him it's his brother or w/e?
Who's a big ol' racist.
At least in ME2.
The number of possible branching paths for ME3 is fucking ridiculous.
I want to do an apocalypse run some time.
Where I kill off as many characters as possible in 1 and 2.
And see what the game thinks come 3.
Would you recruit everyone to kill them in 2?
The truest thing I've heard about the Mad Max game was this.
Is it- It's nothing to do with Fury Road Oh I'll not bother then.
I'm running a Feng Shui 2 campaign. My players are acting as the entourage for an NPC participating in a invitation-only martial arts tournament held on a secret island estate hosted by a representative of the Thunder King with representatives from the various secret war factions as the other participants. A tense post-fight banquet ended in a pie fight instigated by one of my.
Elementals in hard hats?
Can't get this song out of my head.
This trailer is kinda boss.
At least the music and editing is.
I mean the footage is so and so.
Whatever I run next this will be the last boss.
Noelor yeah they gotta be dead.
Or they might show up.
Wrathmon â€œHow did you FIT that into your pants?â€.
Mfw I boot up the PS3 and the CPU is at 80c 20 seconds after starting.
8 12 20 10 10 18.
What is this Lost?
MairBear thanks to the maths MoonWolf agreed to that I've been explaining to the others while you were offline.
You can shift your stat array to something like uh.
10 8 10 20 12 18.
Instead of 9 8 10 21 12 17 which is functionally not an upgrade.
8 9 12 13 13 17 thats a legit array right?
Have they decided she's Inhuman yet?
I love how well petunia is taking it in the latest poppy.
!note Noelor I lol'd.
TIL the author of The Martian was a game programmer at Blizzard and worked on Warcraft II.
MoonWolf seems like a bad change to me.
Anyone use one of them gaming keypads?
Like a g13 ?
Noelor uses a g13 so do i.
Thinking of getting one.
I love mine works great in basically any game with a wasd based control scheme.
Takes a bit of getting used to for your hand.
I want it for GW2 mostly.
I was using my n52 when i played gw2 bu that working just fine for me.
The mini joystick looks a bit naff.
Yes i believe noelor actually uses it for movement.
I use it for abilities/powers/weapon selects etc.
What are the keys like?
I think they are comfortable enough but thats hard to describe.
I really want a geiger counter.
Do they have an app for that ?
I don't think are any phones that come with radiation sensors.
Just reserve a lot of ram and whenever a bit flips in it that shouldn't radiation.
It wasn't exactly a serious suggestion anathema.
I want to work out if it is feasible.
Problem the code that detects for bit flips will probably be corrupted by bit flips.
Okay but that code is a lot small of a failure point that the physical space taken up by the ram.
So it would be shit in a very low radiation situtaion.
But its always going to be bad at that since you are using ram as a makeshift radiation detector.
Virtual memory might prove problematic.
So after about 2 weeks of no connection issues.
I can finally say that patternspiders connection problems are solved.
The upstream irc library fixed its issue.
If that is just an amazon search for a geiger counter and not a specific model I will knife you.
I look forward to the knifing.
I'm not really an expert so couldn't recommend a specific model.
Do you know any geiger counter experts?
Wait why do you need a geiger counter?
Dragoons fall when they want they don't need to hang on to something. Unless it's FFXIV where dragoons only fall whenever there is an AoE around.
And thats the worst little sister finished.
Immortals surprising nobody by being total dicks.
MoonWolf streamer being cocky mocking opponent secret paladin for handling sylvanas wrong.
Paladin has 11 hp he has grom and 1 durability death's bite.
Pally plays a couple of cards a secret passes. He checks for Get Down. He plays grom punches face.
He still won but that was an amusing near-throwing of the game.
It was repentance <- wrecked.
I had 2 quests for 5 rogue wins and 1 for 2 rogue wins.
Only need one more win though.
Also lol an entire skulls sniper unit that wears clothing except they all have quiet strings.
Because OFCOURSE they do.
Lol a brawl in which wratchguard is good.
I'm not sure if that's suit or just really really pale skin.
Mair wtf am i playing against here.
If I get a gaming keypad I can finally switch to a non-qwerty layout on my keyboard and still play games.
I say if it should be delivered within 4 horus.
Ooh controversial email at work.
Kirisu well are you able?
Or are you cain?
I dunno if we can.
But I have far more often seen it spelt youse.
...to the degree that was in my autocorrect already.
I read that in an old timey gangster accent.
Are youse able wise guy?
Took a while but finally defeated fucking murloc paladin.
They'll all go super sayian.
... in fact tbh I now 100% expect that's what's going to happen.
That Kerrigan will archonise with someone as the finale.
Given they've made it pretty clear she's not surviving the story.
As long as she looks less dumb afterwards i'm okay with it.
MoonWolf my spotify is currently using half a GB of RAM.
My foobar is using 19.
I don't even know how.
Thats mor ethan normal.
Wish I could find torrents all my obscure post-rock so I could drop spotify.
And my hipster metal.
There is probabaly something that rips music off of spotify as it plays.
It can probably read the metadata from the current track.
Maybe it could go through the on-disk cache I bet that is encrypted though.
Knew it was going to exist.
They depreceated libspotify in may |.
Still works for now though.
May try that tonight.
Man the bnet site is glacial.
Slow for everyone or just me.irc.
Yeah its being slow for me too.
That only took 30 seconds to load the front page!
I think they're throlling connections.
Cause once it gets in it loads super fast.
Wonder if they had data center problems they've had that message at the bottom of the client for a while now.
Yeah the oh no some part of bnet has problems thing hasn't really gone away for the last 2 weeks.
Just manifested in different places.
In todays steven universe peridot continues to not have a foot.
I have 2 episodes of SU to watch.
Gimble just messaged me on b.net.
Went on a date today and the woman was giving me shit for not having played Skyrim.
Guess I'm some kind of fake gamer guy.
I can probably ask where to get them if you care to own them.
I'm trying to work out what physical object they actually are.
Just wee plastic tags?
What even is flooping.
Well this started strong.
Its a good episode!
The status quo has actually changed a little!
GlennCuddlefish Poppy literally got a ticket.
MoonWolf can't tweet about it any more.
I'll get in trouble.
But I'll piss off everyone that follows me.
If I go on another TPP rant.
Noelor TwitchCon is talking about the history of their service.
Like TPP was what mattered.
Honestly do think they should have talked about saltybet.
Saltybet is the best thing to ever happen on twitch.
TPP prepared us for massive e-sports events.
This is a joke right.
Becuase when it comes down to it.
The current way they make money.
Start with 10 viewers.
So they need to sell that idea that You the Viewer matter.
I mean good luck steraming in 720p from our shit swervers.
That you the guy with no viewrs today could make it big on twitch.
God this is bad.
Even D9 cannot conquer my cynicism.
Thats because you're being cynical about twitch.
I knew I should have skipped this.
Day9 is being genuine but thta doesn't mean this message is genuine from twitches point of view.
I guess Thanks to Blizzard Entertainment and Capcom for making Twitch what it is today would be difficult to say with a straight face.
I'm pretty done with this.
There's new SC2 stuff at the top of the hour.
Do not care enough.
To wait for that.
I'm gonna see if it gets worse.
They haven't got to TPDS yes.
Emmet Shear reading from an autocue.
It'll just be the same thing over and over again.
But this time the coo is saying it.
Because thats how this sort of thing works.
You heard everything of note they wanted to say through djwheat.
Who is their only useful spokesperson.
The rest is not worth it.
I'm interested to see their numbers.
And whatever they announce.
I'm going to watch some saltybet.
Maybe I can write something about how shitty this is.
It'll come off as so bitter tho.
A giant blob is fighting a dungeons of dredmore diggle.
This sure is saltybet.
Can it fight Arrow's John Diggle next?
They're talking about chat.
Twitch chat aka a pit of scum more revolting even than 4chan?
Are they going to adress how chat in a channel with more than 100 people is a horrible hellhole nobody likes.
They brought the face of Kappa on.
And that the variety of twitchbots that exist do so 90% to try and contain the flood of idiocy that is their chat ?
In less than 5 minutes.
From chat is great.
To chat is too spammy to use whispers properly.
Oh yeah thats the issue.
Its to spammy to use WHISPERS.
Not to spammy to be even useful as chat.
Just to use whispers.
Okay they're introducing restreaming from their end.
Currently watching a star shaped creature fight a elephant that turns the game into a table hockey match.
Also they're becoming youtube.
They heard youtube wanted to compete with them so they decided to compete in reverse.
That is the worst choice to make.
It's probably basically no change.
Like on the backend.
Just letting people upload viodeos to where their videos usually end up.
Instead of forcing them to stream it first.
Are they going to build a non shit archive player ?
No more flash soon.
I basically watch twitch through livestreamer into vlc anyway.
And chat through irc.
The lesson here is i watch twitch by not being on the twitch page as much as possible.
Thats how good their site is.
Sorry watching hamburgler beat up a creepy ghost girl.
God this is bad.
This audience doesn't give a flying fuck about StarCraft.
They're retelling the starcraft storyline.
Carbot has done a history of starcraft short.
Carbot has done a blizzard thing short for a promotion.
Is like half of carbots production these days.
Someone convince carbot to make HS animations.
Hahahahaha that was so good.
Oh wow they showed the crowd.
There's about 30 people left in there.
Everyone else already bought the game.
Not interested in a third box.
Noelor this bait is a bit to obvious.
Noelor also what do you think about peridots whole limbs situation.
No-one buys the boxes anymore all about the digitals deluxes editions.
Oh boy this is a train wreck.
MoonWolf I think =3.
They're showing Reclamation rn MoonWolf.
Lets have a looksee.
That's just Wednesday's showing up on my feedly.
ChaosSmurf more history lessons.
Yeah it's for nerds that haven't played Brood War.
Or read the SC manual.
I am watching it because it is pretty.
The one eyed chap is the guy from the intro.
Look at that audience.
The bald guy is.
Beyond awful by the way.
Tries to be corporate.
But he's not good at it.
They are still doing the starcraft 2 3 games thing.
WHY DO THEY STILL HAVE THAT AS A THING.
Because they sell the same game.
They weren't originally going to be standalones.
But then the industry kinda changed.
And everyone noticed you could just do expandalones.
They uploaded the reveal event from Krakow onto you tube.
But the audio is cut from the audience during the cinematic.
The only reason you might want to watch it.
They like to do events outside europe.
Katowice already gets a lot of stuff.
It had a good venue.
ChaosSmurf i like how that video makes fusing into archon only on low hp canon.
The audience was cheering so loud when the archon formed that I didn't know it said POWER OVERWHELMING until I watched it later.
They also got pretty fucking hype for this pylon.
We were all about the probe.
Anathema Martian = hard scifi y/n?
This keypad iwll take some getting used to.
But not as long as you might think.
The default binds for GW2 are fucking awful.
Autorun is easier to reach than weapon 5.
Noelor why is poppy so hellbent on breaking that rule anyway?
Keep opening the map instead of using utility 3.
I think that was the final episode of lewd terrorists.
Noelor egsnp for real this time.
I can believe it.
MoonWolf considering putting astral communion in tavern brawl deck.
All the mill druids I'm facing... xD.
<- and just today I was talking about how people should wear less pants.
I even came up with a snappy slogan for my campaign.
AI ahead on xp.
C_A these seem useful thanks.
Noelor.
Pricing bots at it again.
!note Mairnai let me know when you feel like winning a match of HS pl0x.
I'll give it a go in a few.
Okies launching it up.
I summon ancient of war. In ATTACK MODE.
I've been doing that a lot this brawl xD.
Everyone burns their spells unnecessarily.
So I can just go OKAY HEAL UP BISH.
Alexstraza to the face.
Am I dead tho?
If you win it was alwasy BM.
MoonWolf in cae you didn't know special bonus in D3.
Also bought some stuff on my WD.
3rd item Hexing pants.
I was very |.
Omg this weeks SU.
Noelor is that a weapon.
Give back my LIMB ENHANCERS.
Your limbs are already pretty enhanced.
My fingers can't even FLOAT.
My fingers can't even c.
Brawl can in fact give legendaries.
But only 2 and 3 mana legendaries.
I think I'm now vs mech priest.
Is that even a thing?
Fuck yeah dutch engineering.
What the fuck happened to that pc.
Someone dropped some electronics in his sauce cupboard and decided to keep going.
I blame edi for this. Went and saw an art exhibition.
I am not sure what this list is but its dumb.
What a glorious time to be a steam user.
Really sono habira is on steam now ?
I guess thats not technically unlimited but if you are using 77tb a month i reall yhave to ask you wtf you are even DOING.
Now THAT is cosplaying.
I remember my parents got their connection cut even if we are supposed to have unlimited data.
Cant remember how much they were moving but it was a lot of data.
Pretty sure it would have amounted to at least a dozen terabytes.
They were testing streaming HD quality video to hotels.
Wtf were they doing.
You need to login to uplay to unlock this song -> click uplay menu item -> opens browser minimises rocksmith rocksmith can't deal with that and wont go fullscreen properly.
-> crack the game fuck ubisoft.
Wait a minute.
I know those stairs.
I did drive my bike up there every once in a while when I was younger.
You can literally see my house from there.
Well you could back then.
...one of the master skins for the StarCraft medic in HotS is Samus.
Also like the SW shield on the other one.
Stupid bounty event being so short my fingers protest this amount of diabling.
Danger Noodle > Nope Rope though.
I'm in favour of the nope rope.
Are you gonna get Fallout 4 and do you think it'll be the Hearthstone Killer?
What the fuck twitch chat member.
TIl fallout 4 is an online digital card gam.
Also hearthstone is volatile and will die based on a payed games popularity.
MairBear a mod that replaces birds in mgs5 with metal gears.

Grmbl what the hell final fantasy.
Thats the third time in a row that I get ifrit as my daily bonus roulette.
Also with playing a black mage in final fantasy abbreviated into BLM and at the same time reading a thread that has a side discussion on the Black Lives Matter movement is confusing me.
And then you could've been eating a BLM sandwhich.
Whats the M for.
Im sure there something better vOv.
Has *way* too much going on.
GlennCuddlefish but ifrit is easy and fast!
What's not to like!?
Mairbear its also shit xp for time it takes to queue.
Dungeon gives delicious kill xp.
Well for bonus it's efficient... but I'll give you that.
Sure if you want only the bonus.
But at this point why would you want only the bonus.
Okay end game tokens but still.
Its a bg2 class that has mass effects biotic charge built in.
Well.... knights of sidonia ended.
Somewhat abruptly and and in a very unsatisfying way.
The manga or the anime?
At least my favourite ship became reality.
Blatantly kunato x tanikaze.
All MoonWolf's ships are yuri if that helps.
Not ALL of them.
Just most of them.
This one ended up being yuri.
But did nto technically have to end up yuri.
Girl in question had the ability to be either up to a certain point.
Oh right that one.
She hooks up with yuhata green haired captain waifu.
I'm not going to spoil who tanikaze hooks up with in the end.
But you won't see it coming if it ever gets into the anime.
Well at the rate it was going the only one he was getting close to was his own left hand.
So I'll wait it out.
Nah anime hadn't shown one waifu yet.
I have no control over whether or not artists flake out and hold a book up by several months. Not my department Holden Shearer master of PR.
And that is why you didn't commision all that art when you finished writing.
But sometime before that.
In your FUCKING THREE YEAR PROCESS.
That would imply competence though.
It's not his department.
Give me my pdf holden.
Why don't i have it yet.
He's finished Page xxing I think.
Like... today or yesterday.
I guess that means the text is finalized.
I dunno if that includes the indes.
I dunno if it will have an index I don't expect it'll be great if they do.
It'll prbobably be bad.
It'll have at least one dumb joke entry in it.
I'll unlock the pdf and remove it.
I will never ever dump a raw-text version of an Exalted book as I think it seriously harms a Kickstarter’s sales from day 4 onward and produces a shallow pledge tail at the end PR master.
Yeah this is going to seriously harm the pr for exalted.
The kickstarter 3 years late.
This was specifically in response to So for the DB book you're going to prove it's done before putting it on Kickstarter right?
Feels like the Exalted team is the black sheep of the Onyx Path offices by now seeing as the other WW ones have gone smoothly.
Well I guess the DM toned it down a bit.
Other projects haven't been delayed by literally cancer sure.
So you remember how I complained about my last DD game?
Today? CR 16 fight.
Step in the right direction I guess.
I swear to gods if the next game is not spectacular I am just going to hijack the GM seat.
I mean a single minotaur is CR3.
But 10 of them.
And since damage does not scale well in 5e it was a boring 1.5 hour fight.
Heaven’s Ladder is the signature MA style of the Imperial City Fire Brigade. sure.
Stories like that let me know that despite all my failings i'm not the worst gm ever.
GlennCuddlefish what i want to know is how do you keep WINNING these stupidly overcosted encounters.
The odds are in his favour.
MoonWolf a whole shit ton of CC.
I suspect the DM is also fudging some rolls in our favor at times.
Still bullshit however this is not good design in any form.
Can i make you fight an encounter 4 times your expected encounter strength.
It won't they'll literally oneshot you while you do barely any damage.
Like if this was just one epic opponent that was significantly higher than us.
And it was the climax of the story fine.
But these were just boring mook fights.
The first fight tonight was fine.
Where do you even find 10 minotaurs.
I dont know this beholder has a minotaur factory somewhere.
Do they live in herds now ?
Converging timelines of multiple knossos labyrinths.
Raiding the lady of pains maze every 5 minutes.
They're all from the Minotaur plane. Duh.
Or they grabbed some spares from one of the MtG realms.
They added a new map to DoW1. Almost making me want to reinstall it.
Then install and mod the shit out of it or something vOv.
Thats what I did last time I played it.
I played one exceptionally WIP one once that gave you Titans. To scale.
BwaS so it was a whole map taken up mostly by a single foot ?
Don't think it had a name just really boxy titan designs and everything scaled down.
Someone mentioned this in a DoW thread on tg and my first though when I watched it was this is just a mess.
Think it was only reaver warlord warhound so not that large.
Yeah thats not a great trailer.
One-shot the place and usable in campaign XD.
I was refering to the mod tbh.
Mod trailers are 8 times out of 10 always bad.
Yeah was before 2012.
Last time I played I tried Titanium Wars and then just had some no limit mod too.
There was another pre-DC mod I had that gave the WA campaign Necrons to Chaos. Far more powerful than the Necron-Necrons ended up.
And a camera mod.
Dreaming Pearl Courtesan still capstoning with gazellecarp is so weird to me.
Gazellecarp still exists ?
Savage Witch Style... uses the growth of a long carnivorous beard as its main method of attack. um.
Time to reskin ALL OF THOSE.
The beard launches bats.
Also practitioners can run on air.
Clearly the beard act like a propeller.
The total number of Charms in the book is over 700 great.
But how many will actually be useful and not pointless filler?
Bout 1/3 of those.
Okay a number of those will be very useful.
Don't let you do aything new or different.
+1 stat for x action!
Just +x to rolls.
Ah yeah I forgot its like that here.
Classroom*Crisis. Rocket engine quoted as max speed 42 km/h. Erm.
Thats the slowest rocket engine I've heard of.
Thats below the maximum speed inside city limits over here.
Marvels of the future.
It's probably crunchysubs and missing some zeroes.
Or that would be a really boring rocket.
But you could ride in a city now and impress everybody.
Japan has pretty low speed limites.
But yeah I'd assume someone fucked a unit translation.
That stock is because of some state regulation but man that lower is atrocious.
I mean if you want to post some rad furniture you might as well go with.
You could play the Exigent of a fire god who is also a catgirl Lea Shepherd bringing the real truths Ex3 players want.
But does lunars let me play some kind of monstergirl? I mean this is clearly the second important question here P.
Playing a Lunar will not allow you to be anything.
Lunars implode their own existence.
I forgot how fucked up the drugs episode of bojack is.
The most spectacular roll from an extra Changeling session tonight as shared by the ST.
A 1 on 1d10?
Dramatic Failure when shooting into Combat.
Pretty sure that just avoid a PC death.
Also apparently plays Mage.
Kaz... made burger for a guy and the guy didn't like it...
So he had the RD team... research a better burger.
So he had the RD team... research a better burger <- thats what ?
Kaz is a hamburger perfectionist.
I fear he may be trying to turn Diamond Dogs into a food-chain in his spare time.
I thought he was trying to turn it into a big boss powered distopia.
He's... possibly been embezzling for this.
Yeah thats about right mair.
The poem linked.
Also I can finally give Quiet clothing.
Besides bodypaint and bloodsplatter ?
Actual tactical gear etc.
The last video game you played will fuse with your favorite video game and make an RPG setting. Secret World and Arma 3? Hmmmm interesting.
So I knew there was a wormhole thing cos of the smoke-bomb-in-a-car vid... I was curious what possible justificaiton there was for it.
Assuming some secret research.
No... you catch a jackal with unusual markings that are allegedly reminiscent of Anubis. That inspires RD to just make a wormhole.
Uncomfortable question. Did I just fulton an Egyptian God?
Except for the anime paz posters.
Cos Yu-gi-oh warned me about doing that.
Why is there a poster of anime paz in just a dress shirt surrounded by foxes.
Lets not consider that too much.
And why do they keep putting it back up whenever I tear it down.
Because RD are ninjas.
Wtf are you people talking about.
Also I had attracted a fly cloud.
Because I hadn't showered in a while.
The last video game you played will fuse with your favorite video game and make an RPG setting. <- Pokémon and Undertale. So... *actually* befriending Pokémon to get them on my team instead of rendering them nearly unconscious?
Apparantly we are just playing baldurs gate in blockland now.
I'm never going to tampa.
Thread Exalted 3 Has anything gone right?
The kickstarter got funded.
So is it done yet.
They just finished changing all the xx pagerefs to actual numbers.
But it's not out.
So now they'll just need to i don't know.
Waste 3 more months for no reason.
Make sure all the pictures are on the right pages.
Then not give out the pdfs because the printing isn't done yet.
And then the shipping won't be done yet for another year after that.
Ooh yeah definitely that.
Also fitting that bill today's egsnp.
Tbh Sarah's pretty tumblr most of the tmie.
I decided to do an image search at which point I was engulfed in a tidal wave of unfathomable pectoral muscles and abs lol.
You literally asked for it.
Anathema ordered my next box of Bertrand this morning - dyk they're bringing out a vegan version soon?
Its nto already vegan ?
It has milk proteins.
Gnome's announced the list of playbooks to be voted on as stretch goals for Fellowship.
They include The Pair which would be about playing as two heroes who are completely inseparable. Their core move would be about being in two places at once.
The Hatchling a monster who has grown attached to someone in the fellowship and has the power to help them.
The Elemental for playing as a being not of flesh. Fire or acid or blood - you are of an unusual composition and your people are unlike any other. <- aka 'The Noelor' at our table.
The Spider for playing as bug people with cool bug powers.
If they are inseperable.
Why can they be in two places.
I'm going to find gnome on bwf and ask.
They're like Ice Climbers inseparable.
Or given the LotR focus Merry and Pippin?
Who get pretty separated.
Fervorous Harbinger rolls 6 dice to identify lightning guy 1010477 8 7 successes.
MoonWolf that said I would rather use it for something like Banjo Kazooie.
Or any of their 00's equivalents.
In smash ice climbers have a move called wobble its an infinite combo that kills you.
Hard to set up.
Great if it works.
In addition to standard Wobbling a variation called Blizzobbling can also be performed where Nana instead uses Blizzard =v.
I didn't even know that.
I persume its even harder to keep up.
Oh FGC =V.
Thats one hell of a wind.
It probably happened in the Netherlands.
You have beaches and wind right?
So do many other counties.
We don't have beaches like that.
We have sand and dunes with dune grass behind ours.
I think that describes our beaches to.
At least I've never been to a forest beach.
Oh except on lakes.
I suspect I put too much shrimp on the shrimp half of this pizza.
Sales of Ticket to Ride overtook sales of Settlers of Catan in 2013 making it the best-selling board game in the world that isn’t also rubbish.
I have to disagree there.
Well its not rubbish I just dont like it.
I have yet to try either.
Dad bought Ticket to Ride for this years christmas game.
I think the quality here is.
So far I've only really played Carcassone Marvel Legendary and Lords of Waterdeep. So far I'm liking all three.
The news item this was brought up in was that the UK and Pennsylvania expansion is available for pre-order.
The Netherlands expansion existed already.
Apparently MoonWolf's trains are more desirable than our trains.
Even though we invented trains?
There is a Scandinavian edition too.
I'm a little salty about that if I'm honest.
Monopoly is just about the worst board game.
The Scandinavian version like the European version is a fully playable copy of the game with a different map.
NL and UK are just new maps that you need a base version to play with.
Also in that category India all of Africa all of Asia.
Surprised there is no UK version of Powergrid. Or there might be since I know there is a China expansion.
The India version also includes Switzerland!
Like on the other side of the board.
The UK version includes Pennsylvania.
I know the base version of Powergrid is Germany/US.
Rumours abound that the UK edition of Mega Civilization will ship with eighteen sheets of stickers to turn the logo into “Civilisations” on all 3000 components. heh.
A couple of guys at the cafÃ© played Through the Ages a while ago.
The box comes with six cardboard sheets detailing all the moves you can do on both sides v.
There we go.
We're the same expansion that was easier than expected!
Just found out from her comment on a post from her son that my brother had liked that my aunt's facebook photo is a picture of Powergirl.
Yeah that seems like Peridot.
!note Noelor I did!
Know that bertrand are working on a vegan versoin.
Last night in dark heresy while sneaking through a mysterious pocket of jungle in a valley in a desert that they expected to contain a hidden cultist lair.
The punk revved his chainsword to cut a glowly flower off a plant.
Alerting on of the giant guard beetles to their presence.
Everyone rolled badly that fight over like 6 attacks the beetle hit once eventually the sniper NPC on the rim of the crater above them got a good hit and killed it of course after a gunfight with a giant beetle their cover is basically blown.
They forget to get ammo before they left the city.
For the beetle fight the psyker fire one lightning bolt failed twice and then spent the fight digging a shallow hidey hole / covering herself in leaves and dirt.
This once more illustrates my whole problem with that system.
There was a fight with a giant beetle most of the actions were taken up failing miserably.
It was basically down to player choice.
The bad rolls can happen in any system.
Like the tech priest rolled 80+ 3 times in a row.
They had like 5 rounds of prep before the beetle arrived they could hear it coming its the size of a car but did nothing didn't have any grenades had left their truck with the heavy machine gun a couple miles back etc.
Dear final fantasy If I sign up as the class most needed I should not have to queue for 5 minutes.
Must not be very many people queing.
Dear GlennCuddlefish stop talking about FFXIV so I don't have a desire to play it.
I havce no willpower.
MoonWolf apparently Elliott is channelling his cat powers into Cheerleadra.
Minister wait what ?
Minister wait what ?
People just have fangs sometimes in EGS?
Things i learned from anime.
Darn heroes 7 is out already got me excited but already it's down in mixed reviews.
Guess I'm not getting that till it's 80% off next summer.
You are the cancer killing exports.
... That x should be an s.
HOMM 7 is the best exports.
Noelor get some cards on US hearthstone so I can spectate you winning.
MairBear stop ruining the economy.
Don't actually do that because that's silly.
MairBear I'm not buying American cards until the European cards are actually different.
Just mirror my collection blizzard.
Ie Gelbin summoning a poultryiser.
Why is it even seperated.
Because they wanted it to feel like WoW!
MoonWolf because oceans are very complicated.
Hrm I thought Hiimdaisy made it to MGS4 am I wrong?
She only went as far as MGS3. Made some minor stuff related to 4 I think but never anything as lengthy as the others.
MoonWolf because Blizzard are incompetant.
Because Blizzard like money is waaaay more likely than it happening on accident.
I wouldn't be surprised if there is something stupid like EU databases use UCS-2 locale but US uses UTF-8.
They would have fixed that if it were not more financially astute not to.
Also it's pretty unlikely tbh.
All their servers being private.
Because players are stupid.
And want worldwide matchmaking but never want to get lag.
So if you don't take away their worldwide matchmaking they moan about the lag.
Yeah it doesn't make any sense here.
It's because it's built on top of the WoW server architecture.
And they can rinse people for $.
Jokes on them i only ever game them money for HS once in beta.
What do you think of this HearthArena overlay btw.
That's a lame reason the animations in hearthstone are gratuitious enough to cover up any lag.
I was surprised something like that didn't already exist.
And worst case scenario it lets really bad scrubs build decks like people with a bunch of Arena experience. so uhm.
Really bad scrubs is like 80%+ of the player base tho.
From my point of view overlays like that wether its for building decks or keeping track of opponent hand and draws.
And deck quality is vastly more important than play skill in arena.
And card games in general.
At best makes you equal to someone who really cares to do that stuff a lot or in their head.
I suck at arena.
Maybe i sould try it.
I think there's a non-0 chance Blizzard nuke it.
Like they did with the how2play mods in WoW.
I'm actually pretty impressed the Hearthstone API or whatever it is is as nice as it is.
With deck trackers and such.
But their current official stance is if it only does things that players could do with some pen paper were cool with it.
Do you have a source.
I'm writing a thing.
That might be hard to dredge up give me a moment.
Also they don't have an API.
They have a logfile.
Hearthstone dumps a lot of data about the game in a logfile on disk.
Thats what most of these trackers are using.
Cards drawn cards played etc.
I believe they have talked about wanting to make an actual API for a bunch of stuff.
But as far as i knwo.
Thats a would be nice to have and do if we find the time.
And Blizzard are so very good at not finding the time.
They are great at it.
Wonder how much design/tech debt Hearthstone's running into with how big it got.
This is my current favourite phrase via Ghostcrawler.
Less than a more complicated game I suppose.
By reports the game launched as just a much prettier fleshed out version of their tech demo.
The demo they made internally to sell the concept.
I Assume that since they've done a lot of cleaning up.
Around the time of Naxx.
I can't believe they didn't realise it would be massive.
Because developing that expansion without fixing things to actually be able to easily make new mechanics and cards.
Maybe not this massive.
Would be the dumbest.
It's clearly better coded than MTGO anyway.
Did you know there's a promo version of a card on MTGO.
That functions differently to the non-promo version.
Imagine how it must be coded for that to be possible.
Is it in some weird interaction or actually really different ?
It's a weird interaction that works on the non-promo and doesn't on the promo version.
That tweet chain is the best the community has on whats allowed.
Hearthstone has some really weird underwater situations and interactions.
Oh my fuck yesterday.
But often you can figure out why that is with some exprimenting.
Usually because the card text and the actual mechanics are rather different.
I attacked a voidcaller with the last durability on my death's bite.
Got the spin animation reducing his implosion imp to 1/0.
Then the animation for void-caller played bringing malganis in making his imp a 3/2.
I fucking lost it.
His malganis didn't have damage on it.
The interaction between buffs and damage is fucking garbage too.
Was the malganis played after the deaths bite ?
I.e. not like magic.
It was played by the voidcaller's ability that the death's bite killed.
If the voidcaller was played after the deaths bite thats exactly the interaction you should have expected.
Right but why didn't the malganis have the damage on it.
Either the imp should be dead because it received damage before malganis came in or the damage should be on malganis.
It shouldn't get to just chill out as a 1/0 until malganis comes in.
Moreover Warlock should be removed from the game.
Want to know another weird thing.
It lies SO MUCH.
More like Death's Bite should be removed.
The first part is just true.
Yet another Get In Here trigger.
All cards in your hand do get +1/+1.
But if you were facing a priest and he played mindgames. nope. no +1/+1.
So they don't have +1/+1 until you draw them?
That actual second effect is Give any card You Draw from your deck +1/+1 when it enters your hand.
What if you gang up afterwards.
Those draws get the +1/+1.
Also that'd be weird because you'd be a rogue.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE CARD SAYS.
In fact if you just reworded that card.
It would be fine.
But as it stands the card just lies in your face.
Remember when I said Blizzard were incompetant p.
Should be what every card in your hand for the rest of the game?
Just cards you draw into your hand receive +1/+1 but i gues they thought that was too much text.
Looking forward to your card game anathema.
I think half the weird problems like that because blizzard wants to keep card text short and snappy.
Your online ccg is much better.
Dammit Smurf with your actual keyboard.
I can't hold them.
Anyway yeah what MoonWolf said.
Rightclicking a card in the collection should have a section thats just like.
Here is the actual full wording of this card.
Also any associated cards.
Next to flavour text?
Like all the dream cards for ysera.
Or the boombots for dr. boom.
Minister yeah or somewhere else.
Yeah this card's cards.
Needs to be a thing so badly.
Even for shit like.
Spare part whats a spare part.
Here if you rightclick that card in the collection it lists all of them.
Is the squire this knight summons the same as Uther's or the other one?
I allow fallacies as counters to saying really dumb shit.
I'll just be tiny QOL changes guy.
Complain to their community manager on twitter.
The public will love me.
That's why we now have an all-mute but- aw.
ChaosSmurf i would make that option.
Just a tickbox in the options menu Mute Hero Emotes.
Day 2 would have been searching for new in your collection shows newly collected cards.
But they already did that.
I had a bad arena game once and went on a tirade at the CM.
And he was like yeah we hear it a lot we're thinking about it.
And that was a year ago ?
Couple of weeks back.
The Sun is low enough to the horizon now that it is in my eyes and burning my melanin-deficient skin even if I sit on the Eastern-most seat on the bus.
MoonWolf wait they did?
Explain this to me tomorrow night please.
Minister sun is still up down here.
Because I have not seen it.
Just type new in the search field.
And it'll show any cards with new in the text.
Or that the game wants you to know are new.
So you can hover over them for a microsecond and make that go away.
Although also that should be way more obvious imo.
Day 2 i would just add the golden filter.
Only shows golden copies of your cards.
I don't read patch notes any more.
I have a job.
MoonWolf I thought that was a filler already?
Well known fact that non programmers with jobs are incapable of reading patch notes.
Or is that just craft mode?
ChaosSmurf oh just a month ago.
MoonWolf I said don't not can't.
Day 3 a button on the crafting panel that dusts any cards you have a golden copy of.
So if you have 2 golden copies it dusts 2 regulars 1 golden makes sure you keep 1 regular.
I could have worded that better.
Dust plains until you have only two copies including goldens?
Sadly there is no category in our timesheet software for weeping at the state of software development.
Its assumed you will all be doing that internally all the time.
ChaosSmurf do you follow @TeeEyeVee?
No but it rings a bell.
MoonWolf I'll ask them about it.
He's off exalted places I think.
But nowadays he mostly tweets MtG stuff.
And I'm always like Smurf would probably get and/or appreciate that but I can't retweet it because literally none of my other followers would.
The only MTG tweets i care about are roborosewater.
I don't know what that is.
Is it like Peter Molydeux?
Or whatever that account is.
Its a twitter account that tweets one neural network generated MTG card each day.
Should be up around now ish actually.
That actually sounds cool yes.
A lot of the time its nonsense.
But sometimes its a cool card.
<- this was yesterdays card.
Genuinly a good card.
Genuine question is that how that TNG season X Twitter works?
I can never tell.
No i think thats actually people.
Until end of turn huh?
That means if you have buffed your card its a free card draw.
Or a self sacrifice for a card.
That is a cool card.
If that means your opponent doesn't get some good result out of that.
And you draw a card.
Worth it for 3.
It's the wrong colour.
Or the activation is.
Roborosewater has never been great at colours.
Feel like it's an artifact type of activation.
It's just not an artifact how is artifact not in the dictionary.
Google is basically anathema.
I'm sure he'll be thrilled.
Once yearthstone gets another big expansion or two i'm making a hearthstone equivalent of roborosewater.
Well thats halfway funded.
Looks like the BTech Kickstarter is hitting their first goal in like an hour or something.
MairBear the double inner tube =D.
And the Btech kickstarter has hit its goal.
Well the inital one.
Bleh why do I still feel shit after going to the gym this isn't supposed to happen.
We can't tell whether that recipient's face is one of joy because she received a package within an hour or sheer terror because she got it from a random dude who makes money via Amazon's new Flex delivery program.
Â€œ$18-25 per hourâ€ <- AHAHA.
Yeah no way it works out to that in practice.
Or if it does they are using that as a way to start a force and then massivly cut down on that over time.
This conjurer trainer looks like the devil child of Lacroix from VtM bloodlines.
He has that same psychopathic killer deer caught in headlights of an all too flimsy car look.
Huh. guess I will have to watch it.
What kind of rat bastard made these subs.
Also I love that she has red hair for a moment there when requested for a forgettable yuri.
Windows what are you doing.
Why are you showing my external HD at all.
Its not even plugged in.
My eyes are telling me its not enough but I have slept for around 7.5 hours. fuck you eyes we aint going back to bed.
Predition I will curse this decision later on.
I'd listen to my eyes.
My eyes ain't the boss of me.
They are pretty important.
MoonWolf turn 1 mana wyrm turn 2 coin kirin tor secret.
Enemy saps the kirin tor...
Not the 3/3 mana wyrm that will grow but the thing that lets me have my second secret for free.
Which one is ocelot though.
Which means as long as we don't make this hawk work overtime no harm done. This tiny 2 lb hawk is providing almost as much pulling capacity as a 1000 lb horse with no adverse effects. Mind the horse could probably exert itself more and run faster but as written carts go 2 MPH. Because that's how fast carts go.
So what could this bird actually pull? Well according to 3.5e/PF the average adult Halfling weighs somewhere between 25-35 lbs. Four skinny ones wearing no equipment and carrying no gear on top of a Cart puts us at exactly 300 lbs - the Hawk's favorable conditions drag weight. Assuming four skinny nude halflings with no strong feelings about animal rights they could use a hawk cart.
As a reasonable if leisurely means of transportation on any decently-maintained roads.
Funnel cakes are now some sort of meat thing.
Not sure if thats an improvement.
At least the meat is on his card?
Some more legendaries got actual entry animations.
Instead of varian just sort of appearing on your board.
Avianna flies onto the board.
Fist of jarraxus actually punches.
Unstable portal gave me a young priestess.
I had a 2/5 mana wyrm.
This is rank 11 why are you burning hex on a 1 mana creature that's not even that big yet.
Because i'm playing a shaman and i'm drowning in cheap removal.
He's lost an earthshock to my mad scientist which I grudgingly say was not awful.
Cos no secrets is a sad time c.
Drowning in cheap removal.
Well I won that but then it's a hunter game. SO probably in trouble here.
Two stars off rank 10 o.
Haha the aviana animation is great.
I certainly like it.
Lost to a warlock at 1 hp.
Cos he topdecked malganis.
It was a mistake waiting this late.
Everything is try hard turn 5 lethal.
Or just hey look at my luck turn 5 lethal in the case of that shaman.
Yesterday i gained two ranks then i dropped two ranks.
So i stopped trying for this month.
Face hunter here need to take 40 seconds and hover the card for 10.
I know face hunter is complicated and convoluted deck to play. ANd he did have legend card back. Maybe I'm being harsh.
Need to take your time etc.
MairBear there is no help.
Only malygos and spells.
Because I don't think locks have a 22-damage spell.
He put down thaurissan and then played the 4-2 charge mech.
And then facelessed it after 2 power overwhelms.
Minister malogys warlock is a deck that keeps a lot of low cost spells in hand.
Then hopes to discount then once or twice with emporer thaurissan.
Then at turn 10 they play malogys and 5 or so spells for 1 or 0 mana for lethal.
Oh because Thaurissan can drop stuff to 0.
A super fragile combo tbh.
Yeah. but when the enemy thinks you are handlock.
Even by HS standards.
They're even more likely to kill your Thaurissan?
Thaurissan is a high priority kill to start with.
And only becomes higher priority the more cards are in their hand.
In reality they don't need to kill you from 30.
But rather somewhere between 10 and 20.
And thats a lot easier and doesn't require 2 cycles of emp.
Maly + Dark Bomb = 11?
For base 10 mana?
Maly can be 8 in a single thaurissan.
That allows 2 dbs. 2 soul fires.
Playing dragon priest now just because f agro.
A i laughed i admit.
What's our actual deal tonight for tGAO?
They should just be open.
Haven't they been open for several levels now?
Hence they should just be open.
I can't remember what we got up to last time.
Are we heading to one of said open gates?
You are heading to an oblivion gate North of Ald'Ruhn to close it and acquire its plot item.
EGSNP Sarah forgets bisexual is a thing.
I mean I think that's what the deal is.
I didn't get it at all.
It'll probs make more sense Friday?
Fun fact they've been doing that since forever.
Doesn't make it not awful and demeaning.
MoonWolf who designed this an alien? is a near touch.
My opponent played poison seeds in constructed.
You never saw it coming ?
It cleared my sylvanas o.
Which I played cos I was ahead.
But it did actually not do anything to help him win.
That tends to be the problem with it.
Nearly made it back to rank 11 >.<.
It oly works if you are ahead and then why do it.
And yeah. That's why I was so surprised....
Or if you stand to benefit massivly from the deathrattles.
I mean if you're super behind you can poisonseed starfall...
But that needs luck and too much mana.
And still gives initiative to your opponent to rebuild before you can take advantage.
And you'll have maybe one or two 2/2's at 10 mana.
I'm so bad at keeping initiative c.
And now I'm up vs a golden portrait priest with all gold cards playing dragon.
I need like 20 more wins for golden priest.
I'll check after this game.
But I think the best I'm doing on any class is 110 or so.
158/500 on Warrior is my best.
I think I have 200 on hunter.
Was finally gaining upper hand on Control warrior.
Then sneed's gave him Ysera.
Then he played Ysera.
Love my ysera so much.
Probably the best legendary i've crafted.
I'm tempted to craft Varian.
And return to full on Legends For Days control.
ChaosSmurf you probably care about this an there is a marginal chance you've not read it yet.
With cats? Truly the gay agenda has gone too far.
Its a grim dark future if we don't stop man dog marriage.
Yeah catfood is expensive.
I was talking to a colleague about my rpg characters.
Realised all my Mage characters were male and that struck me as really weird.
Kirisu obviously you need more Mori.
Also! My character concepts this year fall into three categories Buff fighty lady demure librarian weird non-humanoid.
Also that second one really reads as I want to play Nina again.
Is Ember the last one?
Only because atronachs can't be buff.
Oh all character concepts. Right. Not just three.
In the past I've played other stuff.
Related I might be playing a Titansgrave campaign soon on a meatspace friend's YouTube.
And am trying to decide between Nina and Jastanka for the character.
Its a shame no-one here likes good RPGs.
So I can never ST for you again.
And with that I go home.
Anathema run fucking BSJ 2.0 when ex3 comes out then you dick.
Lesse my last couple of characters have been a a cybered up Magical Girl a rogue princess a somewhat cybered German Ex-Agent currently married to a fomori/troll.
Oh wait forgot the maverick cop.
Oddly enough all female v.
Mysterious and flashy Magician of who knows Irritable goblin girl Irritable Khajiit. And irritating magical girl.
Oh and undecided but so far quiet and discreet kobold. The mage being the only one that stops it being an all female cast by virtue of uncertainty.
Then you should back the BattleTech one instead.
I'll keep that browser open so I remember.
Fun Fact In 1596 Sir John Harrington created and installed what's considered the first modern toilet with the reservoir on top that allowed for easy flushing. One of his ancestors went on to become the half-man that plays Jon Snow. huh.
So much better than you expect.
I mena its still a horrible animation mess.
But at the same.
Is stort of works a little.
This engine is really robust with applying animation to skeletons taht just don't work for it.
6. Is â€œWe are the ones / To ignite the darkened skiesâ€ more eSports or less eSports than â€œWe are the warriors that built this townâ€?
RPS asking the real questions.
CS would be proud of this Pip article.
That face looks wrong.
? <- a good mod.
Possible the first mod for a game that new to give someone more clothing.
<- basically me playing bladurs gate 2.
And then pause 10 seconds later to repeat.
Nah i play with like 15 differetn kinds of difficulty boosts.
The fight after that takes forever.
That's much better than trying to watch it on my phone.
As opposed to that anime.
I assume that guy just walk all over the opposition.
Noelor do you just mean run an Exalted game with that?
Todays food experiment will be pizza.
Thats hardly an experiment GlennCuddlefish.
Tbh the one I did Jastanka for would be better but.
With wasabi mayonnaise smoked salmon that one plant I forget the name of.
That could be a lot of plants.
I wanna be Nina again.
Rucola seems like an accepted name.
I think my parents have rucola on theirs occasionally.
GlennCuddlefish thats not really a thing you put on salad.
Its more of a salad thing.
Look the best pizza I ever had had these on them.
Noelor evil nina ?
I am trying to recreate the experience.
MoonWolf you mean Nina?
Its either that or pay 30-40 euros for a pizza.
The joke is she was evil in BSJ.
? <- as far as pointless mods go if it bothers you that much go for it.
GlennCuddlefish waiting for it to be on sale to buy it.
Too good of a game to pirate.
Can't afford right now.
Haven't played unlikely I will any time soon.
Doesn't seem like a game I would enjoy.
Didn't really like...that demo.
The only reason I dislike that outfit is that the one you unlock costs GMP to deploy.
It costs GMP to give her clothing on a mission.
Does it come with a benefit ?
ANYHOW its late I need to stuff that pizza af.
It also costs to give Snake his MGS3 bandana.
Kojima hates fashion souls.
Is what i've learned.
Noelor I'll think about it.
MoonWolf I've been failing my melee all this time.
I should have been doing Str mod more damage x.
But I can't really see it.
OUT I drank an overdose of Hist sap while in Oblivion and gained strange telepathic powers.
Came battered deep friend and sprinkled with icing sugar.
My first meal in the US 21 years ago - a club sandwich.
I mean if a Scot is surprised at what you do to food then you are doing some weird stuff.
Yeah who puts icing s ugar on a deep fried club sandwhich.
Gonna see The Martian on saturday \o/.
You actually managed to get those tickets ?
Kinda have a date.
SunTiger how's Herithia's chances of having magic items other than the sword she stole?
I'd say grab 5 or 6.
I was actually just going to ask for a cloak.
Oh my her PD.
Well you don't need everything just ensure you cover your basic compentencies.
So get a +2 weapon +2 armor etc.
Related I found the bit of the book that says default bonuses from magic items are in addition to cool powers.
^dunno if that'll work Drive from mobile is dodgy sometimes.
If it does though look upon her defences and =V with me.
Those are some defenses.
Shame about thta PD.
Hence wanting a magic cloak.
Cloak is PD I think hat is MD?
It's probably hat hats are where your brain is kept.
I think her first advance might be the epic feat that lets her use a magic weapon as also an arcane implement.
Then I can just get a good sword or w/e.
That spear would have been great for Herithia.
SunTiger immunity to mental conditions is sufficiently unrelated to preventing a single enemy from attacking me as to skip a feat tier right?
Occultist feats are mostly pretty unrelated tbh.
The other champion feat I considered was the ability to shunt away all ongoing damage effects.
But I think it was once per day.
Hey that could have been real useful yersterday evening.
I updated the sheet with feat descriptions.
Well I have a lot of salmon remaining from yesterdays pizza.
Now I need to figure out what I should do with i.
Possibly a pie of some sort.
So I have come to the conclusion.
That undertale is one hell of a drug.
People keep talking about that game.
But i looked at it.
And it didn't seem amazing ?
Its a jrpg with some neat ideas and charming writing.
That cup of cats.
I am somewhat disappointed this story is not set in Florida.
I liked Undertale a lot when I played it at the weekend.
Not very far in.
Today on Metal Gear Reversing trucks into towers causes the truck to explode.
But it's very charming.
Not get dented in the back.
SunTiger mumble for 13A stuff?
This game of HotS has been loading for like 3 minutes now.
Close game and reconnect ?
I knew complaining would fix it.
One of must secretly be dustin.
I bet it's patternspider.
Saw the intro earlier C_A. Didn't that finally start airing in japan now.
I think its been airing in italy for a while?
Noelor cats are just small dogs.
Fine be that way.
Oh bunny is back in gunnerkrigg.
I am done with roulette in ff14.
Thats 3 ifrits in a row.
Why does finland want your money ?
Value column states GBP at the top EUR at the bottom.
We're buying a rig of some sort.
But it was a shoddy invoice so everyone got confused.
Time for one of those dreaded phonecalls.
Where you ask what the deal is.
We're sending them Euros because we's rather underpay and then send a catchup.
We can't call Finland from our phones.
Related idle query for GlennCuddlefish what's OY stand for in the context of a Finnish company?
Unrelated comment for SunTiger on SU guess we called it.
We did in fact call it.
Also bigger than the eart.
Further unrelated comment for SunTiger on EGS I'm greatly disappointed that wasn't Tensaided.
Cats are just small dogs. they can't lie so it MUST be true.
Err. no idea of proper translation.
Literal translation is stock company.
Publicly traded company ?
The Finnish equivalent of a limited company thanks wikipedia.
It'd be something like that.
SunTiger bigger is just logical.
Pearl is bigger than a pearl.
Kirisu what did you call?
SU things that are spoilers for this week.
Guess I'll watch it tonight if there is an hd torrent.
Tell you what isn't a spoiler.
Peritot is still adorbs.
Too much peridot not nearly anough lapis.
She's at the bottom of the ocean ok?
We can fix that.
Cut her some slack.
Turn her life around.
For a long time blizzard said it wasn't going to provide more deckslots since it would be too confusing.
I'm hoping that now that they have ported the game to basically all platforms but console.
And have upgraded the underlying core engine.
They'll do a pass on just stuff that should be improved.
Like fixing the observer mode.
One deck slot is too much to deal with.
You're killing esports moonwolf.
'butterfly' is a weird name for an animal that is neither a fly nor made of butter.
Or really having anything at all to do with butter.
Anathema maybe it's weird onomatopoeia.
Etymology does not give a very satisfying awnser to why.
It'll remain a mistery.
In dutch its a Vlinder.
I guess it must ?
To see a butter fly! D.
Okay i'm at uhm what i can only assume is the ending fakeout.
Since liquid snake hasn't bee beaten up at.
And its such an overly dramatic dumb thing.
Speaking of I just have one more mission to do in MGS that has plot but it proved too much BS for me at the time in a gameplay way.
Otacon is crying everyone is covered in corpses snake is busy dying on the floor because he's suffering a combination of being old and having been microwaved.
Walk it off snake.
Ah there is liquid ocelot.
We can beat himi up and finish this game that isn't nearly as good as 3.
Lol liquid just injected snake with a whole bunch of drugs just so they could fight.
Looks like this game is going to go out on two old men beating each other up.
Iirc yes insofar as player-controlled stuff.
Well so far this has only been cutscenes.
Of old men fighting.
This whole thing is INCREDIBLY dumb also really metal gear.
I don't feel I've missed out from never playing a single metal gear game.
It might be even more metal gear than the mount rushmore of just Snakes.
4 is p darn Metal Gurr.
Okay this is genuinly a great bossfight.
I just think of it like this.
If Kojima was evil he'd have made it QTEs.
Lol the mgs4 part of this bossfight is just really tired old men fight.
And shout names at each other.
Lol that final finger guns.
Hm Warhammer Conquest module for Tabletop sim. Tempting to get that thing sooner or later.
Oh yeah TDI's FF10 LP is back up again.
Yep. Just about two years ten months and one day. Yeah. That's a bit of a spell. Guess I should post an update huh? Heh.
Kept you waiting huh? Welcome back to Final Fantasy X. It's been about three years since I last played this game. I believe during the original thread I caught the flu had my computer die got strep throat had a hurricane hit me had my Playstation 2 die and then got called away for work abroad for about half a year around the time shop closed up. If updates suddenly stop this time.
Just assume I got hit by a bus or a meteor landed on me during my morning commute.
For some the LP curse strikes in interesting ways.
If you're Jade Star your computer only dies though p.
Cooked_Auto jade star actually still has the computer that died due to jaids.
They never figured out wtf was wrong with it.
Just bought a completly different pc.
The manliest of hugs.
And that's the end of MGSV.
Now I can look at wikis to try and understand what happened.
Currently on peace walker.
SunTiger what if cats are just small dogs though?
Noelor what if indeed.
Tonight really not the time to be played knocky knocky nine doors on.
Thanks random eastern european pizza delivery gentleman who can't count house numbers.
Fine be like that.
Not you my irc client.
Refusing me the use of /me.
Anyhow we started our halloween month with soma.
There was a space in front of your /me.
You two are the worst.
Not Glenn the other two.
MairBear so are you.
You are also the worst.
MairBear why so rude?
I see your worst.
And raise you a worstest.
Now you're just being ridiculous.
I'm done with this conversation.
Goddamnit my friend is leveling too fast in ffxiv.
Cant keep up with my monk.
Its the obvious solutin.
Just make him tank or heal.
He is a healer but I would rather let him catch up on the main story instead.
Meanwhile in poppy petunia is the master of possibly misunderstandings.
Petunia is basically the fans.
SunTiger can I please have access to Ember's character sheet in Roll20 again?
I need to remove her attacks from my quickbar.
Rolled Herithia's first melee attack via macro.
Never get a crit again.
This was it your one crit.
So I downloaded that yuri on a plane anime.
I dont think I can deal with this.
Well its not all on a plane.
But that webm was.
Yuri on a plane ?
Sadly doesn't seem like I saved the webm.
Check the wsg anime webm backlog.
I found out again? how to tag text in roll20 as bold.
Then found out how to switch off saving text to the log so I can test my macros without clogging it up!
A couple macros in.
SunTiger also could you change Herithia's pog from Argonian 7 to Argonian 1 at some point please?
How did tsundere turn into sassy ?
Didn't even get to finish her dream about sassy plane sex.
Sassy plane doctor threesome.
I have renamed Better Yet Here to Find the Weak Spot because I really disliked that name.
School Nurses in Japan are hardcore.
That's what that tells me.
Labcoat in casual places and everything.
Ok got all Herithia's macros sorted.
Luckily for me only 6 of her 8 spells require dice rolls.
So my macro bar doesn't extend into the chat pane =V.
Incidentally minor thing but Herithia the pog is not tied to Herithia the character at least as far as HP is concerned.
I'll fix that before the next TGAO.
In contrast to my other character Herithia's defenses are pretty high.
+4 to those numbers vs opportunity attacks.
Those are solid numbers.
That AC is comparable to the number on the paladin version of her I put together the other night.
Who admittedly didn't have magical armour.
Smug levels 1000%.
This RPS article complains that the game is too easy because of reflex mode and d-dog... you can leave one behind and turn off the other.
No tank definitly a fake.
That's Age of Empires 1.
The sportscar is one of the cheatcode units aside from the space guy with a rapid firing laser.
Also two mates of mine are at RTB EU.
And are the kinds of people who are not easily impressed.
And are giving it the Overwatch is real talk.
They really need to fix justice rains from above.
There are so many times she doesn't even get to finish the sentence.
And are giving it the Overwatch is real talk <- thats good to know.
I think people are very bad with her.
And also it is a bad ability.
Anyway I can now guarantee that the launch date for Overwatch is going to be Wednesday the 21st cause that's when I'm going to be in California for 3 days with no access to it.
Alternative 13th when I'm going to London.
Either of those two definitly.
Would be so unreal perfect.
That it now literally will never happen.
So whats currently the best affordable Preferably 100-300e or so graphics card these days?
The best part about hearthstone in other languages is the trailres with singing.
GlennCuddlefish Best recommended budget here is the AMD Radeon R9 380.
Otherwise I'm sure there is a decent Nvidia card as well but I dont have much insight into those.
SunTiger Massan has lethal he plays justicar and heals his 4hp face.
Why are you watching massan instead of the european qualifiers ?
THe Live Events part of TL is a blind spot to me.
So thats the pacifist run of undertale technically completed.
Technically because I dont have time to complete the post game part yet.
MairBear yo uwatching the firaxicon thing ?
Give it enough time to actually begin something.
They are talking about xcom stuff now.
And why they are doing xcom2.
Not live footage yet.
Making fun of terror from the deep.
I think Hearthstone broke on me.
This warrior's turn has been going on for 4 minutes and the rope isn't appearing.
Damn I'd won that one too c.
Holy shit xcom2 mod tools will actually just give you the raw assets to use.
No need to fucking rip the levels apart just to be able to use a chair.
Watermelon Atronachs but with XCOM assets.
Yes so not watermelons or atronachs.
I hope someone mods all the old aliens back in.
So we can have tiny sectios and big sectiods in the same fight.
Mootons are freaky ass things now.
These screenshots don't have AA set high enough.
Or mayve its the video encoding.
That soldier is missing a tooth.
Thats not a shield at all!
Now THAT is new.
SunTiger dragon hunter without a dragon I've been here too often.
MairBear yeah someimes that decks decides you don't get to win a game.
So I visited my parents today.
The TV was on as it usually is. There was some finnish comedy show on.
In this sketch one of the characters father picked up an axe and went to drive his daughter and wife out of the house into the snow.
Finnish comedy! It was actually pretty funny.
Finland you confuse me.
One day I think That'd be a nice place to live the next OH GOD I LOVE LIVING PLS NO.
Well you can't drive anywhere without a horde of elk ramming your car.
Hey we spray paint our elk to prevent that now.
But ther e are also downsides.
Not sure its spray paint.
... red wunz go fasta?
There pacifist run of undertale done.
A no trabble run.
On one screen video games on the auxiliary heroes stream and the eng-aus rugby.
The multitasking is real.
I do not understand that reference.
I'm not very far into it.
Characters from it as far as Im aware.
How far in are you noelor?
Just had my skel-date.
I thought this was lesbian detectives - why is this game set in high school? ...did you know. That schoolgirls can also be lesbians?
In fact if anime has taught me anything schools are lesbian hives.
I'm watching an archived stream of Black Closet.
Just won a game of HotS with 4/5 dead.
Dob my room's a bombsite atm so if you want to come round and watch HotS before games tomorrow bring a laptop and we'll set up in the living room >.>.
Also let me know when you're showing up.
How high is this band ?
SunTiger the correct amount.
Mad jelly at these skillz.
HOW EVEN are we queuing for twice as long as the average wait time as tank and healer.
No just Magic Crystals~.
I can only imagine this plays like Descent.
Since you recently played Long Live The Queen HuniePop.
Sure that checks out.
Due to your recent playtime in other Choices Matter games that is not a genre steam fuck off.
Also even if it were The Walking Dead wouldn't be in it.
Arcana Heart 3 Love Max!!!!! actual game name.
Is that love max as in maximum love or max as in a character ?
It's an anime thing.
So probably maximum but.
Arcana Heart 3 Love Max <- thats till fairly sane.
Compared to Under night in-birth Exe Late.
The five !s are what I was mainly looking at.
Turns out I can't convert CEST into BST on the fly.
Yeah turns out the hots eu final was starting an hr earlier than I first thought from the schedule.
GlennCuddlefish I am stuck on this stupid bridge flower puzzle -.
Oh you mean the one where you have to place 4 in a row?
And there's only space for three of them.
That took me a while to figure as well.
Have you considered consulting the sign? that wont really help but it amused me.
Dob I facebooked you.
Today I got trounced in Lords of waterdeep by my cousin and return won over him in Marvel Legendary. Woo.
The main character from the opponent's team was off sick so they couldn't do the comeback feelgood episode.
Especially for SunTiger.
The new XCOM2 floaters are certainly something.
In retrospect undertale has an amazing OST.
Certainly has my favorite boss theme in a while If you are planning on playing undertale I recommend not listening to that. It really fits the boss.
So apparently the pc version of DoA finally got online.
But of course they fuck it up by not adding lobbies.
I still think FF14 has the best AoE of any mmorpg I have played.
At least as black mage.
Season one Finale of SU reached with my dad.
He was unconvinced till about episode 10 but now asks for episodes with food.
None of those none food episodes.
I lost the cap of my whisky bottle and now I have to keep drinking #firstworldproblems.
Reminds me of the story I heard of when dad came home from a party with friends drunk as all hell. Because he and a friend lost a cap to a whiskey bottle and just had to drink it all.
That's just how whisky works yo.
My dad and his scots friend security for a plane journey. They had their hip flasks. Their contents were not allowed on board the container however was. Them both standing off to one side at security. Down the hatch.
If you watched yesterday’s episode of My Little Pony and have an opinion about whether or not it was transmisogynistic oh dear.
Not even sure I wanna know.
Apparently it was an episode where the apple brother pretends to be a girl and do a contest with Apple Bloom because Applejack is out of town. Or something.
Not sure if confused.
The dangers of anime hair.
Oh gods not those guys again.
They did one for sakura trick.
Then there's the /v/ version of healer that is too XXX rater for this chaste channel.
Well have you bullied your healer tonight then? P.
Seeing as my healer is one of my oldest friends that would be a bit too weird even for my taste D.
Apparantly the veins in the back of my eyes are squiggly when they should be straight so I need to get checked for high blood pressure.
I'm going to call it you have high blood pressure.
I assume the fact that I literally get chest pains from anxiety has contributed.
Ember i'm starting to think there really is an immortals convention.
Average wait time 11 minutes. Time expired 61 minutes 35 seconds.
Ã­ think the lfg time in that game just LIES.
Why I had no idea you had started playing WildStar p.
This is my third attempt at getting into that dungeon.
First two times tank disconnected right at start.
I like this game and all I just wish they made raids less mandatory for quest chains.
The hilibrand colosseum one.
Ah one of the new ones.
Ysengrin super judgey about hair.
He's a guy who likes girls with long hair. I can respect that.
On the phone to utilities company.
Fucking Fallout-era swing music while on hold.
Interspersed with a very loud Scottish robot lady telling me I'll be dealt with shortly.
I mean from like Edinburgh so not properly Scottish.
Wow the worst kind of scottish robot lady voice.
Comprehensible by the English is the thing.
Anyway after a while I got through to a human Scottish lady who advised me the process of setting up an account would take 20 minutes.
And I don't have that much lunch break left so.
I'll have to listen to early 20th Century music and Scottish lady robot again this evening.
At least the music isn't the worst thing ever.
Kirisu so I should be looking into transportation to Newcastle about now right?
Anathema I'd recommend it aye.
Though mainly because it's super shitty quality.
Chicago in Shadowrun got a nasty case of Insect Spirit infestation.
Wait why when I alt tab into programs and features is the windows icon handsome jack?
Cooked_Auto but is it as bad as Watch_Dogs Chicago?
2055 was a bad year for Chicago to the point its now known as Bug City.
Let's just say that Insect Spirits are not something you ever really want to meet in Shadowrun.
Sadly the english SR wikis are honestly kind of bad the German otoh are fucking astouding with how info they have.
Well okay a lot better than most English articles at least.
Hey moonwolf what do you call a cannibal who works at a traveling carnival and only eats his co-workers?
Indeed. Or as it were a carnievore.
Also I have found a question google has no answer for.
What IS the difference between a funfair and traveling carnival?
Carnivals have evil gypsies.
That sounded less racist in my head.
Steal ALL the adorable octopus plushies.
My dad has managed to install an app on his iPad.
By this I mean not only is it a fixed landscape display.
It's fixed as landscape with the iPad's only button to its left.
Regardless of the iPad's orientation.
So I just couldn't even.
Ember i'm starting to think there really is an immortals convention <- feasible.
SunTiger I hope adorable octo-slime is playable.
Also Road Hog's belly button appears to be eating a pocky.
“Sex Appeal Shirtless Men and Social Justice Diversity in Desire and Fanservice in Games” <- this sounds like a fun talk.
Also Road Hog's belly button appears to be eating a pocky <- thats just one of the folds.
It looks very different to the others.
Feels like its just angle / art.
Â€œSex Appeal Shirtless Men and Social Justice Diversity in Desire and Fanservice in Games <- thats what I have been calling for all along! Fan service for everyone.
Except for disgusting fujoshi yaoi. Fuck that. Full bara or bust tbh.
Also chainmail bikini for nobody.
The nice thing about making a salad is that you need like 2 types of vegetables and whatever else you happen to have at hand.
GlennCuttlefish is from the Kojima school of fanservice.
Althought kojima could do with making his stuff less creepy.
Tone down the creep factor.
Mental health care in the USA isn't even a clusterfuck... it's some sort of frustrating cluster-dryhump.
John Oliver is so good at simile.
Wondering if that's more a metaphor.
But it's been yrs since english.
I died in WHFRP.
Rip one armed BDSM elf.
Now I have to be some reasonably normal person.
Skelularity is imminent.
Wish this person who is supposed to be replacing my electricity meter would hurry up and arrive.
The answer isn't the hard part it's the question that's tough. So you build a bigger computer. Vaster. More skeletal. A complete ecosystem to provide an ever-growing supply of new skeletons! Unfortunately the Modrons bulldozed the Prime Material Plane to make room for a transethereal bypass mere hours before its great task was complete.
Need to work in a computational necromancer guild into OTS.
Need a name for the sword of my undead-smiting sorta-priestess-of-death lady.
A normal computer can't have each individual bit grab a club and start smacking one's enemies. The skeleton computer can.
Okay tales of xilia party.
Stop trusting the guy who has literally betrayed you ever fucking TOWN for the last 5 towns.
But he's a nice and friendly guy. How can't you trust him?
Mostly because he betrays you every fucking single time.
MoonWolf spoiler NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
Average wait time 5 minutes time in queue 65 minutes.
Final fantasy the continuing adventures of queue times that lie.
Revenge of the queue.
Good god the average wait time updated itself at some point to 18 minutes.
However I am still nearly 90 minutes in the queue.
Man playing a black mage is starting to be difficult in these dungeons.
Why is that ?
Okay so a single firespell takes about 2.5 seconds to cast.
I have to move about every 2 seconds because AOE EVERYWHERE.
Eh its not that bad. keeps things interesting.
I just wish I could do more at times.
Well you have to weave your fireballs with frostbolts right?
Isn't that how BMage in FFXV?
Well without the bolt bits i asssume.
FF doens't int bolts and balls.
And yeah blizzagae and firae.
Platinums Transformers game is out today btw.
Soundcloud shuffle gives me Do It For Her into Strong in the Real Way.
Because it has no respect for my feels.
Well that would explain why it feels a bit chilly.
Allegedly I burned 1.2k kcal today at the gym o/.
Listening to a table talk podcast attached to 6FU's Fellowship ep.
One player has low mic quality says look at all these moves.
I heard look at all these boobs >.>.
A whole flock of boobies.
So MS have inveted the holo gauntlet tool things from Mass Effect.
Look at all these boobs would make sense for say Exalted 2.
A new microsoft baaaand.
It has a barometer now o.
Also One Punch Man has started airing.
Finished ME2 and all its dlc.
Arrival was pretty weak compared to Overlord and Shadow Broker.
I get that vs bots people aren't as confident/good in HotS Vs adept or novice I want a quick win but understand if my team is bad.
Vs Elite bots... I don't expect my team to go 4 man in 1 lane and sacrficie the other two lanes.
So far ME3 is a much better game.
It starts you in cover when cutscenes end in fights.
Fucking hated that in me2.
2 meters away from cover instantly under fire.
Goddamnit ff14 stop making the lalafell cry!
They must all cry.
Because they are horrible.
They are not catgirls or elves and thusly inferior.
You shut your whore mouths.
Lalafells are the best.
And should not cry.
...Dont you fucking dare final fantasy.
I swear to gods if you pull this shit on me.
I...I am going to drop this game now. But first I am going to see.
If there is a way to murder everyone in this kingdom.
Also why is my character just standing there again I have the power to obliterate everyone in that room.
And disrupt the delicate and very intricate story that the writers want you to see? Nonsense.
The ride won't end until the game says it is and until then there is nothing you can do.
Oh there is plenty I can do. I just wont see it to the end then.
Also well done final fantasy I have finally found someone I hate more in a mmorpg than sylvanas.
Just one flare maybe two. Two tiny little flares game thats all I ask.
Nope nope and nope.
Well that was almost as good. I am still upset with this game however.
GlennCuttlefish I think I know what you mean and I had that spoiled by the godsdamned trailer C.
Haven't got that far in game myself yet.
I got it spoiled like 5 minutes before it happened in game for me when my game DC'd and the intro for HW started playing.
So yeah if any of you are going to play heavensward DO NOT WATCH THE INTRO before finishing the main story.
Deprotagonism at it's evillest c.
I wish it was possible to have the player character doing cool stuff in cutscenes but I guess that would have been a hassle to make.
Because other than that this game has amazing cutscenes at times.
Son of a bitch I did not expect to see him again.
Suddenly this game turned into metal gear.
I have been mostly watching cutscenes about since I started complaining.
A custscene to surpass Metal Gear!?!
And then hilibrand suplexed a mech.
There had better be more hilibrand in 3.0.
Or whatever the next patch is.
A lot of the cutscenes are great.
I still hate minfilia though.
There finally finished pre-heavensward content. and with half a level to spare before 52 when I actually get new skills.
Now I am not saying the sun is at an annoying position this time of the morning but I just missed my queue because I Couldn't see the prompt.
Now you just have to wait another hour V.
Nah roulettes are fairly quick.
Its just if you want a specific instance you're fucked as DPS.
Roulettes for dungeons or for those quick mini-dungeons?
Waitno I think that was for a guildhest.
I did run a dungeon afterwards.
I was a white mage so my queues were tiny.
Also hello mystery gibberish person.
Ftrbzzs is my friend from work.
And I play many many games.
Pleasure to be here -.
Fuck I'm out of black tea.
Oh man I might actually have to go buy groceries today I'm out of milk.
And while salty coffee is fine for a coffee break or two this just will not do.
Hopefully its warmer than yesterday.
It's above 0 that's still plenty warm -.
The teabags in the kitchen are dreadful.
At least there's good coffee!
My work pc needs more RAM 12GB is not enough when Oracle is gonna steal 4GB for no bloody reason.
RONSOMANIA IS RUNNIN' WILD BROTHER.
!note Noelor called it called it. totally called it.
So that was great. Finally got instance queue to pop up and my net dies.
Are we is game.
MoonWolf we did chargen for Star Wars yesterday.
Are you a jedi ?
What are we playing today and should I level up something?
Star Wars doesn't have much in the way of weird elementals or sentient botany.
So I'm a Gand.
Minister you could be a droid?
Anathema I'm robots in the same group's upcoming Numanumanera.
My Gand is friends with the group's droid though.
And did we get an advance or level last time?
Who is an ex-assassin HK-like droid turned pilot.
Also my Gand hasn't earned a name yet.
So half the character info fields just say Gand.
GlennCuttlefish you should be level 4.
Gand are lungless insectoid people who refer to themselves in the third person.
Does that mean you can't drown?
Though vacuums are still bad for me for other reasons.
Yeah because not having to breathe in space would be OP.
Well I don't have to breathe in space.
Minister Newcastle Central train station for yours aye?
But my chitin is not up to that sort of pressure.
2 changes from Glasgow wtf.
But my chitin is not up to that sort of pressure <- thats now how space works.
Well w/e I haven't looked at the be in space rules.
But of the many dangers that feat includes.
I am only immune to suffocation.
You doing specifically Queen St or summat?
Like I can believe two changes from Milngavie but not Glasgow.
Have to go to Edinburgh first.
MoonWolf level 4 with no advances?
Like even a direct train between Newcastle and Glasgow centrals has a long stop in Waverley.
>over Â£100 to get a train from Newcastle to Cambridge.
Two changes also probably?
Easyjet don't do any newcastle -> london flights.
They only do 3 uk ones bristol belfast and jersey p.
Probably cheaper to get a train back to Glasgow and fly from there.
Why are trains so damn expensive in this country.
People expect them to be.
Also all the infrastructure is old so some portion is actually being redirected to piecemeal modernisation.
And/or maintenance required as a result of running modern trains on 19th-century tracks.
There's a direct crosscountry from glasgow central -> Newcastle according to google...
National rails journey planner doesn't go into january...
Ah it only does 12 weeks in advance.
I was going to say.
3 months doesn't seem too bad.
Well I can book my flight to glasgow and my train to newcastle just now at least.
Is when I'll arrive.
Anathema an then january holiday in Finland!
Ftrbzzs maybe march or april.
But why would anyone come to finland out of their own free will.
What else do you need?
Above freezing temperatures 7 months of the year?
Pretty sure that's covered by saunas.
Not really viable for 7 months in a row. Also speaking of which I'm late for one. Try not to cancel the game while I am gone.
I might delay the game a little?
Depends what traffic's like on the way home.
But I have to phone the electric company to set up an account so I'll have power straight away upon moving into my flat.
Ftrbzzs RE earlier also this.
MoonWolf this new brawl seems amusing.
Oh i should check that.
If you have a 1 mana card you will draw it on turn 1 if 2 mana turn 2 and so on.
MairBear id you know that if you play dragon priest with a guartenteed good curve.
You murder the opposition ?
Becuase i know do.
I just won with recurved secret mage.
That would be hilarious though.
MairBear how my mathc ended.
I dropped a chromaggus on 8 got my yseras duplicated on 9 then played those one after the other then played my confessor.
Huh now I've walked through a small storm once but that's some heavy winds.
Worst i've had was wind i couldn't bike into.
Never wind i could almost not walk into.
Been pretty windy here past two days but nothing that bad.
Minister they just saw each other again and she almost fell into poppy's motherly embrace. If only it weren't for that meddling friedrich.
Oh boy I cant wait to hit 60 and then have to re-learn my class.
You got Heavensward then?
Yeah got it a week or so ago when my friend hit 50.
Havent touched HW content yet since he is still on pre-HW story.
As someone who finished the story could I bother you for basic advice on what to run or where to go to get my item level up for story shizzle?
How far in the story are you.
Because at one point in main story they just dole out ilevel 110 stuff.
My last duty was to go to Snowcloak.
Lacking like 5 item levels x.
Have you been getting poetics yet?
Or are you below level 50?
Yeah before I quit I was foraying into Crystal Tower and stuff. I just wondered if those placer or the Coil's of Bahamut had still got the population to be worth the queue times. Or if I should just do dungeons to unlock hard dungeons. And then do them.
Fairly sure you can buy some decent gear for about 400 poetics.
As someone who dealt with long DPS queues what would you personally advise for Poetics?
GlennCuttlefish literally what happened yes.
Well finally time to make that goddamn salmon pie. Even if I did forget the rucola. and am not sure if the cheese I have is still usable.
Also one of the salmon packs is nearing the expiration date. But only nearing so that should be fine.
Britsh Punisher? Really? v.
He's like the punisher.
Apparently he uses gelrounds v.
Im more amazed he has a gun.
The Collector and his evil Janitor?
A Glaidator joke? Really now?
Evil Janitor you say?
Yeah looks pretty evil to me.
These GUI changes in HotS.
Wait gui changes ?
When di this happen ?
An extremely balanced card.
As a suprrise to nobody my food experiment is taking a bit longer than expected.
Noelor is late right.
All right gonna turbho chop and megamix stuff.
Just food your food.
I was too late to do the thing that would have taken long enough to make me late for this.
Afk for...10-15 minutes hopefully.
MairBear is still missing anyway.
The creepiest gif.
Its now ni preparation limbo.
For 40 minutes or so.
Narrator Before the break Mitsuru was being tsundere... Harem protag I couldn't believe how tsundere Misturu was being! Let's be honest who makes a guy lunch if they *don't* like him?
Why is the undertale OST so good.
Indie does not automatically mean good.
I wouldn't really compare the two. Bastion is technically better but undertale is just more...Fun.
Just meant for the good ost =P.
I was talking about the OST's.
Overall undertale imo is easily better.
Bastion songs are in a weird tuning.
Frontier funk step or whatever it was called.
Mfw when seeing my rolls.
Noelor weird because it has a 4th in it and because it strains the neck because of how different it is from standard.
That's what I was told when I brought it up with my tutor.
I'll pretend I understand any of that gibberish and just say YEs.
Like the concept that music can be so weird it damages the wooden part of a guitar.
Makes me what so hard.
Noelor because of the tension in the strings they are designed around the standard tuning.
MoonWolf Noelor MairBear.
I saw it on th elivestream but yes its cool.
You never even see her ass!
Unless you browse 4chan.
Or certain tags elsewhere.
This man is a legend.
Guess this pie turned out alright.
But its more of a your whole family is coming over to celebrate something sort of pie instead of a honest dinner pie.
Shaman forms at the bottom.
And this is why you don't discuss politics in a guild chat... Someone disagreed with an officer different opinon and got repeatedly told to stop trolling.
Slightly annoyed with new team member today. I'm sure I've made equally stupid mistakes before but another team keeps using every little issue as an excuse not to do work.
OTOH I have more tea.
And my migrations app works with oracle \o/.
Anathema quite interesting haven't heard of that one before.
I know the fine chaff from the roasting machines can be an issue.
Ftrbzzs the game.
Anathema looks very cool.
Yet more things I need to paint.
Ignore mess in on the side chat made new macros and checked they worked.
You know when QI posts things that just seem untrue?
No but go on.
Yeah you can go look at a study or 60 that details the exact chemicals involved in the breakdown of alochol the effect of alcohol on sleep rythms and dehydration etc.
Oestreicher just means Austrian right?
I am seeing it as a family name.
Nationalities always strike me as boring options there.
The most interesting feature of one of my ancestors is that he was from a place.
Though I guess family names in general are kinda weird.
Family names are an endless source of entertainment and bewliderment.
So are weird some are hilarious some or just so common as to be useless.
Do you live in Amsterdam or close by?
My surname means strong when translated from... One or more of the Scandinavian tongues Swedish let's say.
My paternal family line has been in the English Midlands for a couple centuries.
There's also a place or at least a landmark in Scotland of the same name.
No idea if it's connected.
If your parental line has been in England since vikings then you have vikings.
Also you're surname stark?
I didn't mean strong.
If from swedish that'd be more akin to big.
I meant that yes.
It doesn't mean anything else in any extant language but it goes back far enough that's meaningless.
Though reading it from a few centuries ago big would be strong.
Sounds like a cool jutsu.
Open plan offices are the worst fad.
MoonWolf Truly this is the new great mystery.
Shouting each other into submission.
Kinda impressive that the newest Witcher 3 patch has 600 fixes.
Kinda sad it needed 600 of them.
Meanwhile most other developers would've stopped patching their game by now =p.
No MoonWolf whats sad is that you're allowed to release tony hawk 5 while stripping all content to pass a certification and then pass it in and it still being broken what's awesome is that a large developer now actually cares about their game 5 months later.
And isn't focused on hats.
Back in my hole.
ChaosSmurf my kingdom death monster arrived.
ChaosSmurf howdy I am indeed a friend of anathema.
Anathema yeah a mate's did too.
No idea when we'll have time to play it.
Or room it's hueg.
Mitsubishi's must be fast. They're hedgehog endorsed.
Why is ana's friend's name an onomatopoeia?
Just for the buzz.
I have so many questions about that hedgehog.
Is its name prickles?
The captioned one is best.
Did I ever link this here.
Also you don't even know most of these waifus ChaosSmurf.
All of these waifus are shit.
Following our heroâ€™s debut adventure in this summerâ€™s â€œAnt-Manâ€ Scott Lang will return alongside Hope Van Dyne on July 6 2018 with Marvelâ€™s â€œAnt-Man and the Wasp.â€ toot.
Well I certainly did not expect this track in the MGSV OST.
MoonWolf shut up I like teh music and flashing lights.
Quest is diablo heroes.
Only rotation diablo hero is Azmodan.
Overwatch beta is probably next week btw.
Names and bnet addresses are being sent off on Monday.
Naturally I'm in London Tuesday Wednesday.
I suspect it'll be friday or saturday ?
MoonWolf I'd assume it would be when the Blizzard servers reboot.
Also chance this guy's going to Riot about 9 in 10.
That link does not work for me.
But if he worked for Blizzard and now doesn't yes.
MoonWolf I will commence moving on the 21st.
And I might end up here in the evening but I'd rather it not be relied upon.
Hmm that was certainly an expected image to see when trying to access the SA forums v.
Haha what the fuck happened.
I wish I knew.
Steam I updated you yesterday what is even your deal.
Critical issue I guess.
I just glimpsed the word waifuism.
I've had it once where days on end it looked like it wanted to keep reinstalling the same update.
!note Mairnai HS in tabletop simulator.
Seems... kind of pointless but neat.
But how big are the cards.
I like how steam says that Broadcasts are a new thing v.
I wish there was a steam sale soon so I could actually consider picking up TTS.
Yeah I guess thats soon.
I wish I had enough upload for broadcasting.
Go figure if the tabletop sim will get a decent percentage off during that point.
Ehh. Still warm enough to sleep with the window open.
Todays song is.
MoonWolf seen this non-final Blizzcon schedule?
Whats the deal with it ?
No WoW movie panel.
Just deve talk on diablo for an hour.
So thats basically just an extended QA.
Also i'm not seeing serious gaps they could sneak spoilery panels in.
I can't imagine they think they're going to get away with being a WoW blizzcon.
After they already announced teh expansion and quite a lot of what's in it.
I mean maybe they don't give a fuck.
This might be a very disappointing blizzcon.
Suddenly a playable race!
With the expansion out the next day.
Like what are you doing.
They just went to last year's links.
So it's possible it'll get changed.
So much for my D3 expansion thoughts though.
Thought it was guaranteed.
Its just going to be SC and overwatch are out now.
Lets talk about that i guess ?
Probably a Hearthstone adventure tho.
I mean you've gotta say something in that first hour.
Does Overwatch have a release date yet?
Somewhere this month i believe ?
But this is not a game where beta to release actually matters.
E-mail addresses of press etc that want access get sent off Monday.
Is hots released? or beta?
Yeah the only big moment will be when they turn the corner on key availability.
Released not that you'd know.
Basically every MOBA has existed in its beta state and transitioned to release.
I didn't like it.
In a way that nobody cares about except the marketing department.
It's interesting that it works.
I think it's because of how you need a good number of players.
Once per encounter Dr Doom can give another character PC or NPC the ability to say his name in a very stylized way.
I hope the enxt Mass Effect game has music and atmosphere as good as the first one.
Tbh Steven isn't *really* a pacifist.
Minor spoilers for today's ep.
Giant robots shouldn't fight!
I mean come on now.
It's a shame Ember's dead.
To be fair there are few things more inscrutable than Jenna Moran making set theory jokes. Yeah this is fair.
If ever there was a better motivation to learn maths I do not know it.
Minister I feel I have formed some kind of spiritual bond with Kit after the latest poppy.
I am two weeks behind on SU now O.
Anathema stop being such a clod.
GlennCuttlefish yeah if that panel isn't already in your reaction.jpg folder.
It'd be like I don't even know you.
Ember some serious pearl gemish going on here.
MoonWolf yeah it's great.
Noelor Steven seems to have missed the central point of giant robots.
Man I wish I had a pretty face and shitty taste in videogames.
Instead you have a terrible face and a terrible taste in games? =p.
Bitch my taste is amazing.
Shame the same cant be said about your face. p.
There we go.
This will prove useful.
Well yes which is why I didn't bring it up.
I mean if I went on a rigorous diet for a few years my face might be passable but.
Oh and fixed that one tooth.
Clearly you'd be fine if you skipped the webcamera.
Sadly that doesn't sell as well. Also damn right I would I have that exotic accent that drives british girls wild.
Disclaimer My sample size for this claim is 1.
That reminds me we didn't even watch SU this week.
Guess I will have to do it now.
Something tells me that whoever was cleaning up the oven did not finish the job properly.
Mainly that the whole house now stinks of whatever was used to clean it.
Vs same scene but English and German dubbs.
Don't see any problems there.
Well those subtitles did not help.
I can tell you that.
For SU people.
MoonWolf are you watching cards?
Should i be ?
I think it's just started.
At least in the grand shcme of matches.
MairBear i almost don't recognize cleaned up reynad by his face.
He's not usually that bad.
That was a finish.
Spellslinger into tracking into fireball.
You can't really account for that.
Small consolation that Trump didn't throw the game by leaving the slinger.
Doens't he know its Brian Don't call me Brian.
Doens't he know its Brian Don't call me Brian 'Brian Kibler from Brian Kibler Gaming' Kibler Kibler.
I'm trying to run a serious inquisition here and someone in my fortress has starting a music group called the sing-quisition.
For some reason this expansion has an all new VA cast.
Well my coconut chicken curry hit a slight bump in the road when I noticed that I in fact did not have any coconut milk.
Everything else was on the pan.
That is a problem.
So I improvised by adding some cinnamon and then using unflavored yoghurt instead.
Hope it turned out okay.
It turned out very good actually.
Oh and decided to use pickled ginger instead of fresh ginger.
Since I didn't have any lemon either.
Does... that even exist?
Oh no I have to play twice as many games.
So you remember how I complained about only getting ifrit as my tank roulette a while back.
I finally got back into leveling that character roulette up.
So I figured out what the hell one more try.
In todays DD game we have debated if we should make Gori-san our giant ape a mayoral candidate for westgage.
And once again the DM was too obtuse to figure out what the players wanted.
If i can't figure out what you want i just ask what you want to do.
Its not rocket science.
So apparently they're now planning to make a tv-series of one of GRRMs other books.
Cooked_Auto which other books ?
MoonWolf what do you think the next adventure will be.
Just one Skin Trade.
Cause I just saw someone mention AQ.
And that'd be fucking rad.
Which he apparently wrote in 88 so it feels like they're reaching a bit.
I'm hoping Kharazan. But AQ Kharazan or that troll one seem about equally likely in my book.
The 10 man one.
Did they change it to 10 man.
Zul'Gurub was the 25 man one in Vanilla.
That was the other one.
But I've never done it.
Maybe just the Troll raids in general.
Its great you missed out.
If you like 10 mans anyway.
I prefer 10 mans.
I like 10 mans a lot.
But haven't had 9 mates to play WoW with in a long time.
So neer got to do the hard ones.
Debating streaming doom for a couple of hours.
I did it back with cads guild.
When half the guild literally lived in cads house.
I'm watching HS americas championship.
Also incidentally HS is beating every other stream on twitch right now.
Beating lol by about 20%.
But yeah HS is huge.
Turns out install base is all that really matters for e-sports viewership.
Which could prove a problem.
Thats not exactly true ?
HS became an esport before/while it was growing.
I mean as in how it scales.
Gotta think longterm here expand before there is a market.
I.e. the quality of the game doesn't matter for the viewership it just matters how many people have it installed.
Cooked_Auto they were not thinking longterm not in that way.
Obv a bad game is unlikely to get a big install base.
HS as a popular esport just sort of happened.
Because blizzard is incapable of planning for its own succes.
But a paid-for game is unlikely too.
They've handled this a lot better than SC.
Or was it all a masterplan hidden in them playing dumb? tinfoil.
Obv they have experiences from fucking SC.
ChaosSmurf sure but they didn't make it happen they started supporting it after it started.
Oh you should never make it happen.
Our cardgame seems to be exploding also people really seem to like that Fight Night thing.
Based on past events you should never make it happen.
Oh god what.
MoonWolf getting the dwarf guy to say the players names.
Has made me so angry.
What a thing to be angry about.
I hope they attach that to their accounts dota2 style.
So anytime they join a game dwarf guy announces them instead of the hero.
Also is Dangermouse actually good?
Noelor Sadly black.
Those are not the right planetary symbols.
Mainly just orientation though.
Ie Mercury and Venus upside down Mars too vertical.
Those are impotant differences.
And don't even get me started about how the circles are hearts i don't care how canon it is.
It is acceptable only in the context of Sailor Moon.
Also fans of good anime.
Oenpunch man 2 is out.
Opens with saitama trying to zwee-fight a single mosquito.
Well that was an episode of Watch_Dogs.
MoonWolf the game of Hearthstone I just won.
The nut perfect 1 in however many minions there are twice off portal.
Then succubus off shredder.
Then perfect dr boom bombs.
Rngesus was on your side.
MoonWolf he seriously got a dragonkin deal-3-damage from a portal and it had synergy.
Then I got the 3/5 that silences all your minions.
After he'd frozen one of my minions.
*my only other minion.
Then MoonWolf got Gorehowl and Deathwing out of the pack it won him.
You didn't have a gore howld yet ?
I keep winning games after not tabbing back in in time to mulligan too.
I'm so good is what I'm saying.
Imagine how good you could be if you actually tried.
Alright I lost that one.
MairBear got my quest.
I'm gonna stop now.
I want to have luck left for anything else I ever do.
This is what you get for Out-of-Bounds-ing Aiden.
But you knew I'd say that.
Less flippantly depends when in SU's run we're talking.
Early S1 is the sort of thing Chuubo's aimed at iirc.
Also since music seems to be a huge part of the show maybe there can be bonuses given if a player sings something? yes.
This rule seems great if you want to inflict horrible singing on your group.
Not so much otherwise.
MoonWolf still got quest?
Lemme quit this sec.
Bring on the winning.
Yeah all the mass murders existencial crisis pondering about what is death and why does it happen and fleeing from mass destruction all the time makes IX a really light hearted game. it really does though!
But not because of those reasons.
Man yuru's are intensifying this season.
Twitch Plays Pokemon Colosseum has just started.
They immediately proceeded to skip going for the campaign and have gone for a quick battle mode.
This is labelled as giant bees but I disagree.
Noelor lava bees ?
If i was big boss i'd get my rd department to build me a building fulton.
That might be an issue though since space is kinda premium on MB.
That is exactly why he should fulton more of it!
Yeah if he could fulton buildings MB could be bigger!
I just Canine Leather from a hyena in DAI and it annoys me.
Their skin is similar enough to those of dogs for tanners' needs?
Yay new words.
2 support 2 specialist Naz and Murky and me as assassin.
Yeah this'll be a quick game for my daily -_-.
Hah Tales of Zestria is Steams #1 top seller right now.
The good news is the wedding worked. We got the intended result! so positive!
But why would people be hyped for zestiria?
Like it seems like the worst games so far.
Well not the worst but far from the best.
I just got to the moment o.
I knew it was coming.
FFXIV But it still hit.
Punched in the feelings by dragons ?
GlennCuttlefish I knew that first thing was happening...
I did not expect a GRR Martin finish.
I'm sure its fine.
Also prepare for a sudden case of EVERYONE'S BRITISH WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VA'S?
If you are playing with english voices.
.....all of the VAs?
I hated his voice at first but I've grown accustomed to it this is gonna be weird.
GlennCuttlefish so I googled the caravan doods name in case it was more than coincidence probably still is but I was rewarded with this ...
Well few are the men who can resist the allure of that sweet sweet potato booty.
Round two of hope you have time for many cutscenes.
Not in an mmo.
The credit roll is reminding me...
We have way too many antagonists still breathing.
<- what is even ging on.
As far as I can tell they are casting many spells back to back and spamming outfit changes.
Thats a thing you can spam ?
Yeah irrc you can also do it in WoW just set up gear sets and drag em onto a hotbar.
One of my players had his arm shot off with autogun fire last night right at the beginning and didn't get to do much else that session I felt kinda bad.
At least you didn't accidentally kill them.
I was focus firing noelor last TGAO session in an attempt to burn some recoveries with the las tfew monsters.
He'd already be dead if it weren't for fate points.
He does have a bad habit of standing in front of people aren't with full-auto weapons who then proceed to get lucky attack rolls.
I assume you meant armed and not aren't.
Not had my tea yet.
The tech-priest is slowly gaining corruption from is archaetech obsession.
He is carrying around a mysterious frictionless orb and used it to shatter the power and mind of a pysker last night she turned her body into fire sadly it also momentarily cracked the veil between the warp and the material so everyone is a bit freaked out right now someone even jumped out a window.
You broke the barrier between worlds.
And the worst that happened is someone jumped out a window.
Where was the horrible shrieking nightmare demons ?
It only broke the barrier for an instant and the nightmare demons were held back by the anti-warp orb.
They cut out the eyes of the psyker for some reason.
And they know she has divination powers not like she needs eyes to see...
Is there a divination power that just gives you day to day not run into walls use ?
Dunno but there is always the risk of brain-eating in psychic powers.
The least canon couple triad. whatever.
I like my other rpg group we havent even moved over to Shadowrun Africa and we're already planning to run a DD5 game set in Ravinica after that v.
This feels accurate.
MoonWolf what do we think.
Beta after the broadcast on Thursday.
ChaosSmurf i don't believe a word you are saying about beta announements.
You are always wrong.
So let's say friday.
How am I always wrong.
Nah Beta announcement at blizzcon opening ceremony.
I said something would happen this week.
You said it would happen today.
You betrayed me ChaosSmurf.
It'll either be the punchline of the ceremony or one of the highlights.
I'm 600 miles from my computer.
Why are you in london this time?
Anathema Games Media Awards.
The amount of salt on SA about Ex3 is amusing to me.
SA is basically nothing but salt.
You can't spell salt without SA.
What are they annoyed about.
Ex3 has been editing its pagexx references.
For 3 weeks now.
Holden and Maria their project art director have been replacing all the page xx references with actual numbers.
The goons all being professional publishers are incensed that this could take longer than a day.
It's 700+ pages I think?
I took the bait here I see.
I've done insane grunt work.
It does take longer than it seems it will though.
But 3 weeks ?
This week's update included paraphrasing Holden has advised that it took longer than expected on account of he has OCD.
Also thanks for the writing prompt ChaosSmurf I'll use that later.
Man Exalted 3's going to need to be fucking.
A+ tits to live up to expectations.
Taken FAR too long now.
ChaosSmurf eh it still has two months left before it is later than Kingdom Death p.
What is the current estimated release date anyway.
The money must have ran out so long ago.
They stopped pretending a year or more ago.
I am amazed they haven't had a backer scandal.
Well they aren't being paid a salary for the writing anyway.
What does that have to do with deliveirng your promised kickstarter on time anathema ?
All the KS money is going on art and printing the books + whatever other stretch goals there were.
If i ask you for 10 bucks to get you a mcdonalds meal.
And you say its been 2 days where is my food.
And i say well you're only giving me the money to buy it not paying me to get it.
Does that make any sense ?
Yes. However that would also make you a douchebag.
MoonWolf it means they have an incentive to get the book out early so the fact that they aren't and are taking their time to make it really good shouldn't be controversial.
There is a difference between sorry we're going to have to delay for a few months because some of this is not good enough.
And sorry we intentionally lied about when we could deliver then we threw our material out because it was bad and rewrote the whole thing and then we still don't know how to explain the last year.
As a software developer you should know how difficult it is to give accurate estimates for large projects which basically involve doing things neither you nor anyone else have done before.
And then hatewheel nearly died at least twice.
Eg I have literally doubled the estimate I gave for something and it still took longer than I said p.
I'm not clamoring for my money back either.
But there have been so many cockups on this project time wise.
I'm just surprised the general idiots aren't.
Particularly after the amount of drama.
ChaosSmurf some guy is.
With PoH and such forth.
I thought you guys were working for a professional book publisher.
And following the full doc leak only Holden hatewheel and Maria have even been allowed to look at it.
ChaosSmurf he is blaming the fact that this year he can't pay his rent on a kickstarter from over 3 years ago p.
How much did he put in.
Anathema that guy... what ?
This is why I stayed in #exalted its great.
I put Â£50 into that Eve book and it was probably a mistake.
How would the kickstarter having finished on time have changed your money situation at all.
It wouldn't thats not how money works.
They are not keeping it in reserve for you to get back with the book.
This isn't being funded on interest.
That'd be pretty good tho eh.
MoonWolf Star Citizen probably could though p.
Anathema fuck no they operate 3 game studios they are burning money quite rapidly.
Maybe if star citizens budget was used to make elite dangerous.
So hang on are they actually not paying them.
That might work out.
ChaosSmurf the majority of that money went to onyx path publisher.
They will get payed fixed money per word at a shit rate by industry standards.
ChaosSmurf the devs are contracters they are paid once the book ships IIRC from what Holden has said.
The rpg writing industry is SHIT.
When the book is out.
Holden and hatewheel as far as we know will only be paid after the book is published.
They will also see no money for any actual sales past the kickstarter.
Don't work in the rpg industry it sucks.
Wish I'd gotten the gold plated book now.
So if anyone can say they're unable to pay rent due to the delays.
I would have shat it out in a year.
It is hH not the backers.
MoonWolf unrelated other than that ChaosSmurf mentioned Kingdom Death.
Dan Shive has changed his sketchbook Patreon tier to the much more honest pinups.
The subjects of which will be decided by backer votes.
In return he should make at least one classical pinup.
Except the first one each month will be decided by him.
Is there a i will make a triad canon tier ?
This is so that he ever gets to draw dudes.
Have you guys ever looked at how much porn there is on patreon.
So much porn on patreon.
Shive's stuff is hardly porn.
There's a lot of other porn on patreon.
ChaosSmurf yes but also this won't be it.
It makes good dolla too.
Even the really shit stuff.
I may or may not have two Patreon accounts >.>.
I'd probably sub to InCase's if I had more money than sense.
<- this most recently porny sketchbook entry features intense cuddeling action.
But there's like 30 people I would put money towards the writing of before some porn.
ChaosSmurf chances are at least one of those people also writes porn on some level.
You guys patreon a lot huh?
$14 a month atm.
Have the money to patreon.
$1 per episode for Crate And Crowbar and $10 a month for VG.
Had to cut back for house ?
I actually cut it all when I decided to buy a flat to trickle into deposit savings.
I also used to give Cobbett $10 a month but $$$.
ChaosSmurf how do i get to NSFW patreon ?
He's a games journalist who looks like David Mitchell.
I dunno I find it through the artist's pages.
And then you'll get related items.
I wonder if Ganassa has one.
My uncle's house has the parental filter turned on on the internet.
ChaosSmurf you have an ssh connection to a server figure out how to tunnel.
Wasteland 2 EE came out today.
Decide to try it.
I guess not then.
Anathema don't give me that shit.
So far I have successfully sat in my pants.
I'm going to Croydon.
Not Cambridge I know how it is.
Who eve named a place croydon.
It sounds like it's a shit hole.
MoonWolf play GW2 again the expansion is out in like 10 days.
Nope fuck mmo s.
MoonWolf that seems like a pretty good reason to avoid anywhere.
Yeah but how many other places do you knwo that are full of old buzzsaws and gravity guns.
I thought that was glasss ?
How many pages is the fate core rulebook?
The whole fate core book is 300 odd pages.
I wouldn't be surprised if it's double digits.
A lot of that isn't rules.
Oh wait no I'm thinking accelerated.
MoonWolf fate has a setting?
Which is defs double digits.
Anathema I think it has a lot of guidelines.
A lot of that book is about how you should cutomize fate for your prefernces.
Because of how secretly crunchy it is.
How you could do that how to get your players involved.
If you want a Fate Core just the rules of how to play extract.
It would be a few a4's.
Basically it isn't a lightweight systme is what I'm getting at.
No thats fate accelerated.
Which is 50 pages.
And even then is a lot gm advice and shit.
I think ChaosSmurf is liveblogging shitty london on twitter.
ChaosSmurf I wonder if Ganassa has one - Pretty sure he does a lot of proffessinal stuff aside from doing stuff from at least one paysite.
The first boneputer network required the design and implementation of the Undead Datagram Protocol. It was not until the invention of the Bulletin Bone System however that the sharing of arcane information became a widespread practice in the wizard community which later led to what we today know as the World Wight Web. teehee.
!note MairBear they did it they nerfed patron warrior. INTO THE GROUND.
Ah yes the well respected japanese minister of Lucha Libre.
Well Japanese Wrestling more.
That's not a full face mask anyway.
I am perfectly okay with this player housing in-joke being made an IRL cash sink.
I was about to get irrationally angry over internet but then that wasn't what I expected.
At least its not a rarest pepe joke there =p.
Well things certainly are happening in gravity falls again.
Are they going to be happening faster than steven universe episodes ?
Why must you taunt me so?
Because you make puns.
Everyone get out of here?
Read one thing on poly apparently it literally makes it a weaker version of raid leader.
Same mana equal x/x weaker effect.
How do I explain moe bullshit to a friend?
Anathema why do you need to explain moe bullshit to your friend?
Simple the answer is.
GlennCuttlefish to explain why modern anime is bad.
Ehh. not everything moeblob is bad.
Sure it doesn't lend itself to the style of anime that was around in the 80's and 90's but.
Please get better speeds.
MairBear sure it isnt youre middle-of-nowhere internet?
Anathema yeah steam still gets around 1.5 mb/s.
Launcher is getting .23.
Probably hosting this on a phone.
Meanwhile I'm able to stream hearthstone streams without it affecting the speed.
Though I am getting tired of every donation to the host asking what they think of the warsong commander nerf.
Possibly even more tired than the hosts are of answering.
I know the awnser.
They are happy that blizzard did something they dislike that they nerfed it so hard the deck no longer exists and they hate how useless they made the new warsong commander.
If they wanted to go this route they should have made either the commander body or the bonus better.
Or the cost lower.
TOmorrow they announce new adventure.
Also I think it was a kibler deck but did you see the hob-goblin + Bolster warrior? It was hilarious to watch.
I saw some of those matches live.
It wasn't very consitent but when it won it was great.
Double also latest rage-orc had an awesome OTK bouncing blade.
Protip never give acolyte of pain all the priest health buffing cards vs warrior.
Good hp to -15 in one turn.
!hs acolyte of pain.
It feels like it has to have been staged. But it was a ladder match so idk.
Had this stuck in my head while cycling home yesterday because people behind me at work where whistling the original song.
Just really good/bad luck.
Moogles are hiccups given form.
No Noelor at all O.
Man I wanna play Changeling The Lost.
Maybe I should run a one-shot for Halloween.
I said I'm going for lunch half an hour ago.
Have only just gotten away from work and outside.
Also it's cold out here.
I wish I'd brought my coat.
I don't suppose anyone understands why ChaosSmurf's Twitter persona has the attribute cannot poop properly?
Oh good I left a typo in that !note.
Whatever this game is.
It looks RAD AS BALLS.
This is also rad.
Oh cool Rexxar's finally made it into rotation.
Thanks me from 11 hours ago.
Past you is very helpful.
Linking cool pics for me to save onto my hard drive.
Cooked_Auto who even needs a forge.
Low budget BBEG.
Noelor i think i needed to do something to herithia before the game.
But i can't remember what.
>region locking in 2015.
MoonWolf this new brawl.
Have not looked at it yet.
What is it ?
Enemy hunter's turn 3 Gahzrilla Highmane Deathrattle.
Your deck is random.
And every turn the mana cost of your cards is random.
Ah where is new pog image ?
Uh it was one of the ones you had in the folder.
I've now forgotten which.
Yeah let's go with 3.
Glenn having already taken actually the best one.
Now I like the other PCs have no nameplate.
Yes we'll have to just remember your name.
It'll be difficult but i think as a group we can pull through.
It'll be in chat.
Spice doesn't let you fold spacetime or predict the future.
Just gives you the power to ruin sandwich shops.
Alaska is a long way from Florida.
So maybe she did fold spacetime.
Kansas man is NOT a smart man.
Also quite possibly dead.
Lets fight below the stage.
On top of thes tage is so 1990's.
That's a lot of resetting of only one aerial B move before landing...
Dob Foxco's side-B is really good horizontal midair travel.
Sure just my recollection was most B moves only fire-able once while airborne and then you're left with freefall control.
Except I guess the dashes reset it in melee or something?
Sure I'd ship it. vOv.
The last joke in this scene still cracks me up so good.
That word doesn't work that way.
Schadenfreude isn't about misfortune you inflicted.
Surely schadenfreude is a superset of sadism?
Don't ruin the joke MoonWolf |.
Maybe if that show had better jokes.
I wouldn't have to point out they were bad.
Maybe you shouldn't hate fun |.
I'm gonna go make up puns and have a good time.
Feels dirty want to copy some code because referencing the project its in would bring in about 20 dependencies its just one file that makes it OK right?
Stretch finished WITHOUT a relationship.
Stretch was a manga about two girl roommates and their daily lives and also stretching.
And they started flirting pretty seriously last volume.
But now it just ended with both of them moving to different places.
No relationship at all.
And also stretching wat.
Nah just streching no yoga.
Dunno if they allow dynasty-scans at work.
I have a proxy.
I need to stretch more.
All the necromancers log their interesting exchanges on the Interskeleton Relay Communication on bludgeon.argh.
I've been writing html at work.
Is the convention or ?
Just or if you want to be really technical.
I think that last one is technically no longer correct since html5.
Why is the / at the end? >.>.
Minister self closing paired tag.
Technically html tags mark up text.
So they tell browsers to do stuff to the text they surround.
But only inserts a break it does not surround text.
Now no actual practical case cares if you or or.
But is the notation for a tag that closes itself doe snot surround the text.
Not all empty tags can be self-closed though.
In practice you'll see single or i don't care to look at the actual documentation to see which is most correct i think the regular one is.
Is the correct one.
Is the more correct form in html5 otherwise is.
I obviously had to look up some stuff.
For instance everything table-related.
The table is why I was html'ing in the first place.
If you ever marque anything i will waste my last money to come to britain to punch you.
Minister instead of.
To both what MoonWolf said and what I linked.
Does your text even lift?
My text tells people we're cutting their salary as payment for petrol.
Didn't have any italics.
What's underline supposed to be?
A with CSS styling the contents.
Haven't been to the gym this week and my back hurts.
Ftrbzzs may not make the pub.
Will take all the painkillers I can take at once once I get a cuppa.
Oh damn you sick?
Being large and sturdy sucks sometimes I never get a buzz off of the small amount of codeine in the over-the-counter painkillers.
I really hope that roll and that statement were unconnected.
Roll was to determine what restaurant I'm having dinner in on Saturday.
Hmm big boom outside just now.
Not sure if guy fawkes three weeks early or actual war.
Table th td {border none}.
This website says commas.
Commas to apply it to all table all th and all td elements no commas to only apply it to td elements inside th elements inside table elements.
...I don't think td elements can be inside th elements?
But also I want it applied to all of them anyway.
You could have another table inside your th.
...I don't think td elements can be inside th elements? <- while that may not make sense you the browser will try ANYWAY.
Because browsers don't try to render what makes sense.
They try to rende ras much as possible.
Because otherwise most sites would just break.
And I can put my align inside the same braces separated by semicolons?
If you declare the doctype as html5 they all follow the same algorithm for dealing with bad content.
Are you writing html emails?
And scrapping this project.
Because it was the wrong solution in the first place.
Its good you realized that and stopped in.
Intsead of pushing through anyway.
I still think I *could* do it all in vba.
It's basically done in fact.
I realised that what I'm doing is manually creating a tool that is mail merge.
And mail merge exists already.
It's just in Word instead of Excel.
Don't know what that is but i'm sure its useful.
Time to watch SU.
With your vision spheres.
Oh god who gave peridot a tape recordr.
MoonWolf mail merge is basically take this template and this list of contact details and generate a message for each contact.
Mass email template mailing.
Got a link to SU since I am not seeing friends today?
Today is casual Friday.
There is a man wearing a Dutch sports top.
Wtf is a dutch sports.
We have like 5 dumb sports.
I can tell because he's so orange I can spot him from the other side of the building out of the corner of my eye.
I was going to list the dumb sports only we have.
But orange works too.
And on closer inspection his chest has the relevant flag and lion on it.
Our sports colour is the best sports colour.
I'm not even saying that out of patriotism.
You see a section of orange in a stadium you know its dutch.
There can be no confusion.
Nobody else is that orange.
No other country's eyes can bear it.
Beats trying to use red or white or blue as a colour.
Half of europe has at least two of those.
Pizza and beer in the office today to celebrate moving to new office.
OTOH I had three slices so I basically wont need dinner tonight.
But your stomache will still be empty 'round dinner time so thats not an upside at all.
<- first imgur comment So does she still need oven mitts or does she just grab that shit straight out?
I can distract it with videogames or water.
Now they are passing out chocolates.
Now those are really good questions.
MoonWolf safety first.
Minister so mitts then ?
What good are robot arms even if you still need oven mits.
Well she only has one.
Plus the fingertips are probably made of rubber for gripping and rubber is kinda melty.
And mitts come in pairs.
Quite often tied together.
Also yeah what Ana said.
Is he two pokemon ?
You're thinking of Seaking.
This man comes from a long line of people who are vision-quests.
MoonWolf did you watch any of the OW stuff.
Kirisu because Jim said so.
Yeah I cba'd as well.
Rando streamers I have no interest in.
All the info on fansites.
And not even the beta build.
Go back to WoW.
Just to get this new mount.
ChaosSmurf ok but why did Jim say so.
I told him I thought a jobbie was a wank for the longest time.
I don't know shite slang.
It is now twice as expensive to get a WoW sub with gold in the UK as in the US.
And not knowing the name for a thing = not being able to do it.
That is the correct response yes.
ChaosSmurf proof Â£ is twice as good as $.
Anathema except it's only about 1.5-1.6 atm iirc.
Kirisu plus VAT p.
And also ChaosSmurf was probably accounting for that?
Oh wait no he just said g.
We pay a little more for our sub over here.
But not twice as much.
How do we pay compared to â‚¬ is the real question.
Being on the same servers.
It's the same market.
Though they pay 20 euros.
If they buy it straight up.
Love me some round numbers tax.
Blizzard really don't like europe.
It's so difficult to get things here.
Like their experimental fps bytes.
Sending those intercontinentally will be the pinnacle of modern technology.
Tbh that is pretty maddening.
Every time they have a beta that starts exclusive to the US.
They deny European streamers from existing.
OW beta will make 5-10 full time streamers on its own same as HS did.
They don't seem to realise or don't care.
Unlike HS even EUers that manage to get in won't be able to put on as good a show with 100+ ping.
Care is the one.
ChaosSmurf you should listen to this week's Daft Souls btw.
Cool Ghosts have been playing a game that is basically Neptune's Pride but underwater.
And on iOS and Android.
Well guess what game we should NEVER PLAY.
I need to touch that game like I need another hole in my head.
But I am all-in on vicariously listening to others' enjoyment of it.
You will enjoy other peoples stretched friendships.
It includes the phrase I am lying to everyone on the game except you.
Whats this game even called ?
The I being Matt Lees and the you being Joe... Scribbles?
The units are submarines.
I would trust anyone talking to me while playing a game like definitly.
Why would they lie.
Another reason for you to avoid it.
Premade rpg characters are fine for one-shots right?
Kirisu yeah Subterfuge is all over my twitter feed.
Especially sketchy rebels ?
No that's how you spell Joe's second name.
Yeah I knew I was wrong.
But I only ever hear it.
Anyway so long as we're in agreement to never ever play it.
MoonWolf shorts definitely count as pants.
Ellen is expert at clothes.
>operating machinery without hearing protection >.
I got it hammered into my back when I worked last summer to always use it.
Kirisu not in this context.
Amazing Amazon US is actually willing to ship one of the Marvel Legendary expansions to me.
And its cheaper than Amazon UK too.
Even with the shipping distance ?
US Price is $1596 136.56SEK including AmazonGlobal Expedited Shipping 13040SEK it totals at 26696SEK. UK price is a totla of 307SEK.
Dollar to SEK rate is according to amazon 1 for 8 and then GPB is 1 to 13.
Of course then I might just run into some import tax if I'm really unlucky.
Sorry our currency is too strong for your card games =P.
It's always been like 12 or 13 to 1 soooo.
Does your currency even lift?
Not against the pound. We got weaker against the dollar a year ago as before it was 6 to 1.
Euro is 9 to 1 and has always been that afaik.
That set of statements contains at least one contradiction.
Heck using Amazon US is cheaper than Amazon Germany. v.
In that you can't have maintained similar rates with both EUR and GBP because the rate has not kept steady.
1 EUR = 9.7345584468 SEK 1 GBP = 13.2323441605 SEK 1 USD = 8.5562705757 SEK exchange rates according to Amazon.
Ah found some swedish retailers for that expansion. THat's good. Even if there isn't much of a price difference I discover v.
Vi Ã¤r Overkill och vi hatar vÃ¥rare spelare p.
Wrong channel but whatever.
I really should just buy TTS at some point so I can play Legendary and Conquest ther.
Man losing in doa and virtual fighter more than usual today.
My uni textbook is available for download as a pdf.
This'd be great except... it's literally *a* pdf. One. For the book that covers the entire year.
Previous years have split their material into at least 4 volumes.
Anyway lacking the actual exercises I went to the student forum and there's a bunch of folks posting haiku.
So I guess I'll try writing some of those.
Writing dumb poems / haiku make no sense at all / fuck the seasonal words.
But national peotry day has already passed.
During a QA at the end of the panel one fan asked if the tools would be flexible enough to create a co-op mod. And it turns out that yes they would. Modders would need to supply their own matchmaking server but otherwise the possibility is there. rad.
MoonWolf one too many syllables on your last line.
I appreciate that may have been on prose.
Look i'm not great at counting them in english okay.
Who still cares about SC2 singleplayer.
Going to play some HotS with Gimble if anyone cares to join in.
We're all playing HotS in here.
In case you're expecting literally any other conversation.
Are you talking exclusively hots.
Well enjoy your thingymajig.
We at least it isn't Hearthstone vOv.
I dunno hearthstone would be an improvent over some MOBAA P.
At least it's some variation.
!note mairbear let me know when you are going to beat a fool in HS.
MoonWolf I can give it a shot now.
Wait.. cancel that >.<.
Apparently DPS queues are a matter of seconds at this time xP.
Am in mumb anyway tho.
Hm. wonder if I have to switch motherboards again.
The USB ports in this one have been acting up lately.
Aw man now I want a donut.
Noelor what about a tuna sandwich.
I guess I'm just generally hungry.
Will have to try that method at some point thanks.
Some of those are not even donuts.
Problem with that way is that its a shortcut that while it might be useful occasionally doesn't really help with other perspectives.
Hey Olesh I have a question... do you know what currency that silly site Halman used to buy Blood bowl 2 uses?
I was just about to mention that v.
I must have hit refresh on my podcast app minutes before that went up.
Don't even know what that is.
It's one of those all-in-one Mumble/IRC things.
But it seems pretty good.
From the way you reported it I guess another twitter client.
We should keep using stuff invented in the 80s like IRC.
And seperate programs for thigns.
How do they make money.
ChaosSmurf remember that time that integrating everything mde it better.
Fairly sure they don't.
After years of IRC.
And then using campfire/glip/slack/discord.
We are living in the dark ages.
There is 14 employees.
The incredibly robust unbreakable dark ages.
$12m in VC money.
But it doesn't have integrations MoonWolf.
>actually claim skype and TS lower your FPS in games.
Skype is really bad dude.
I am amazed anyone uses Skype on a regular basis.
Fucking Teamspeak is better than Skype.
I have to use it for Skype now and I'm like PLEASE.
Skypes only issue is no push-to-talk.
And it being a horribly bloated pile of shit.
Skype has a push to talk actually.
It just slightly convoluted to set it up as its classified as mute mic instead.
It can't be set to a mouse button gg skype.
Pretty sure I can set it to my sidemouse buttons.
It registered after like the 5th click not confident S.
Anyway I don't trust discrod.
Shrug don't use the skype call except for rpg sessions and I havent really played with my other group in a while as they're CtLing.
Its a real shame everything is dreadful.
Time to watch more onepunch man.
Saving that for dinner tomorrow.
Well thats my level 60 class quest done with.
Time to start re-learning this class.
Bahh seems my final fantasy realm is going to be offline until tomorrow |.
And I cant draw since my USB ports are fucked up. And I didn't sleep enough this is going to be one of those days P.
Can't draw because no usb ports what a modern problem p.
Problem with drawing in my sketch book is that I lost my eraser.
Now thats a non modern problem.
The cutest dark lord.
Hmm One-Punch Man. Not bad.
That looks useful thanks.
Tonight if the first session of WHFRP with my new character who isn't a one-armed elf woo.
What are you playing now ?
Agent of the Shroud a splinter cult of Morr the god of death in the Empire that hunt down undead.
Is that an actual job ?
What do you mean?
Is that what you are rping while playing an undead hunter or osmething or is agent of the shroud the actual thing.
Its an actual thing.
They have a castle in Tilea and everything.
I'm basically a religious undead-hating fanatic.
Well eveyrone else in the empire is undead hating and a religious fanatic.
You just have a slightly different sect of religion.
And because I'm from Ostland probably also an alcoholic Ostland borders Kislev got royally fucked when Archaon invaded.
Vary few people hate the undead so much that they go out of their way to hunt them down!
Also AotS gets a hilariously good talent.
Flat +20% bonus to perception tests kinda redic.
Also because they were too busy robbing the tomb they are in the skeleton patrol we saw leave has come back.
So you know how in an MMO if you engage some mobs and then run away they reset?
They basically did that to some magical lion statues to kill them one at a time.
They didn't heal to full when they leashed ?
They killed one without resetting it.
Luckily the corridors are narrow so their numerical advantage is worthless.
GlennCuttlefish you could make an alt on my realm xD.
Incidentally what was your realm cos I may well do that for lols when my own server goes boom tomorrow B.
Why would it go boom.
I mean any more than mine does mine just has extra maintenance now.
I think it was on cerberos?
Mine has long downtime tomorrow.
I'm so glad you guys don't play on the same realms it has helped kill my desire to play ffxiv again.
They don't even play the same region.
MoonWolf amaz is doing a gimmick.
He lost a match and now is eating a hot chili pepper.
This is a dumb gimmick.
Lets see what decks he's even using.
MairBear so is amaz just bad a hot stuff or is he eating ridiculous pepers.
Because thats not the reaction i expect this early in.
He's bad at hot stuff.
He tried to drown it with water.
Except make your mouth slightly colder.
Also some fairly un-ripe looking banana.
Man way to pussy out amaz.
I mean it's no hot-pepper gaming reaction.
But then again it wasn't a death-causing thing.
Yeah but those guys are eating actual ridiculous chilis.
Also still the silliest gimmick.
Nobody seems to be suggesting that.
Stupid gimmicks are probably earning them thousands of pounds.
Back to not watching amaz.
Only eating one if he doesn't get 12 wins in an arena.
Such a cheap way out.
I predict chat is spamming scamaz etc.
It's an easy prediction to make.
Well 1 he can regularly 12 win.
And 2 even if he doesn't he'll have hours in between completed runs.
So its just a cheap way out.
Oh my god. I decided on a whim to read the instruction manual for a new sandwich grill and it made me laugh so hard I started crying.
CAUTION Be careful when biting into sandwhich containing fillings such as cheese tomato or jam as they retain heat and can burn if eaten too quickly.
Its a good warning.
Those things will turn your mouth into a vulcano.
This follows after a 12 step instruction of how to properly use it.
My first thought was pretty much Yeah they're proofing themselves from being sued.
Man its gonna be weird booking a ticket for EP7 this early.
There we go. Tickets for SW Ep7 booked.
What if its shit though ?
He'll have found out first hand!
Noelor how goes moving house plans ?
An unprepared as I am for anything else in life.
You'll be fine then.
~MoonWolf what if its shit though ? - to be fair I dont care because I'm not the one paying for the tickets P.
Hm. I Kind of want to try making a deep dish pizza one of these days.
Problem is I was never any good with dough.
Maybe I'll try it on wednesday.
>not the one paying for the tickets< ah there we go.
I'll probably enjoy it anyway so.
Haven't really been disappointed going to the movies because I'm really picky with it.
When *is* SW7 out anyway?
Should be a new trailer today at some point.
I've been avoiding them since the first one.
Ended up seeing more of that at a friend's the other night was a bit annoyed.
Checked my youtube for new videos 2 hours ago.
Now 28 new videos.
WELCOME TO TREE OF SAVIOUR THE ONLY GAME WITH VUVUZELAS.
Fuck I forgot to sign up for this beta.
Do you have that webm of the anime with the wizard casting all the buffs?
It was still in my recent notifications.
I'm now being asked what it's from.
Going to assume Database.
End of evangelion while it had flaws had some damn impressive DVD menu's. also probably spoilers.
<- what even is this.
If I recall it was about some guy getting rescued by a mermaid and then gets married into the mermaid yakuza that his rescuer is part of.
Bah. after a week my head is still half full of snot. I wish this thing would decide if it wanted to worsen or just go away.
Ah well at least there's new yuru to watch.
Are the yuru's still yuri-ing ?
If anything its intensified with the ova's.
My only complaint is that the new OP is mediocre.
Well not every OP can be the One-Punch Man OP.
I would say this is borderline lewd at times now.
All yuri is wholesome family yuri.
Yuri families are the most wholesome.
Rocket slime is pretty dope.
You know what I hate about watching streamed movies?
My internet always fucks up on critical moments.
Ehh this new jurassic park is not as bad as people were saying.
I mean its dumb as hell but.
I found it entertaining.
They do have a decent explanation for that in the movie p.
Might as well be they breathe through their skin.
It's more Wu admitting that the things in the park aren't even real dinosaurs with how much they've fucked with their DNA so who cares.
One of these days I will hunt down discworld audiobooks that are not shit.
Like this copy of men at arms I have downloaded is missing a large chunk of the book.
Initially thought that was a production value complaint.
Like a stephen fry did the HP audiobooks who's this gravitas-less voice actor.
The narrator's are usually..Decent enough but the audio quality is horrible there are some baffling abbreviation choices like cutting out a lot of the jokes and the missing pieces.
Consequence of the torrent or the original?
I would assume its a bad rip for the missing parts. Jokes were clearly intentionally cut out.
GlennCuttlefish I was wrong I thought Chaos data center was immune to today's downtime. c.
Started listening to this week's Daft Souls.
Week two of Subterfuge we all hate each other now This game is horrible never play it or it will kill your friendship.
Week two of Subterfuge we all hate each other now This game is horrible never play it or it will kill your friendship <- this.
Exalted 3 might come within the next 7 days.
I'm not sure i'm ready for this.
Ex3 allegedly this actual week.
Week two of Subterfuge we all hate each other now This game is horrible never play it or it will kill your friendship <- this.
Unrelated my dad's annoying me.
Sent a super patronising email from Japan.
And I mean if anyone has a right to patronise me it's my actual dad but it really has my heckles up.
You're moving out again in a few days he's just trying to get some good dadding in before that.
Everything alright Minister ?
Yeah just a bit gripy totes a word shut up.
What? Nah get out m8.
Anathema prmomg is a word that I'm reading with the pronunciation I need more caffeine.
Minister confirmed didn't have coffee until 10.
See that's your problem right there.
I commuted through town this morning got a latte at 8.
Good start to the day.
Time in queue 32 minutes. Estimated time Not given.
In a way that seems more honest.
Squenix are gonna burn down peoples houses in ffxiv on christmas day.
They're implementing an inactivity system for people who have houses but aren't using them.
And the first time that'll activate is christmas day.
Time to start saving 80million.
Anathema what day are you showing up in Newcastle btw?
Just found out I'm working 30th 31st but shouldn't be in the office long.
Also it'll be my own house I'm leaving you in!
And there are decent shops nearby.
I will be bringing my laptop.
Minister sure could! I'll be up in Newcastle for Christmas.
Its true mair.
GlennCuttlefish They're playing with us.
Playing like a damn fiddle with us.
There is just no dps at all in the queue.
Nobody queuing as dps.
Screw you too synthesis >C.
At least its not ff11 synthesis.
86% hq failed so I just said fuck it got unlucky quality ended up with a 12% chance for HQ.
And that second one workd.
12% chances were in my favour?
Well in total you had a 98% chance.
Thats totally how math works.
Confirmed you're mathematical prowess is 3.17/AMAZ.
What have I done.
Also any takers for mumble cos why not.
I can i suppose.
GlennCuttlefish Awwwh c.
Cooked_Auto you mean you can't see how cold those earrings are?
Almost makes you want to learn how to play a banjo.
Sweeet found an ebay auction for Old World Armoury for Â£20.
Never seen it that low before.
We should play an RP in Newcastle.
MairBear Asian food dot gif.
Despite our wildly divergent preferences.
I will work out what once I've confirmed who's there.
Currently you and maybe-ar.
My inclination would be Fellowship if it's out by then.
Being something I've backed on K$.
And not yet played.
200 words? why even bother pretending to have a system at that scale.
Because someone liked the challenge of desgining a functional system within a limit perhaps?
Town's noodle bar's sichuan sauce is quite a bit hotter than that of the chinese takeaway in the suburbs we order from.
Enjoying your aching tastebuds ?
Less so my nose's reaction.
You're not supposed to snort it.
Are you sure ?
So as part of my grand inquisition to fix the hole in the sky in dragon age.
I murdered someone at a ball.
Now i'm judging... the corpse.
Omg she's so fat judging or 10 for blood 7 for ragdoll judging or what?
I'm thinking Tyrael ult judging.
Oh as part of being the inquisition you can take prisoners during your investigations and then judge them.
Like exile to the countryside or off with his head judging.
Do they ever expect you?
Yes i'm somewhat famous at this point in the game.
It's a Bioware game.
Because you're the biggest deal.
I operate a amry that spans two massive nations has recruited most of the organized mages in those nations and allied with the legendary grey wardens.
Also i keep putting flags everywhere that means sutff is under my protection.
Did you and Mair end up meeting the same NPC in different games earlier?
Or did I misunderstand that exchange of screenshots?
Mairbear wished to show me how big an elephant was.
Then i showed mairbear how freaking big the bear was i was fighting.
All I saw was Hildegard.
Or w/e his name is.
My screenshot was two screen spanning.
You probably just noticed the right screen.
It still had that image open.
Apparently some psychologist did tests and people like things the longer they're exposed to them.
And this includes why we hate our actual voice.
And for some of us photos of ourselves.
Because they're subtley different to what we've heard/seen our whole lives.
We must test this.
All we have to do is find a baby temprorarily disable their vocal chords for 20 years and then give them a microphone after the surgery.
That seems like it might not pass an ethical commission.
New rotation in HotS all characters except one I'm already 5+.
I like them all even.
Just play what you enjoy then.
Also it's almost all Warcraft hope you like Kerrigan and Valla if you get their franchises' dailies.
MoonWolf yeah once I get Stitches to 5 it'll characters I've bought.
Because I got last week's storm package >.>.
4 warriors and azmodan.
This'll be a game and a half.
Depends how good the az's stack game plays out.
Kirby 64 The Crystal Shards is a highly technical video game It is *she swings Kirby's firesword twice kills miniboss without even looking at it*.
Those were highly technical swings.
Huh Linking Park is the closing concert for Blizzcon this year.
I'm sure ChaosSmurf will enjoy that.
By sound of it maybe.
Someone was talking to me tonight about long-range ecksmas gift thoughts.
Am I a bad person for having at the back of my mind dude just get sw7 stuff.
That requires a lot of confidence that someone will like a movie that isn't out yet.
I had a silly gift idea for Noelor of all people but I'd have to check some things first to see its doable.
I'd have to get you something.
And we can't buy guns in the UK.
Also wts is this identity.
Sqrt3/3e = g = i/2.
If you want to know it was going to be a knitted Ms Marvel plushie of sorts. Mom talked about knitting a Captain America thing for one of her workmates at some point.
Also sqrt3g = e = sqrt3/2i though that's just a rearrangement.
And yes in fact 2g = i = 2/3sqrt3e is also on here.
Aw that'd be cute.
E 2.818 g 9.81 i sqrt-1?
But pix would be fine =P.
Yeah Dob but those don't equate that way.
Like last I checked gravity wasn't .5 in the imaginary axis.
One of the guys in my RPG group on skype wanted to do Secret Santa. v Which I'm hesitant to for multiple reasons one of them being I really don't want to get the dumbest fucking joke present ever which I'.
*I'm sure someone would do.
So where've you found this ballsed up maths?
I'm going to see if I can find the original.
Because I just tried copying the imgurl and uh.
The transparency is fucked.
All the triangle and circle formulae are fine even if some are in weird places.
I'm not sure what's going on at the bottom either actually.
They're the sides of the half-triangle relative to each other.
Oh jeez this is actually frustrating me.
But there's no statement that e=h.
Which would be the case.
And yeah that's what I was possibly thinking.
And the area at the bottom is the area of a half triangle?
No idea what p is still though.
Half the perimeter of a triangle? what?
Could it be C as well?
Might that work if you wrap it round.
I mean that's not an identity I know of but maybe?
Circumference of a circle is half the perimeter of a triangle tangential on all sides to the circle?
Also am I right in thinking that the triangle is necessarily regular?
Equilateral probably makes it regular.
Right I mean the triangle that signifies the invisibility cloak is to the best of my knowledge equilateral anyway.
But is it true that a polyhedron the edges of which are each tangential to the same circle is always regular?
I just dont get the choice in variable letters.
I think it is but dunno if that's just one of those brain tricks.
Non-native English speaking artist.
Different conventions I guess.
I just noticed they skipped an f variable moving to a g and an i.
Yeah like I said the e/g/i set I have no even slight idea.
I have discovered that AT = pr which isn't stated there.
But is a use for that p.
Conventionally s in English but w/e.
Anyway now that I understand every formula on that shirt.
I can order one.
We have spent more time debating its mathematical meaning than the hours you will spend in total wearing it.
...I'm pretty sure I'll spend more than half an hour wearing a t-shirt.
You are so tumblr sometimes.
Anyway I should be in bed.
Turn on sound for this 3.
2112 apparently some psychologist did tests and people like things the longer they're exposed to them <--- another reason why advertising and the incredibly narrow range of music played on the radio are bad.
MoonWolf how much longer after getting the castle does it take for DAI to start being fun?
If you don't dig it before that i don't think its going to change much for you.
Fuck what a waste of Â£50.
If only games had some sort of short trial thing you could play to decide if you liked it.
Coulda spent that on more out of print RPG books.
Clocks go back soon.
Finally booked my train back from Newcastle.
About as far in advance as you can and still more expensive than a flight from Glasgow -> London.
Wait no SU this week?!
Can't even come out regularly.
Then again as a gravity falls fan I am not even feeling this.
I think I have something inside my eyelid.
That has to be annoying as hell.
Look its me very badly playing the tetris theme bad quality sound.
Isn't it supposed to accelerate ?
Just speed up your video.
MoonWolf I said badly !
My fingers are too cold and my anxiety too high to do it any faster without fucking up p.
At least its no A Bison.
Other option is clearly M Bison.
MoonWolf opponent in stream just now.
Plays a warsong commander plays a patron. Pauses for 5 seconds. Concedes.
MairBear blizzard is giving players on the new japan HS realm the same amount of packs as you opened on NA.
That could be a lot of packs.
If you played mostly on NA yeah.
Is that why everyone's suddenly got a japanese client?
MoonWolf tavern brawled the dumbest paladin.
I had web-wrap as my power he plays a minion and double blessing of might + divine shields... and leaves it on its own.
THen later I get web wrap again and he super boosts up his kvaldir raider gets a 2/2 slime thing plays a secret and when I kill it it was avenge.
2 mana later he gets his 15/14 back.
I don't think he was paying much attention to the mechanic of this brawl.
Is that why everyone's suddenly got a japanese client? <- i think thats just streamers wanting to get pack opening hype and or hoping to p0wn some n00bz.
Oh hey the Spider-Man expansion for Legendary finally arrived. Man its going to be fun figuring out how to sleeve these cards tomorrow.
Oh my god this Watch Dogs LP update. Oh. My. God.
I have yet to see it.
How bad can it be.
Its one specific part in this case.
MairBear you've watched arrested development?
Can't not hear Gob as BoJack.
Vice versa for me but I hear what you're saying xD.
Likewise for the Lucille and Malory Archer.
And then the grandma just wtf.
The grandma is the best part and where my reaction comes from because its so random and amazing.
Yo u ar ecorrect.
And now i need to remember my drivethru account.
Or just make a new one i gues.
Their servers are dying.
Been on processing order for a couple of minutes now.
I'm downloading a pdf.
Ok now I am too.
Its taking forever to download this 51 mb file.
Anathema i guess we get to find out if nishkriya blows up under heavy forum activity today.
Why did the game actually release?
Exalted 3 is officially out.
I refuse to believe it.
Well i have not read it yet.
So it might be out.
But its looking good.
Only 2 more minutes on this download.
Somebody post a totally legit link when you can.
Ember good day to be busy moving stuff i guess.
MoonWolf gonna be interesting to see if there was a a traffic spike.
I am still eating and sleeping at paroh!
I thought you were busy at new place assembeling furnuture.
I should probably make nishkriya refresh faster now.
MoonWolf nah just cleaning and stuff.
Then parents got back from Japan.
2001 I should probably make nishkriya refresh faster now <- just that.
...if I had any idea how to login to the server.
Anyway my stuff is still mainly at my parents' including my bed.
And I'm eating here because chairs.
This book is beautiful.
But yeah tomorrow I'm going to be probably assembling and whatnot.
GlennCuttlefish its out.
IT HAS NO BOOKMARKS.
How does it not have bookmarks.
On the subject of Kickstarters this is finishing soon.
Hopefully it won't take three years.
MoonWolf Rich's email did warn of this fact.
MoonWolf Bookmarks is another year away. Sorry.
Noelor you know how we talked about how it would probably have a bad index glossery.
Good news its not bad.
If you read Rich's emails.
This PDF will not include the Index or hyperlinks or bookmarks as we want to put them in once we've input any errata and not try to fix them afterwards from Monday.
You can bookmark headers.
This shouldn't be an issue.
The index doesn't believe archery is something that has charms.
The bit on SAP on page 266 makes me smile.
I found Noelor in the credits but not myself yet.
MairBear Moon Moon worst lunar ever is in the credits.
Fuck I used my real name.
Bob's Burgers is fuckin' good.
Well I finally encountered something in zestiria that seriously makes me consider dropping the difficulty down from hard.
And it wasn't even a boss a mini boss optional monster or anything.
Just a bullshit normal enemy that has almost killed me twice now.
I just realised soak is a single value now.
X-Men shirt from Qwertee ordered. Couldn't resist.
Aw yeah this guy's back.
Ember yay that guy.
There's also someone on RPGnet doing a way worse job.
I could bench press the Queen important statistics.
With or without royal crown mantel scepter ?
I did not realize people were building a stellerator of that size.
So the future of fusion is a steampunk doughnut.
GlennCuddlefish it always was but yes.
The whole laser induced fusion never really had much future.
The question is if its a proper donut.
Or a spherical donut.
YouTube in Chrome has had an upgrade in the last couple days.
That I've only just completely twigged to.
But if you open a YouTube video in a background tab it won't start playing until you look at that tab.
Oh i don't use chrome so i have no idea what you are talking about.
This is either good or bad depending on how you use background tabs.
I have an addon for that.
Only play 1 video at a time need to manually start them.
It'll start automatically when you do click on the relevant tab.
It also does not limit to 1 video at a time.
Without youtubecentre youtube is a massive pain in the ass to use for me.
That is 10^9 Rupees I think?
It's a lot of money.
A crore /ËˆkrÉ”É™r/ abbreviated cr is a unit in the Indian numbering system equal to ten million.
Ember sorry we went for groceries right after dinner.
MoonWolf we only played another couple games anyway.
Gimbleb had stuff to do I had dinner too.
I just had a moment of oh no I've not seen this week's yet!
How hard can it be to make 10 minutes of animation each week.
Thats divinity OS alright.
Basically that game in a nutshell.
Oh tDO's working on Scion 2.0.
MairBear you doing Japanese on Thursdays still/again?
I think a list of castes that can choose this ability next to each ability entry in the traits chapter might have been nice.
I am very tempted to go into this pdf and bookmark it up and then changing all the charmnames / page references into hyper links.
I wo't because i'd have to repeat the effort the next time.
And because someone's already done the first part of it.
Happen to have a link to one of those ?
Nope because there's no link on SA because files.
But it has been confirmed to exist.
I shall inquite in #allunderheaven.
Pretty sure someone on the official forums has too.
I have acquired one the download is being really slow.
It shall be on dropbox when i finished.
Bookmarked pdf should start pirating itself into your dropboxes any moment now.
GlennCuddlefish good lord merlwyb's new voice 'C.
We need more falcons in the world.
Anathema why do you hate ducks.
I just finished the Saving the Flame quest. My reaction.
There is some pretty bad art on p225.
Of Volfer and Faka Kun drinking with some midriffy wench while Peleps Deled throws a drink at himself in the background.
And some bad perspectivce on those screens.
Make it look askew.
Noelor it looks like they really cut down the evocation trees.
Artifacts are no longer whole combat charm trees on their own.
Yeah there was something on Nishkriya about it.
Is it just me or is p248 completely empty?
Noelor one thing though with the chapter fiction below that.
I think if Nellens was still alive.
He could legitimtly do that.
Yes or Tepet iirc.
English spelling is dumb fact the e in Psyche is pronounced.
I prefer my version.
Perilous is not a keyword I expected to mean can't be used while in crash.
Yeah that implies using this is risky.
I'd expect that you *can* use it while crashed.
Can't believe Husband-Seducing Demon Dance got renamed.
But that there's a chance it fucks you over even more.
Going to try and build tuscatsi 2.0 tomorrow.
Adamant Arrow Technique makes an arrow the solar shot impossible to destroy or remove from its target.
This is free benefit to Phantom Arrow Technique at E3+ which is just as well because it's completely pointless.
Its great if you want to pin badguys to walls.
Noelor or track someone yeah we're looking for a guy with an arrow stuck in his shoulder.
I'm not seeing an Archery charm for wielding a vast array of melee weapons though.
So they obviously just don't know how archers work.
Or summoning a ton of them from an alternate dimension.
Watching dragonball z resurrection f.
Comic relief badguys wish for A Million Zennies.
Dragon drops a small pile of paper bills in front of them.
Oh gods Awakening Eye.
Fuck you and the dice you rolled in on.
It might not be as bad in practice as it looks.
Oh Lunar mates are still a thing.
I think they are optional now though.
So not all solars have mates and not all lunars are mated.
As yet another minor formatting thing I feel that especially without bookmarks the ability headers for the charm section could be bigger.
Drawing one's Lunar mate gobbling cake I see you there Vance.
And today's Qwertee shirts can only be described as insufferable.
Wonder if I still have that CRT TV somewhere.
Friend was throwing old stuff away and now I own a pair of these.
Will buy that at a sale I guess.
Not sure I like the art style.
It looks a bit too much like the old graphics put through an emulator filter.
Might be better in motion.
What happens when my obligation triggers ? Aka you're fucked bro Yeesh.
MairBear what final magical crystal fantasy world realm are you on ?
Faerie on the Aether data center.
Oh no th emoon was bahamut all along.
Damn a trial account is now allowed to make a dragon waifu.
Guess i'll wait with this untill i finish DAI and then buy it.
I do have to head away today some thing someplace. But if you do make a character i'll be back this evening.
Not happening today if i can't be a dragon lady.
This is critical Cooked_Auto.
What good is being a dragoon if you're not also a dragon.
Does someone wanna come earn me a pack with a win.
ChaosSmurf still need that win ?
No sir I dont enjoy the character creation in shadowrun.
GlennCuddlefish One word Chummer.
Or in other words THere is a program for that.
Used that for my SR character.
Will check it out thanks.
4th or 5th ed?
Already downloaded but thanks.
Lets arrange that then.
Mahou Shoujo Psycho Pass - I can get behind this.
Ok I wanna run exalted now it's basically out.
Mair can't do Thursdays Glenn can't do Fridays I can't do any other night of the week so that's annoying.
MoonWolf any preference before I do notes to Ana and with supreme optimism Smurf?
Technically I could do fridays if we started later?
Its saturday morbi wheres my poppy.
Noelor i can do not wednesdays.
I always have to check Mair's capitalisation for some reason.
CA I'm right in thinking you're not interested in Ex3 right?
Myeah sorry. Lost all interest in that.
I can't really committ to anything bth.
It's the backer copy of the pdf.
So there's still some dumb formatting errors and typos but.
And yeah I thought that might be the case.
I don't even like the front cover.
This is basically the beta versin of the book.
That bit of art before the introduction chapter is.
With all the sigs as animes?
The woman on the boat.
Also to surprise you not one but she isn't suppose to be white.
The anime sigs are aight.
She's probably meant to have a human face too.
OP apparently had a lot of trouble getting artists to not colour people's skin white.
Also with the sig who's trans.
Did they retcon infernals.
Infernals aren't mentioned by name.
Oh okay they're these other ones.
They're on the two-page art spread other Exalted exist but we're not telling you about them yet.
Jesus christ did they make a set of Exalted that are for people who think playing Exalted doesn't make them special snowflake enough.
Imo the Infernal there is the cool guy on the right foreground.
I would have gone with the chick with the green hand as an infernal.
Oh wait that is the one you mean.
Is it not a chick.
Looks like a bishie to me.
I like some of this art.
But some of it is unbelievably bad.
But he's standing next to the swolest motherfuckers.
There is literal poser art.
As in 3d poser the program.
Not what a poser.
This one with the apes for eg.
I dunno it's just weird that some of it is worse than 2nd ed.
No its the one with the lunar udner the table full of modern pies.
What are the terrifying mech things on p71.
Did they retcon the dragon-blooded killing all the solars.
Or did they change the system so it was at all believable.
Thats always going to be a thing.
Like I personally never had an issue with it but I know some did.
They've backed away from the system being in any way a resemblance of reality.
They've frontloaded so much fucking shit again.
This story bit is longer than Ex2 which was 50 pages too long.
Its all stories because no comics.
This is a fucking novel.
One of the stories is about the new Dawn sig going into a tavern to start a fight.
Aight I like the bit on page 115.
Would use as wallpaper.
He does this by wearing only a loincloth on which is written Approved by the Scarlet Empress.
Can we talk about this on mumble that would be easier with playing this game i'm playing.
120 pages until Character Creation *places head into hands*.
ChaosSmurf its a setting book as much as a splat.
Yeah Gimble wanted to hear about the new systems too.
It should be at the back imo.
That's how DD does it.
Short setup then BOOM make some characters.
The SR5th ed introduction chapter is pretty great.
I'm actually going to go sort food out.
But then yes mumble.
To the point it was lifted wholesale for a fluff booklet for the Shadowrun Crossfire boardgame.
Crunchy pick up Rwby S3. Surprising no-one.
Well thats a new one.
One of my USB cables just melted.
Of all the people I know I can absolutely believe that of you GlennCuddlefish.
....Whats that supposed to mean >m>.
Whenever you have computer issues you have it in styles.
You have at least one or two ranks in the Gremlins drawback.
Nonsense my machines work marvelously considering how much I abuse them.
Or at least the drawback itself. Not sure you can take it multiple times.
Nice both cable and controller still work.
Yeah but when they fail they fail spectacularly.
I wouldn't say gremlin.
If anything the opposite.
It's a Shadowrun reference >_>.
Oh you can take it multiple times.
When describing the effects of a Gremlin-induced glitch gamemasters should play up the notion of a particularlyweird mechanical or electronics malfunction.
Well this is certainly a boss fight.
Boss starts petrifying everything at the end of the fight. until that point its piss easy.
I have not seen a single item sold that removes petrify.
Im sure you will survive.
Albeit as a statue.
Well I did kill it.
How's everyone doing? Also what is ftrbzzs it sounds like a sneeze.
That's like how I described is.
Anyway she? is a colleague of ana's I think.
Womens in my irc?!
I might just be wrong.
Edilith don't go getting all jealous.
I think she literally flew back to Finland today.
Noelor also maybe will need to consider and read over that google doc I got an email mention about that I assume is a pitch.
>making me login to google.
You don't have to log in!
Unless you want to edit.
I assumed I wouldn't be but I was already logged in.
Noelor bearing in mind that I haven't yet had a chance to read the book GW2 expansion dropped last night waiting for a lady toget back from Tesco so I can watch anime atm is a mortal sorceror out of the question? I mean knowing me I'll change my mind once I read the book but good to eliminate things early if I can!
Mortal sorcery is possible I think?
Haven't read how yet but.
You'll be exalting a session or two in and it's possible to get sorcery at chargen painlessly.
Terrestrial sorcery being E1 now.
Celestial sorcery is not possible at chargen however.
Terrestrial sorcery is probably hella badass anyway.
It should well be at least >.
Countermagic is no longer an individual spell.
Learning sorcery comes with a free spell and that spell becomes somehow part of your sorcerer?
I haven't read the sorcery chapter at all basically.
So today I got more surprise loot from my friend. A book on manga anatomy fancy red box with some miniatures in it and....
But if its possible for mortals to be sorcerors you are not opposed on principal?
GlennCuddlefish the famous horse mask ?
Your halloween is set.
Now if you just had some better mobility in you to dance around.
Noelor is Agon the Prince That Was Promised?
Game of thrones reference.
Agon is a god I made up for this story.
Ptwp is a sham anyway.
<- You sayin' my potato isn't a real dragoon.
Noelor possibly! You have my interest!
You are inaudible I don't know if you can hear us.
Also I sent you a gDoc.
ChaosSmurf if you aren't there.
I will grumble loudly.
Anathema Mortal sorcerers initiate into the Terrestrial Circle by mastering a shaping ritual which they may purchase as a five-dot Merit that requires Occult 3. The first spell they learn becomes their control spell.
Vs learning one Occult charm that grants one spell free which is your control spell don't ask me what that is yet.
That game already happened.
Eugh. In another irc foreigners questioning brits going loco-a-gogo over the bbc and sky digging their poppies out in october.
Yeah it's a bit much.
Glenny pix of the horse mask!
Edilith you will get some when I actually bring it home.
Home? Where are you now?
I never filled out a permission slip.
I just didnt bring the loot home yet since I only went to fetch my phone originally.
I.. see.. this is acceptable.
ChaosSmurf this book has Demon Ink Tattoos.
Noelor are they obnoxiously broken.
Then they ain't DITs.
Noelor GlennCuddlefish MoonWolf.
Also Glenn when you get in feel free to throw a friend-req at Aellan Cadsen.
Why did I pick marauder.
You know what that means?
That's... nearly what I said.
Not nearly worth it.
Like you'd need at least 3 nanamos to make this place worth it.
Noelor MoonWolf.
Noelor i do uhhh intentionally???
Some charms have exceptions for this.
Then again the only girl exalt i managed to get in a game was astarte.
At the very least some melee charms explciitly can be used with brawl and ma etc.
Generally you can't mix and match so you could use an archery charm one round and then righteous devil later.
Also oh man there's a disease that turns poeple into skeletons.
The spoiler in this post is a thing of beauty.
And not super-duper spoilers imo.
Noelor how upset would people be at someone running around with wood claws for extended amounts of time while not punching things ?
I don't know about upset.
But it'd be really freakin' weird.
And if there are Immaculates about pretty anathemish.
MoonWolf decision points feel a bit weird.
Idk just a bit clunky maybe.
I get why they're there.
We'll see how it works out.
Depends on if any serious social influence hits the party.
Oh oh there are restrictions on repeat influence.
That they explain a few pages after the restrictions on repeated resistance of influence.
Also in addition to the red rule sexual orientation is inviolable.
No arguing someone into being gay.
Or not gay or whatever.
I like that the investigation rules say to explain your clues if players roll for them.
Because y'know Arianna might have the acument of Sherlock Holmes but her player does not.
I typed heaven's feel into google image.
Forgetting that this was the porniest of routes in FSN.
Did not think that one through at all.
But I did also get what I was looking for.
Which was a reference for which of Shirou's arms gets... bandaged?
Not fucking cut off and replaced with another arm.
Just put some bandages on it.
I dunno how else to describe wrapped from knuckle to shoulder in ribbon.
Which if I can find stuff for it is what I'll be doing for halloween.
I have no idea where this edit came from but I much prefer it to the original and hope it is used for the movie ova?
So many cute puppies she became catatonic.
The one day we are playing shadowrun and I cant find my D6 cube.
C_A got any spell pointers? So far I am taking heal some form of stun increase attribute but beyond that I am still unsure.
Stun is always good.
Otherwise I'm not too sure as my SR4 character is a cybered Face.
And I dont think the others in my SR group are awake yet.
And I am playing different edition as well it seems.
Levitate seems like it could have some uses in this.
That doesnt change things too much.
But stun is a good idea if anything. Stun in any shape or form is both your best friend and your worst enemy.
My group hates flashbangs with a passion.
But I asked so we'll see when someone comes around to answer.
I'm serious don't trust this eel woman. has to be the best tag I've seen in a while.
GlennCuddlefish Oh yeah I suddenly remember one SR spell you should have. Invisibility.
That infernal has some serious hips 'n' thighs going on damn.
Oh hey a Poppy.
Ftrbzzs what espresso things did you say I should getg?
Cooked_Auto is that some sort of krogan cosplay?
Nope one of these.
Am on mumble if people wanna chat.
MoonWolf not going a sorcery person because Tuscatsi was a rad character.
Omg 2 diablo games *again*.
If you are not in game could you wait for me to join you ?
I shall jump on that wagon too.
MoonWolf the art director for PoE/Armored Warfare has been doing it longer than I have been alive.
Game thinks that is fitting attire for a low level melee class.
If you're only low level.
Though I'm slowly graduating into this.
Why are you not a potato though?
Flat metal chest plate with no midriff or boob-cubs.
Noelor cos I broke the mold one time.
She doesn't look very dragon.
Well first shadowrun session.
One PC dead one major plot PC dead.
Quill-Weave is a canon NPC from Oblivion.
One PC dead one major plot PC dead <- t hats certainly a start.
Oh somebody already started porting Alchemicals into 3e.
Charms will use distances in meters when referenced not yards lol.
Long distances still miles for some reason *shrug*.
Half-breeds in this game can be half-and-half anything.
So we have a half-saurian halfling.
Who has just realised she'll look like a DD kobold.
I ended up with no negative abilities on this character but I'm not sure if that's better or worse than last time.
When I had a -2 but also a +4.
Seems like a good deal.
And yeah those boots seem legit.
For insight into what sort of podcast 6FU is read the description of the first part of this week's update.
Especially the last sentence.
Next Game Thursday December 26 555AM GMT+1 4 years from now The GM for the Star Wars Edge of the Old Republic game sure is optimistic about when to start the whole thing v.
Assassins don't tend to threaten projects... so much as they threaten the leader's continued ability to draw breath thanks Ex3.
But wait he's not a cuttlefish right now!
At night there is a less than 1% chance that Some NPCs ghost appears for a few seconds in any of the three city-states. She can be seen only by the players who finished Tam-Tara Deepcroft Hard.
You dare doubt me mortal?
What the shit FF.
Have a snoring hummingbird.
I like the translation.
Was having a bad evening went to Rwby S3 to try and unwind.
Opening portion ended up covering the same stuff going round my head and wrecking me anyway.
>Lallafel with a poofy afro.
Im amazed at Emma's sleeping posture.
Are you though Cooked_Auto?
It's Emma Frost come on.
Well its a very un-Emma pose.
Was playing guildwars at 5am again hooray for my brain.
Thats a bad time to be playing games.
I was literally lying awake from half three to quarter to five.
Mfw I find a bug showing that something was clearly not tested |.
MairBear GlennCuttlefish You should check the trailer for the FF14 patch just because of the hair.
You can finally live your dream of being a lalafel with an afra.
Noelor I know where my confusion about where the Trials of Agon is set came from now I got east and west confused >_>.
I have a character in mind now though.
I cannot get over how pretty this book is.
Is there some kind of law about water temples always being the worst?
Its the law of zelda.
Hooray my DH game isn't on tonight due to missing 3 players.
I get to sleeeep.
We'll see how that goes.
So I went to a zone where you cant use any of your abilities and walk at about 40% of your usual speed because of the evil aura of what the game so far is setting up to be the last boss.
It won't be the last boss.
Tales games don't work that way.
Now my options were to turn back or go farther in and see whats up. And then I found that guy. Who is the big bad. Just standing there.
Reminds me of Duke from Vesperia.
Only more obviously evil.
MoonWolf I forgot what having fun was like in Hearthstone.
Control Warrior is reminding me.
Not that much fun t hen.
I still enjoy secret mage but something about control warrior entertains me greatly.
For comparison I am level 40 in that screenshot.
Finished the main story for DAI plot dragon was very disapointing after all th eother dragons.
Came in at half hp and was barely a challenge.
Used like 3 potions.
Is that not just how it's done though? Plot battles these days are weaker than sidebosses.
Still feels underwhelming when it happens though.
These are kind of rad.
This sums how about I feel while trying to kill giganto monsters on the difficulty above hard.
MoonWolf Brian Don't call me Brian bmkibler Kibler Kibler Kibler is streaming HS.
I am starting to think this difficulty is a bit much for now.
I am pretty sure I am progressing as the plot wants me to. Atm I am at around level 40.
This story boss is level 80.
OF COURSE HE ALSO HAS A MYSTIC ARTE.
Any chance of seeing a full sized Scroll of Swallowed Darkness this time around maybe it could be called Red Rule Codex? this type of Exalted player is why we have a red rule.
Second level of Unreal 2 as described by the guy LPing it Killing fucking space spiders with your big ass flamethrower. Said with a good german accent.
C_A so as the situation is in our shadowrun after our first mission we killed some bigshot of a random go-ganger whose name and gang I forget nearly killed a major player from the ancients and we have the kidnapped child of some high up rengaku person in our custody.
Something tells me our future will involve a lot of running.
The GM had planned for the ancients bigshots to become a kind of ally to us but unfortunately that plan didn't survive contact with the players.
So was it Harlequin or? p.
I dont think it was a canon NPC.
Usually that GM prefers to create his own personalities.
But we did learn that sufficient amounts of explosives are useful.
Yeah we dont have any canon npcs in our campaign either. We had a minor reference to Harlequin and a bunch of others when we got zapped by a illusion spell while driving through manastorm.
Oh yes. Very useful.
Like the time in our campaign the rigger gibbed a room full of ninjas with a single riflegrenade.
Also the spell rules in this game are needlessly confusing. pretty sure we got it entirely wrong.
At least you're not playing a Decker. Have fun with those rules.
Though I think my GM said they simplified it for 5the?
Err I guess but not much.
As far as Im aware.
A grenade that explodes into rifles?
Noelor As in a grenade that is launched from a rifle p.
Something like that shooting one of these.
Although in this case it was mounted on a flying drone.
GlennCuddlefish I can pass any rules questions along if you so like.
This crafting system has given itself this themetune in my head.
Noelor MoonWolf Smol-FFcat.
MoonWolf player name Lovely Kitty.
Sleep until it's today in Cali.
!note Noelor looks like the EX3 thread had the same conversation as us last night.
MoonWolf which conversation was that?
Anathema you missed it but a lot of talk about crafting.
The OST for NeoTokyo is very good and free to download.
MoonWolf I can't find anything of value in that thread inbetween all the awful SA noise.
Ftrbzzs I take back what I said during the beta Revenant is fun.
Anathema glad you're enjoying it.
I think they improved the skills after the beta.
Well the assassin legendary wasn't in the beta I played too and that is the one I use the most.
Right I really enjoyd the assassin legendary in the 2nd or 3rd beta.
So I am having trouble with this boss everything is against me. dodges are not working camera is nowhere near where it should be.
So I say fuck it and drop the difficulty to normal.
And the boss still oneshots my whole party.
MoonWolf you wanna moderate a twitch chat this evening? v.
How many people are we talking about ?
MoonWolf LINQ and lambdas have spoiled me so badly. When I'm in another language without those tools and I need to do something like filter a collection I'll just stare at the keyboard for a minute thinking uhh how do I do this? with a friggin for loop? Ugh.
Yeah one of those ugly for loops.
Who even likes those.
Stream has 1100 followers.
Overwatch low settings so fuck knows how many people will be watching.
Assuming I can even get it to work.
Can i timeout everyone who uses twitch emotes ?
I'll have nightbot too but I'd rather have someone on station who gets it.
Do they have a way to shadow-ban people?
That's a good idea though.
I love shadow banning.
ChaosSmurf what time you do start ?
Whenever the beta goes up +30 mins probs.
So at current guesses half 6 my time.
It is currently 1219 here.
By half six do you mean 630 or 530 ?
I can do that.
That means thumbs up in Slack emojis.
We should use Discord/Slack/something that isn't IRC.
Maybe if mmoirc dies.
I will point you at it whenever.
Eh no big loss to me.
I'll just play more videogames then.
Instead of watching them.
Was this the thing you wanted to talk about last night ?
If mmoirc dies we can move to another network.
That was me trying to make Github do what I wanted it to.
Among other semi-complex programmy things.
When I was trying to datamine the Overwatch client.
Or we could join this millenium anathema.
Fucked around with it for like 2 hours before giving up I think you maybe can if you can work out how to get a file list to work.
But I couldn't so here we are.
There isn't anything wrong with IRC.
Except for its total lack of functionality and integration I agree.
I'll just trust the fine people at the mmochampion equivalent of overwatch to do it.
You know in the modern world you can just drag and drop images to show them to people? #madness.
MoonWolf yeah I was trying to beat them to it.
This is Overwatch MMOC btw.
And at the moment it's very bad.
We have urls don't need anything else.
Massive waste of clicks time and effort to upload to imgur/elsewhere.
Lack of in-line appearance.
Lack of in-line preview is an advantage.
Well I work in an office half the images posted here are NSFW.
How do I make github give me a different branch of a project?
Rather than just the master one.
On the main page of a project there is a little green button.
There is a dropdown on the top left.
Next to it another that says branch bla.
Select a different one.
Second question compiling C.
That's a complex question on windows.
It shouldn't be and computers are stupid.
What is the repository?
Do you want a link.
What bit do you want to compile?
This is all c# so just get visual studio 2015 community edition open cascexplorer.sln and click 'build'.
Nope done dealing with this games bullshit for now.
That asshole boss is back. With less levels but somehow worse.
Hey if i can beat my bullshit bosses.
Mister my game has good design and i can dodge everythign.
You know everything else I have found a way to dodge.
This guy in tales of zestiria.
Maybe if I dodge the first attack back then sidestep the next one?
At this rate yuru yuri will reach critical mass by the end of this season.
A girl will actually kiss another girl ?
I think this show is too classy for that.
Are you one of those never reboot types.
On the whole yes.
My phones battery is at 6% I've basically not used it.
Got told today by my manager that the company have in the past used the timings provided by our security badges to punish / fire people after explicitly stating they would not be used for that purpose.
Well after a lengthy pause got the boss on my second try.
Anathema my guess would be that they're not actively monitoring them but if they want to fire someone it'll be something they can look at to find an excuse.
So one of my Skype friends is playing the new TOR expansion right now and suddenly I see this in the skype chat OH MY GOD BIOWARE NOT MONTAGE MUSIC Heh.
Anathema the company is good at using any excuse they have -.
And they wonder why hiring good people is hard.
It's also easy to blame others when people resign in my case my team members were told they were a negative influence and made me resign.
Which was completely untrue but they just wanted to blame someone else for their own inabilities.
MoonWolf Triumphat pride precipitates a dizzying fall. - Darkest Dungeon definitely added more lines.
That narrator can narrate at me all day long.
But i do like his lines.
Divinity Originla Sin Enhanced Edition is out btw.
Indeed got it slowly downloading in the background thanks for the heads up though.
Meanwhile in reality Taken from an office across the street to the Paradox one.
Anathema apparantly mic is not working.
Meanwhile in gravity falls ITS STILL HAPPENING.
GlennCuddlefish there's more Gravity Falls? O.
Almost certainly what was the last episode you saw?
I've seen episodes after that.
And I don't think I'm up to date.
MoonWolf so I just tuned in.
What's going on after games with cards and whatnot?
It shows 4 people who had really good game performance.
And you can vote on who you thought was best.
Also MairBear and me are discussing this thing on mumble.
Anathema theres at least..4 to 6 episodes out after that.
Original sin director's cut they watched a shitload of twitch streams and made a new difficulty which countered every strategy they found on there by tweaking encounteres with extra monsters/positioning/hazards while still keeping the old one in. bwahahahaha.
ChaosSmurf it is probably better for all of us that your internet died.
In terms of sleeping and what have you.
I would have been playing until 3.
Did you see the viewer numbers?
The Twitch backend is still broken so I couldn't.
I had full screen most of the time.
But that's the highest I saw.
What's the deal with hooking and shooting?
Shooting ends your hook?
Hook only immobilises for a short time.
After it allows you to shoot.
You can get good one good shot off.
But if they land somewhere weird you can miss.
Also if you forgot to reload before hook you've fucked it?
Man the american streamers are gonna do so well tonight if their servers are still up.
Raking in the ad dosh.
!note MoonWolf ty whenever you wanna do more it will be appreciated.
Noelor are you still awake.
Pls see my last picture tweet.
Actual real rain today in Cambridge wonder how much people will freak out.
Oh I got into the overwatch closed beta?
Incidentally turns out my backpack isn't waterproof and now my wallet is wet.
Also I had a dream where I was buying things at a supermarket and a lady behind me said I was good looking then I ran away to get eggs and broke them because I gripped the boxes too tightly but bought them anyway because I was too anxious.
Get in open the team inbox to look for requests.
First one Payment Excalibur.
I'll arrange payment for a legendary sword today.
Minister seems like a top priority.
Haven't been to the gym in a month stupid injury and my scales at home have ran out of battery power so now I don't know how valuable I am as a person.
Its not that important anathema.
I know I'm not being serious.
Sometimes it hard to tell if you're joking or using humor to disguise the fact that you really do care about that quite a bit.
No wonder these enemies seemed too easy.
I had forgotten the game on hard.
You had forgotten you'd left it on difficult instead of sadistic hellscape.
Usually I would keep it on normal but the drops are better on higher difficulties I think.
Boo they added a 5 second cooldown to a teleport the revenant has I was using that to travel faster.
They hate your fun.
I can see why though its really long range cost 1/5 of the class resource.
These patch notes are not as good as Path of Exiles.
Anathema by that do you maen the formatting or the things its doing.
The things no Fixed a bug where fire damage converted to chaos only affected maximum fire damage not minimum fire damage for fire damage that was converted from cold damage that had been converted from physical damage. This is the description in the programmer's actual commit message. It deserved to be left unsimplified!
That was probably the best bug/fix we'll ever see in game patchnotes.
There should be an award.
Its a weird time we live in when Outsider is actually getting updates.
MoonWolf so you know how there is a standard git commit message format and if you didn't you should look it up.
Visual studio can show git changes now and will show the message in a wee bubble when you hover over a change but the bubble is too narrow and so the formatting gets completely messed up and it is awkward to read. Microsoft.
Ftrbzzs coffee question if I put two cups worth of coffee in a clever dripper but only one cup of water am I wasting coffee or will the one cup be stronger?
I can live with both.
MoonWolf Tuscatsi is aiming for Zenith right?
Or maybe twilight ?
Although having a tiny army of elementals could also work.
Not that there would be a problem if we both end up the same caste.
What's the name of the lady who plays Brienne?
Gwendolyn Christie possibly spelled incorrectly.
I might end up either Dawn or Zenith.
MoonWolf could you put that thing I said about 5s and supernals into the gdoc please?
Somewhere around the point I say how I'm assigning caste.
The thing that'd be a pain in the tits to type out in the phone at work.
Minister where did you have stuff relating to this exalted campaign stored?
Huh fun thing in FFXIV i just got an in-game justification from the alchemist's guildmaster as to why potions have cooldowns.
If you upped the dosage of a potion or drank too many suddenly poison.
MairBear i can't seem to actually get into a match of tavern brawl.
I'm about to try myself.
You get a choice of three cards for your draw.
Thats what they dsay anyway.
Yeah this is just a long long queue that isn't ending guess it's broke.
Oh world championships on playhearthstone.
Player Won the first match of the tournament do you think the rest of the thing will go like this? No no one else will win the first match of the tournament now. ...
Oh neat more official cosplay guides for XCOM2.
Do you still need to be over 18 to look at the official jacket colour of an xcom npc ?
MairBear i finished.
This makes me giggle.
MairBear i can moobl.
I choose to believe this is a Pratchett reference.
Goddamn it Funcom why would you do server maintenance now |.
<- i'd be so dead.
Is this who I am tonight?
ChaosSmurf still watching overs?
I have new glasses and now nothing looks correct.
MoonWolf this week's MinuteEarth which is only on Vessel right now is about the risk of cities flooding.
The first half is just The fucking Netherlands man.
Then there's a brief not even the Netherlands can defeat the coming floods.
Then reveals that actually probably they can.
Coming being next century or two.
I am confused by twitch hosting.
Is there a different chat if I switch to actual Smurf's chanel?
A Terrible Mistake has been made.
My combat theme for today.
Possible boar drifting?
Such a good track.
Interesting. For the purposes of Heroes esports Hong Kong is grouped with Taiwan rather than the PRC.
Both China-not-China islands off the south-eastern Chinese coast.
ChaosSmurf I'm in =D.
Nearly 100 words over budget.
Abbrevs and contractions to the rescue?
I'm just giving it another more proper editting pass.
Did some editting as I transcribed it out of my notebook but there will be more I can do.
Cue me ending up 50 under after edit.
I had one assignment last yr where I was like 10 pages over the limit of 10.
The build behind it was exceptionally graph heavy I didn't see how I could get any compromise or adherence.
Got a good score for it though as the calcs and analysis was sound.
Tbh if you've got to have graphs you've got to have graphs.
Search 'mdn string' to find the mozilla development network page for string objects get amazon ad for mens g-strings and thongs.
Today in reasons JavaScript sucks.
The best way to do a case insensitive comparison in JavaScript is to use RegExp match method with the 'i' flag.
Lets just invoke all of the overhead of RegExp to string compare.
Nevermind the fact that I'd have to escape regex metacharacters.
You like them ?
Just a statement of general frustration at the state of front-end development.
OTOH finally hit 80 last night on my Revenant now I can play the expansion content.
In another 15 years they'll have caught the web browser up to the desktop.
For tools and usability.
Then your webapps will be just as good as general programs.
And this whole thing will have been worth it.
They'd need to fucken replace HTML with something else.
Although once webassembly hits I would not be surprised if people just reimplement win32 or wcf in the canvas.
Well thats not happening.
Then every page load requires 5mb of libs.
But maybe they'll add an equivalent to thats like.
2 of our test projects randomly failed to build literally nothing in them has changed.
Are you going to blame cosmic rays again ?
Don't be ridiculous cosmic rays couldn't cause this.
Ftrbzzs a system with 4GB of RAM can expect to have one bit flipped by cosmic rays every 3 days.
Anathema thats a bit of a big deal the ubuntu thing.
Extra-weird the failed build works fine on my teamcity config just not the main one.
The joys of technology.
MoonWolf does PatternSpider support Ex3?
Anathema it supports it in that it rolls ex2 rolls.
But the complex syntax i'd need to properly support ex3 dice tricks is not wroth the complexity.
But the default unmodified rolls that is regular rolls and damage rolls are identical.
Haha what an ass Coik that is.
Have a camrip of a Nier 2 trailer.
That looks pretty good.
Still involves playing danmaku sections i see.
I am not worried about the gameplay part. I am worried about the writing.
Its going to be a very solid game in the least with a great soundtrack and almost certainly good writing.
Music sounded pretty good.
Can't say much about the writing from a trailer though.
Pretty sure that music was just a nier remix.
Wait might not even have been a remix let me check that.
Actually scratch that no remix. for some reason I remembered an entirely different song having played there.
I blame still not having woken up properly.
Showing 242 changed files with 119 additions and 180801 deletions. fuck yeah.
Will need to find a good tab for this.
<- here is a thing.
I txt'd my dad an awful joke earlier.
And he responded with just an empty sms.
Isn't this supposed to work the other way around.
On the other hand.
I agree with your ad.
My dad and I have different kinds of awful jokes.
Don't leave us in suspense here anathema.
@ Paradox buying WW.
I wonder what the deal is with Obsidian Path now.
They are both just fancy black stone.
MoonWolf dyk if Shirou's swords have names?
Black and white respectively I believe.
This vision will be realized in multiple digital games titles across a full range of media.
The topic dates seem wrong.
MairBear you might be right.
MoonWolf 1455 do not ever let Chris Avellone near anything I like.
1455 dude is a fuckin hack.
Holden calling Avellone a hack.
He's bitter because of KoTOR 2.
Ftrbzzs people keep telling me the new coffee machine in the office can make real esperesso | it looks the same as the old one.
Well that certainly something to learn about when you were at the cafe about WW and Paradox.
Having just bought a 1300â‚¬ espresso machine I assure you the automatic caffeine dispensing machine is nowhere near -.
Huh Aion is on Steam now but apparently region locked.
Here's a noncam version of the Nier 2 trailer for anyone interested.
Everything about those weapons is ridiculous.
Also you get a tiny robot instead of a grimoire.
I hope you can still do ridiculous robot magic finishers.
With giant hands and spears and everything.
Ah that's disappointing SVT started broadcasting a sci-fi documentary series according to an FB post. Turns out I've already seen it a couple of months ago after it aired on BBC first.
You could watch it in Swedish I guess?
What do we think this White Wolf Paradox deal means for Exalted.
So they can hire competent layout people? =p.
Ex3 is one of the nicest RPG books I've ever read.
Did you look at the tables ?
Or the page number position.
Or the fact that two blocks or text are covered by images.
Yes seemed fine not a big deal and actually common adobe tooling mistake and will be corrected.
Perhaps the greatest thing to come out of the collaboration between Square Enix and Platinum is how Taro and Kamiya are now drinking buddies. 'I like drinking with him around the office' he says. 'There's quite a lot of dirty conversation going on.' D.
Hopefully they can hire some actual fucking artists.
The press releases read like there's going to be a fucking cul tho.
ChaosSmurf hopefully they can hire some actual fucking artists - oh yeah that too.
Thankfully they are redoing that awful 3d pose cooking one.
You want this to take another three years? p.
Or maybe 1Â½ now that they might just get more money.
ChaosSmurf most of the art is really good.
Most of the art is passable.
All of it is worse than anything I have ever seen in eg. a Wizards product.
Except for a few specific pieces like the harvest one right at the end.
Huh new DoW2 DLC.
Halloween sale on Steam! O.
Bah no TTS on offer.
Irritating. I thought I was done mass buying the ret dlc's when the sale came around from a few yrs back.
Fuck it's a week until Blizzcon.
SU is on tomorrow right?
I don't think so ?
No arrow this week either.
Constantine is apparently making a cameo on Arrow soon-ish.
This one is still so good.
Man the steam sale seems bad this time.
Disappointed that it didn't offer TTS. I really wanted to get that.
Kinda want it for a bunch of things I want to play.
Especially Marvel Legendary and possibly Warhammer Conquest.
Also first session of Shadowrun Africa now. Currently my character is indesposed while the others meet the new Johnson.
Who shapeshifted from a lion into a human.
I suddenly have a lot more disposable money now that I have my sights set on my cousins old graphics card P.
Oh and the Johnson just went How would you like to make five million nuyen.
Hmm AS2 50% off.
But given what CA's been saying about it might give it a miss.
AS2 is what again?
Oh yeah Audiosurf 2.
If its dirt fucking cheap then sure.
Â£5.50. Not sure what that comes to in Krone P.
So in todays 5th e game with the group that has a competent DM we got a crab submarine almost got it stolen by some kind of magical armor fought an underwater crab battle with some crab man and killed the inn keeper of the only inn at the tower of babel.
To be fair the inn keeper was also a cultist. and a fishman.
Okay so now that i've seen the empire people with their straight up judge helmets.
This game has hella FF12 influences.
Aw yis Shadowrun GM just posted the first in-setting newsletter for Africa.
I think if I get an interview with the SC2 guys at Blizzcon I'm going to ask them how it feels to have their own acronym again.
Wait you're journo-ing blizzcon?
What level are you so far moonwolf.
Eesh. I have some serious catching up to do at some point.
Also now I know why I thought the nier sequel trailer had remixed music.
Because it did before the actual gameplay trailer.
This was also in the nier sequel video.
GlennCuttlefish i wasn't playing very efficiently.
My watch has a magnetically-attached charging cable.
Just now when I plugged it in it vibrated to acknowledge that it was charging.
And shook the cable off.
Smart watch my arse.
Moonwolf even so you are 8 levels above me and I dont really have time to play today.
Passing that onto a friend.
Oh it's apparently its the same kind of spider she has p.
If you look in the video you can see it has soft white fangs after it molts the white is its blood and it takes about two weeks to harden safely before it stops being like jelly the new skin I mean ANd now you know.
MoonWolf you seen this D3 botting stuff.
Writing a news about it now.
Also this is a fucking amazing post.
ChaosSmurf OW servers down right now.
I'm off work in 8 minutes.
US servers work =V.
High Noon is harsh.
!note Noelor this EGSNP has so much hair freakout.
Well I am tempted to lower the difficulty on this boss as well.
I mean its doable I guess but for some reson my second human party member just refuses to revive with the fusion even when its available.
Ftrbzzs new coffee machine is broken already spewing ground coffee onto the floor and into cups.
Lasted less than one day.
That was a quality machine.
England doens't even rate.
Anathema how am I not surprised?
MoonWolf >implying England even has food according to France.
Ftrbzzs I guess you're just such a naturally cynical person.
Anathema maybe you've just been spoiled with really nice coffee and you should just get used to the delicious machine coffee again -.
I did try it this morning before it broke it is much better than the last machine and if they actually used nice beans it might be OK but still doesn't really compare to proper brewed stuff.
Is it from the same company as before the machine?
I assume the front panel is identical the insides are different though.
Finally got that boss down. that attempt alone took me 15 minutes.
And methods that I am not proud of.
You do this to yourself.
Nobody is making you.
Look if I hadn't had to use an all divide I would have no regrets.
All devides to me are for like postgame bullshit stuff.
Does explain the 15 minutes though.
I didnt even activate it until at nearly the end.
When the boss starts going all out.
Also I am pretty sure there are no more than...5 bosses remaining. And i have 14 all divides remaining. And even if I run out I can always buy more.
Prince diamond bad at math.
Next boss wasn't difficult just a bit tedious.
It was too slow to be of any real threat but if it hit it nearly took at least 50% of my health probably more if the stronger attacks hit.
The only guide that was needed.
Get a green amry sweater.
Beard i guess ?
Snaketits cosplay guide when.
.... This is great.
Get some alien alloys build some advent armor be a snek.
MoonWolf that is a gem of a voice pack.
MairBear its the very essence of beagle.
Let me tell you something about Maurader.
Its BORING AS FUCK.
But its at 15 now so in theory i'll neve rhave to do it again.
Unless i want to be whatever mauraders become.
MoonWolf are you being a tank?
Anathema i'm lancering into dragoon.
Figured i'd get it out of the way.
Give GlennCuttlefish a chance to catch up maybe.
Coming at y'all from my flat now.
ChaosSmurf actual info on the SC2 pro at Blizzcon probably?
Noelor yeah trailer I'd guess.
It's so rad right.
MoonWolf though now you're 15 with it you can dungeon.
And queue times are fast.
I'll keep that in mind if i ever want to level it.
I guess now I'll have to look for that next time I play.
And get that map.
Minor things that pleased me today the technician from Virgin who came to install my lines and stuff came in out of the rain and immediately put covers on over his shoes before stepping off my doormat.
Is she in a fucking mech.
IS SHE GOING TO BE IN A GOLIATH.
Overwatch confirmed to be set in Starcraft.
I seriously considered if I should make a Marvel Legendary Encounters solo play app today because I was disappointed at how badly it was emulated in TTS. I gave up on that thought after a minute or so v.
MairBear thijs best hijs.
Oo is their stone'd hearths happening.
Fist match of today juts finished.
Thijs advaced into round of 8.
ChaosSmurf see my latest tweet.
It probably won't be.
Would be perfect followup to Zarya.
Not a support pls.
I agree with you.
But there's a certain frame of reference you need to have for tanks.
Like a tiny thin girl doesn't look like she has a lot of HP.
Hence why I would want her in a big mech thing.
Where's your female body diversity Blizz? Have a body builder Oh sure the big lady is a tank how typical Have a nerd in a mech?
Yeah that would be.
Did her SC2 profile say she plays random?
I don't know if that matters.
If it was Terran.
I'd assume she was a tank.
How many people are not going to realise it's pronounced diva until Blizzcon.
How can you not?
Some people when they see something with punctuation in it.
Just read it as name.
Probably some that try DVA.
I used to a lot.
Anyway Virgin tech's gone.
Like if I couldn't pronounce something easily it just became that name in my head.
Yeah would be surprising if ppl are messing it up from the way it's constructed.
Noelor have you seen Zarya's taunt btw.
They are The Best.
Although fucktonne of esports names set up id's with warped phonic interpretations.
I saw you doing 'hog's on stream with HiggyC? the other day.
BwaS and somet just have arbitrary punctiation and letters meaning basically nothing at all.
She just starts lifting her gun with a smirk.
Didn't remember to check in-game most of the time.
It's all quite *pulls at collar*.
ChaosSmurf its a really good gun.
I didn't realise she did more damage if she absorbed damage until I started playing.
For a long time while we were watching your stream we were utterly bewildered by the absorbed damage meter.
What it did how it went up or down.
If high or low was bad.
Yeah I remember seeing it in her playthrough and having no idea.
It's not really broadcast at all.
It's in her menu as her passive though.
She does Real Damage with it at 100.
Also her black hole + justice.
A line from Undertale without context.
After I turned the stream off.
Now you'll see my real power relying on people who aren't garbage!
Me and HiggyC hit the perfect fucking hole into justice.
It was god damn art.
Onto the last point of anubis.
ChaosSmurf I had not realised you had to jump yourself before Justice.
Spent like two whole games with well.
You don't have to.
Justice raining from the floor.
Jumping isn't always great.
Does it always angle down.
Or can you just shoot straight forward ?
You can 100% aim it.
It does splash onto you if they impact too close tho.
I think they should remove the splash.
Because it's really fucking annoying and a total edge case.
But it might make it broken in some dumb ways I dunno.
I probably killed myself with Justice at least once then.
Justice is blind afterall.
Everyone gets equal amounts of justice.
Did you get in MoonWolf.
This game's bosses are so good.
At least not yesterday.
Let me check the button.
Anathema is in and he doesn't even care.
This MARKETING STUNT they call a BETA eh.
ChaosSmurf i should have just been a streamer.
I have built my desk.
But need a second person to help me turn it right-way-up.
So while waiting for my dad to drive over with some stuff I forgot.
I am sitting with my monitor I only have one over here right now on top of the PC itself.
And my mouse on a stool beside me.
Keyboard on lap obvs.
This is very Just Move House.
Doing it right i g uess.
If you ask some people.
I should have been sleeping on the floor for the last 7 nights.
Instead of on the bed that is in my parents' house.
MoonWolf I played it.
MairBear i can mumb.
ChaosSmurf when you likely to OW tonight?
Is anyone talking in mumble?
Also you are not talking.
I'm not hearing either.
Looks like you moved your computer and therefore the audio drivers broke because that's what happens.
My headset just didn't like me resetting the pc.
Otoh I've now updated mumble to the latest version.
So we started undertale today. We haven't laughed so much in a while.
I hadn't even seen some of those the things on my first playthrough.
MoonWolf in a little bit.
Need to get food.
Also reset my pc yet another time.
GlennCuttlefish I made more progress in Undertale today too!
Pacifist is the best tbh.
Or I wouldn't know I never really could convince myself to do a genocide run.
My computer things are all on a desk.
Thats all p good.
So apparently it's possible to play Marvel Legendary on roll20 but I haven't found out how yet.
Also Magic as well vOv.
MairBear/MoonWolf give me a ping when y'all finish your round?
Literally as i speak victory appears on screen.
ChaosSmurf actually going to bed instead of OW.
Noelor what a cunt.
Have a Chocobo.
Easy on the explosions there rangers.
Well I just noticed my water fusion has this games tidal wave.
Actually I noticed that during yesterdays dragon boss fight but still.
GlennCuttlefish but can you bla bla bla ?
Err. depends. the way it works is that there is this kind of rock paper scissors system going on in this game.
So if an enemy attacks me with a certain type of attack while I am casting it the cast bar progresses about 50%.
Just realised I have 0 plates or bowls.
Upon which to food.
That seems one of the obvious ones.
I need a microwave too.
Just generally kitchen stuff.
GlennCuttlefish You wanna go fast?
Well I already had ascend which is good enough for going fast.
Might get the first tribes and see if somehow miraculously there is a TAC server still up.
Cooked_Auto Premiere has outputted a 13 minute 720p video at 3 gigs.
I don't think so.
Do you still have saved output settings from when you did vids?
Because as far as I can remember you always start with raw encode to lossless like huffyuv or lagarith and then convert it to an mp4 container.
Ah that might be the issue.
Well whatever it's going to youtube now.
I've got premiere cs3 installed so hang on.
Internet is beastly so it'll only take 13 minutes.
I remember that uploading to YT tanked my bandwith because it took essentially as much download as it wanted which was really weird.
But yeah look up either lagartih or huffyuv codecs and install that. So going raw to lossless to an YT compatiable mp4 is what I used at least.
When I actually had stuff recorded and not ripped from streams.
The WoW pre-Blizzcon stream has finally realised that 3v3 arena mirrormatches are dull to watch.
They have switched to 6v6 WSG.
Cooked_Auto it also refused to output a 720p file.
So it output a 480p file that looks like a 720p file when fullscreen.
Yeah don't look at me. I used CS3 and Im sure you grabbed something way newer.
And despite all the sources being perfect 169 has black bars on teh side.
Yeah this is whatever the latest is.
Though it's a trial version so fuck knows.
I tried to pirate it and it worked until I turned the internet back on.
Do premiere projects need all their source files to work.
If you want to load them later on you still need the video files available.
I see why people have TB hard drives.
If you use MSI afterburner you can turn down the filesize a bit but if you use Fraps you will get raw video and that gets big fast.
So the source files are pretty titchy.
Oh. I tried using OBS to record once. Realized I couldn't do shit with the mp4 it spat out.
Premiere handled it fine.
Spliced about 17 different things together.
Played with the audio etc.
This one was the one I recorded on OBS with 3k kpbs.
Well just a tester anyway.
I have some serious glare on my screen atm.
Because of window positions and so forth.
So I'm constantly wagging my head back and forth to actually read things.
Also hot damn a Prequel update.
What is this strange age.
Oh well then.
The boat side story was pretty good.
Don't worry prequel guy.
You're stillu pdateing more than mspaint adventures these days.
Villagers now can have black hair. patch notes dot tee ecks tee.
ChaosSmurf your sound is very slightly desynched from your video.
GlennCuttlefish invested some time into learning how to macro in FF so now i should be marginally less bad at healing.
MoonWolf I added a bunch of brackets to everyone's macros in OtS and Herithia's in tGAO so all the maths should disappear from dice rolls.
Related how many magical items do we have as a party in OtS? 3?
Either 2 or 3.
Oh as you're here CA is one of those items a magical rapier/dagger/whatever that Kait's using?
Would you like me to add the bonus into all your macros?
While I'm in here.
I know I added it to the roll20 charsheet if anything.
The character sheet doesn't track all the numbers it ideally should.
But I've now added a weapon bonus value of 1 to Cait's behind-the-sheet statline and incorporated it into all her attacks except for throwing and icebreath.
Related how many magical items do we have as a party in OtS? 3? <- something like that we need more.
Can I try rolling my High Druid dice at the top of the next session to bullshit the forest granting me some sort of magical item-shaped boon?
Turns out you can't.
Not even the enemies of the Archmage like æœ¨ enough to give her a holy symbol.
Let's see if the Prince of Shadows feels that Caitlyn has been nice.
MoonWolf probably likes 5s too.
MoonWolf want to win a HS game for me?
Finally won a game of OW \o/.
MairBear sorry going off to make food like right now.
MairBear if you're still here i have time for 1 or two games in now that i'm just waiting for stuff to be done.
Lol DOSEE has seperate collectable cards.
MoonWolf taunt is cheat.
Nah i saw it earlier today too.
Not sure what his deck is.
But apparantly i'm the agro today.
A rank 20 deck xD.
The new ladder isn't even a day old.
I was not paying attention to my hand there.
GlennCuttlefish I just finished more story quest last night.
Playing like a damn fiddle intensifies.
GlennCuttlefish if you're around and feel like mmos.
We should od that other dungeon.
Brought my second screen over after dinner @ my parents'.
Noelor i don't why not.
And the wide one.
The third is the one attached to an arm instead of a base.
That's still not been moved.
Anathema such a scrub.
Of course darth jar jar.
!note MoonWolf the rotating arrows above mob mean you're auto-attacking it.
From a changelog Close button not hidden when tabs are tiny tiny tiny.
Adobe added tabs to acrobat.
Thta only took 20 years.
Also a new icon.
The UI has been metro-ised.
Yes. This is amazing.
Ive got lots of charts is probably the last thing I want to hear from a DM.
Depends on what you're playing.
I re-used the cert hash and appid when recreating the ssl certificate is that OK?
No no i don't think thats okay.
MoonWolf long but good.
You were not kidding about long.
Wonder how many people are gonna buy painting supplies because of Twitch.
What did twitch do now.
Oh yeah that thing.
Maybe i'll hop on the bandwagon and doodle something while watching that.
Currently he is holding a baby owl.
I didn't know why it said I was 3 commits behind so I just pushed anyway.
People in this company.
It said that because you were THREE COMMITS BEHIND.
Whats not to get.
He didn't think he should have been from what I overheard. The actual issue was tracking the wrong upstream branch or something.
Now he has 2 merge commits in his local branch that aren't in master of the remote.
This is the person whose whole job is sorting out the builds for one of our products.
Your own consciousness is the only one to which you have direct access deep yo.
Unless you have direct access to another one.
In that case james randi has 1 million dollars for you.
So the author of Artemis Fowl is writing a book about Iron Man.
Somehow I'm having trouble deciding on a character for Exalted what a shock.
I for one am filled with suprise.
Who knew this day would come.
Warcraft movie trailer this week on Friday apparently.
Dob did you see your sister's latest tweet?
Dont think it's the first time.
But I dont know the circumstances of this one.
Hellfishing - Fishing trait that allows you to cast your line into magma.
MoonWolf the 5 grim patrons.
Its great everything about that video is great.
Fffuuuuck made dinner too soon.
New yuru yuri wont be out for another 8 minutes.
It is misty as fuck today.
Anathema just dark and clody here.
No fixed landline takes its toll have to go outside to entertain myself!
You have to go outside to get on the internet?
Nah can get 4g inside but can't do much with a tablet.
But we're going to view a flat tomorrow and if it's nice we'll move in on the 23rd or so.
Will you be able to play GW2 then?
Cooked_Auto> Kirisu <- reasonably sure you have linked that to me before.
And yeah that HS machinima was pretty gold.
Ftrbzzs do anything on friday?
Planned my nanoerimo novel and have been writing that since sunday now.
ChaosSmurf have you read Pip's Warcraft poster article today?
Meiling rolls 12 dice to Tits and Cecelyne well then.
Elegant Saber rolls 11 dice to see the thing 14363 105314 2 2 successes.
You suck at seeing.
Am I chanelling GlennCuttlefish here or what?
Looks a bit like it.
Its a good anime.
Of course a decent portion of these are german.
I am all over jouska.
Blizz are pre-vetting their wow qa panel this yr crowdsourcing the selection process.
Unsurprisingly there's some dire ones in there.
Oh gods I've been running long distance tech support for the past couple of hours now over skype.
Haha that interests list.
!note Noelor I have no known plans then sounds good.
Well that's a bummer Shadowrun put on hold due to GMs computer giving up the ghost.
However most 90% sea ley lines seem to be located in the deep oceans. Roughly 40% of the ley lines in the Atlantic Ocean poke above the waves while less than 10% radiate from the Pacific many are miles below the surface. RIFTS.txt.
!note Noelor are you doing a chargen session or should we already be made for the 13th?
I was thinking this final boss was too easy since I killed 2 first forms with hald damage accidentally on.
And then the third form has twice the HP of any boss I have seen so far including the optional bosses.
....how the hell am I supposed to do this.
There is a phase where I have to deal enough damage to stun the boss but I just cant do it.
Get.. better.. stuff ?
And reset 2 tedious phases? Nah. I'll just lower the difficulty. I have seen all this boss has to offer I think just due to mechanics I cant pass a dumb DPS check.
OR I might be dumber than a baboon and miss a mechanic in this fight.
Is that a guess or did you just figure it out ?
Holy shit less than a minute on this queue for a lancer.
Must be my lucky day today.
Passed will vs ffxiv.
That is not a bad question.
I'd like people to have characters at least ready enough to rp that week but a decent portion of play will be introducing the characters to each other both ic and ooc.
And possibly rounding out backgrounds ability deficits intimacies to other PCs etc.
I'm trying to find tuscatis old sheet but i can't.
Where did we keep those ?
A git backed wiki I hosted that I think is lost.
Because I'm a bad sysadmin.
Time to go find that image again then.
There a couple of unmounted partitions in the server that might have old OSes.
Its not a big deal.
Rebuidling my old onenote character sheet layout for Exalted 3.
Broke my nice 5x5 grid.
Plain test is the way to go.
Anathema this is much nicer than only text.
Also since these notebooks now live online i can link them to others.
Okay that didn't link to where i wanted to.
!note Noelor How do I Sorcerer a mortal.
!note Noelor nvm found it it way lower down than it should be.
!note Noelor as a mortal do i need a second merit to also thaumaturge or do i get it for free with my Shaping Ritual.
This is rad.
MoonWolf iirc your ritual lets you sorcerous working which should more than cover any thaumaturgy?
Cooked_Auto pretty sure gimble will think that will make for a good esport.
Great. now my wrists broken.
I haven't read thaumaturgy yet though if it's somehow a bunch easier than workings then yeah it's probs a separate merit purchase.
Well not broken as in bones shattered and such.
Just feels like whatever mystery thing affects my foot at times.
Nah its more like the tendons are too tight.
This list upsets me.
2 was the best one.
With The Burning Name.
I can just throw firebolts all the time.
No need to get a weapon.
Okay game we have a deal.
A deal with an ifrit?
Weather you have some.
You seem to be sharing weather Cooked_Auto.
I am on the train with what seems to be Newcastle uni's entire women's lacrosse team.
I didn't even know they had a lacrosse team.
Unis have a team for everything.
Let alone enough lacrosse for gender-aggregated teams.
...aggregated is not segregated.
Make Archer puns in their hearing.
MairBear are you ready to beat up someone in co-op ?
MoonWolf I'd love to play more webspinners yes.
!note noelor I am usually back by 9GMT on fridays is that too late?
MoonWolf you spelled 'strength' and 'bureaucracry' wrong in Tuscatsi's sheet.
>two attributes at 1.
Anathema too busy to do sorcery to do any lifting or manipulating.
The strength I see but manipulation seems kinda necessary for a cult leader / sorceror? >_> just a thought.
Maybe i'll buy it with the leftover BP.
Friend posted on Facebook today that she's finally married to her wife and I'm not sure if how weird that clause is says good or bad things about lgb rights in the UK.
Don't suppose anyone spoke out against the 13th while I've been offline this evening?
Also unrelated MoonWolf did you see how fucking Jet Set some of LÃºcio's tags are?
There is no way they DIDN'T know.
Someone did that on hella purpose.
Similarly CA did you see Torbjorn's set.
Kirisu i have questions.
Also here is a cute thing.
I havent really checked much OW stuff out- oh gods.
CA yeah s'pretty Swede-racist.
No. It's pretty damn clichÃ©.
Even if I admit they got the IKEA instruction ones pretty good.
That said I can't even remember which of his o's gets the accent.
Probably not. At best you'd need Peter Stormare for that.
MoonWolf yes cute indeed.
CA I meant it's TÃ¸rbjorn or TorbjÃ¸rn or maybe an umlaut and idk which.
Because I can't Swedish.
Because use Ã¸ makes it danish.
And yeah they're pretty good IKEAs.
So where were you on the train to/from then?
Metro from work to town.
4LE to Jesmond because obviously to Jesmond.
The lacrosse players that is. the lacrosse players were to Jesmond.
Noelor if I take the The Burning Name merit from the Ifrit Lord initiation could i use Thrown Charms on those ?
So long as you're also using the Thrown ability sure.
That seems to be the point of the Thrown tag.
You can throw this using Thrown which no longer looks like a word.
So if i throw fires with int + thrown.
That means i can lob fireballs all day and if i really want to blow someone up summon a giant firebird on top of them.
I'd like you to think about Tuscatsi's pact btw.
What did she do to impress a lord of the fire courts? why was she there? does she have a standing debt to the lord who granted her power? will that still stand when she exalts?
I have deliberatly left all umh fluffy bits blank for now.
Just throwing out questions that it'd be useful to at least think upon.
Also does she still have a cult/tribe?
GlennCuttlefish and MairBear want me to stop chattin gin irc instaed of doing damage.
So if you oculd mumble.
Noelor Bad news it's black.
But wait here's a white one even.
I'm also not *that* into Mulan.
As kickin' rad as she is.
MoonWolf look upon these works.
I cannot summarise this.
Oh yeah a friend of mine linked that in another IRC channel.
CA yeah it was on SUSD's news yesterday.
GlennCuttlefish 9 is fine given it's Friday I should think.
Also my friend informed me last night that Darth Vader's official EoTE stats are that he has no stats and automatically can kill any character within two range bands of himself To which the future GM answered That rules applies to all darths.
Drop a star destroyer on him.
From more than 2 range bands away.
MoonWolf Flight is *probably* worth two actions to a solar to cast given it also so long as you cast it at high enough initiative sets the target on fire for an additional 4L/round which is also rolled against anyone close enough.
Like maybe not something you cast every single battle or to finish every opponent but when you do need to properly fuck something/one up.
Final Fantasy wasn't nerdy enough so they threw in a binary joke.
Noelor I can't do later than 11 UK time.
You and Glenn get to fight over who's playing I guess.
I'm being flippant because I'm on my way out of the flat but I'll think about it.
Not nearly enough forehead.
Latest Unsounded well then. >_O.
Cooked_Auto he had it coming.
!note MairBear it took me too long to realise Kitty is Cheryl.
Bah. I hate it when I get a short fragment of a musical track that has no lyrics in my head.
Pretty sure that websites to help you find music based on you humming the music.
Based on a seconds fragment that is just intense violins?
Even so found it already.
Did Ana and Glenn actually fight?
What would even be the point.
I mean it seems neither of us are going to budge anyway so I think its up to the rest of the group?
Given the job of choosing I'm leaning toward playing earlier ie with Ana.
For mainly these reasons going to bed earlier is still nice on Friday I'm already playing in two games with Glenn.
Dunno how good either of these are but maybe one could be noted @ Mair?
That spreadsheet one looks alright the other one looks useless.
Dragons and other special characters can no longer be castrated by bone mountains rulers.
The header image image for that Tumblr is literally a pornographic cgi gif.
Oh I didn't even see the header for that one so my bad on that I guess.
Cant stop the tank train.
All i have to do is stop pressing E GlennCuttlefish.
We can all make love to the floor instead.
And if you do that what happens?
You are easily the third habitual mmo healer to share that in my sphere of vision.
Though the only one I've actually been healed by.
Also meant to go get hot dog stuff. still to leave the house. store closes in 10 minutes.
French fries it is.
Dps is overachivers tanking is for people who want to go fast healing is for cynics.
You said you were going to do that 2 HOURS AGO.
But I prefer dps over tanking and I definitely want to go fast.
And then I didn't.
Did you unlock haukke yet moonwolf.
No because i've been trying to come up with cool stuff for tonight and failing.
Who would be terribly upset if tonight did not happen ?
I'd be merely slightly annoyed since I did not prepare for game dinner after all.
T'would be a shame but I'd not be upset as such.
Goddamnit my finger is infected on top of everything.
MoonWolf tavern brawl? D.
GlennCuttlefish hangnail infection?
MairBear give me about 30 minutes ?
I'll try one with a rando then.
Moonwolf so it seems. Time to dig up my lighter disinfectant and a scalpel.
Whats wrong with a needle ?
Well I have a scalpel closer by.
MoonWolf we both lost the battle.
I got the pack anyway.
Yeah they changed the pack rules this time.
Probably because its really hard ?
Even if my ally didn't play optimally.
Kept throwing weak minons into him so his bombs hit us in the face c.
His moves are random as far as i can tell.
I think he is a cheat with assassinate at least.
MairBear mumble for this raidboss ?
Wore my glasses when I got home to read something took them off to cook lost them found them after 10 minutes of search in the pile of dirty laundry.
Don't have to stress about getting stuff done.
The new minister for energy and climate change Andrea Leadsom who said one of her first questions on taking up her post was â€œis climate change real?â€.
Maaaaybe she was testing her ministry?
She won't have been but I can pretend to be optimistic okay.
Cooked_Auto turns out that header I was talking about only appears on mobiles.
Because tumblr's the fucking worst.
So you're entirely forgiven.
I mean I know its a NWS tumblr in this case but I did try to make sure it was worksafe so.
Oh ok the wallrun's actually really good if you're not a scrub.
It's for Solars so there's a handful of things to amend if you use it.
Don't have to stress about getting stuff done <- thats one oway of looking at it ?
I have only just started eating.
I just looked at lucio wallriding.
You can just wallride up forever.
Noelor it made me request permission.
That would be that email I just got.
You could also have Made a Copy.
Big event boss in GW2 client crashes.
Instance is probably full now.
>play a StarCraft assassin.
>Raynor is on rotation but so is Zeratul.
Play some of both.
Zeratul all the way.
Now I'm gonna read Ex3 combat system.
These flurry changes are the best thing.
Apparently flurry charms are now op.
Not bad certainly better than the monty python shirts on offer.
The charms chapter starts with an entire page beating you over the head with the fact that charms aren't IC.
Noelor they really hated that in 2e.
Noelor there's a sidebar about it too.
Why is the dog on fire ?
MoonWolf have you ever wondered how 32-bit visual studio can debug 64-bit applications?
You don't need to be a 64 bit program to analyze 64 bit machine code ?
But you can set breakpoints and inspect values and pointers and jazz.
The real answer is.
I really need to buy Raymond Chen's book.
What's a Sotha Sil again?
Sotha Sil or Seht wizard-mystic god of the Dunmer is the least known of the divine Tribunal. He is known as the Father of Mysteries Magus Magician Sorcerer Tinkerer Clockwork God the Light of Knowledge and the Inspiration of Craft and Sorcery.
Listening to Do It For Her because I was looking for another song starting with 'do' that isn't on my phone.
Amazing Does contain a lot of shirtless men.
Connie Maheswaran has been added to my pile of soar exalted concepts.
Maybe lunar? Totem though.
Amazing Post is worksafe site itself should also be but ahead warning is given regardless.
How shit Tumblr is on mobiles is clearly meant to drive people to get the app.
Except I don't have a Tumblr account.
No idea only really browse them on my desktop.
So it just results in me being super mad about out.
Yeah stick with that tbh.
Look at that kid go. Puts Ezio to shame.
He didn't do a single user story or scrum meeting how agile is he really?
Among the things that are shit about mobile Tumblr.
If you click a link to a post on pc you get that post and its comments right?
If you tap it on mobile you get that post and then all previous posts in that Tumblr's timeline.
And also gifs and vids are dodgy.
Mobile browsing is pretty shit.
What I'm saying is are any of the tumbles you browse NOT nsfw.
Idiots loading 5mb of JS and stylesheets.
Minister A whole bunch. p Let's just say the source one was horribly designed.
But I might not have scrolled down to a sketch of someone masturbating in front of a mirror?
If that's not what it was then w/e I backed straight out.
And it's entirely Tumblr's fault to be clear.
GlennCuttlefish never trust that man.
MoonWolf spot my completely stupid mistake for your own enjoyment.
I don't see it.
Look at the else clause.
Then look at what block it is inside.
Although since you didn't spot it immediatly I feel less stupid D.
Glad help you improve your self esteem.
Just found another bug in the same function where I was checking the id of the permission record instead of the role id in the record.
While zestiria is not my overall favorite tales game it does have a pretty good OST now that I listen to it.
MoonWolf did you progress in FF14 today?
Ready for the next dungeon leveled pugilist to 15 to pick up meditation and inner release.
Since apparantly those are the good cross class traits.
Going to have to thaumaturge to 26 for swiftcast over the weekend.
Guess I'll play ff then.
I'm not sure mairbear is even going to wake up today.
Perhaps not but its either finishing that horrible dungeon in zestiria or progressing ff14 story.
Last weeks 13th Age fight.
Oh brayflox unlocked sooner than I expected.
GlennCuttlefish yeah its not that bad.
Except for the whole back and forth nonsense.
Actual new news about xcom2 for once in the last few months.
Oh Minister/Noelor has updated to a Herithia alt name.
Chrome has its own internal task manager?
MoonWolf for some reason pachobells cannon is associated with you in my head.
I'm not sure why.
Damn I was hoping you would.
Does liking it count ?
Am i the only person you know who likes cannon in D ?
So the tab I got.
The question is more wtf event cause the pressure to eject that.
Or to put it another way.
Youtube working for anyone else?
Seems to be loading pretty slow.
Even I don't even.
Yeah thats beyond me.
I don't know what 'disses' means.
According to comments it's a mixtape people made and recorded themselves rapping over.
And the raps consisted of insulting people you knew.
I'm glad scots have a word for that.
'dissing' is insulting someone didn't know people recorded an insulting rap.
Grmbl what is it with minced beef around here these days.
It starts to go slightly off like 3 days before its expiration date. I mean you can still cook it for safe consumption but it has to be seasoned with mountains of salt and pepper.
Guess I should start freezing ity.
Do you hear the people sing?
Apparently V's trying to storm Buckingham Palace.
BwaS i hope they're not singing that thats a great way to all get horrible put down a fe wdays later.
Given they didn't even sing it at Place de la Republique for Je Suis Charlie it would be a long stretch for this one.
There's no 1812 overture either.
Are they even trying.
Well I have now finished zestiria.
While the DLC did bring some nice characterization to some of the PC's I wish I hadn't over all.
Since the main game finishes the plot perfectly and this DLC ends in a horrible cliff hanger.
Also that dungeon was bad.
New pitch A Solar who recreates creation by giving speeches about interesting but mostly irrelevant topics in order to build intimacies and webs of influence.
GlennCuttlefish i renamed my chocobo.
Hello new character silhouettes.
Thats a pretty shoddy photo though.
The good thing about the silhouettes they use though.
Is they're really distinctive in whatever.
Like I can tell that's Junkrat being cut off on the right.
And even Winston on the left who's only a sliver.
This might be better.
That's the current set.
You can see it's everyone's hair and distinctive headgear and I really dig it because it just works.
But on the thing you linked there are others.
I can identify all of those.
So yea they are good.
Noelor i really like that bastion icon.
MoonWolf the bird is so =3.
I see the cyborg ninja.
And then there's... some sort of fashion lady maybe?
Could be this character.
I saw that on twitter and assumed it was a stage tease but.
GlennCuttlefish so black mage is basically balance druid.
Sorta except BLM is actually fun.
Same idea behind the moving buff between damage and regen though.
É›ªçƒ = xue qiu or snowball.
Which had best be a nickname for a yeti.
If someone wants to talk on mumble i have levels to grind and no anime or lp's to watch.
Then watch something new?
Well since I promised 1812 earlier...
MairBear I need to watch and learn from a friend.
MoonWolf uhhhh maybe later feeling a bit bitter at RNGstone.
Lost 8 games before I won 3 >.>.
Went down to rank 19.
MoonWolf okay I'm gonna try one or two matches.
Come mumb so I can be mad.
Heroes of the Storm - Tracer Hero.
MoonWolf chapter 55 of Gunnerkrigg then.
Anathema thanks for taking my brain away from writing I was about to melt.
Ftrbzzs how many words have you done so far?
What are you writing ?
MoonWolf I'm attending the national novel writing month goal is to produce a 50k piece by the end of this month.
Anathema almost at 10k.
So you're just about where you should be assuming 1.6k words a day.
Except you don't write a story 1600 words a day and then done.
Editing can be done in december.
But the goal is to have 50k words done by the end of november and then you have december for editing -.
If you dare to look at what you're written that is.
I bought a microphone today.
Intend to record myself playing some things and the microphone built into my mac does not cut it.
Since I can't play in front of people but I can probably play in front of a camera and then show people.
I think it's a solid idea.
Send me the link when you make your first one.
Also anything which helps me be understood on mumble is a bonus.
I've always heard you fine on mumble.
Ftrbzzs have you watched Burnistoun?
Anathema but I did have a great moment when I was able to watch Broadchr.
Was surprised to hear Tennan go Scottish after seeing him as the Doctor.
Objectively the best burnistoun sketch.
Will teach you lots of new words.
Awesome! will have to watch when I get back from writing in the cafe.
You and your free time.
That's going to end very quickly come Monday.
I'll be tossed around in various trainings flown to Munich London and Stockholm.
And you thought you had escaped the UK.
I remember this... song from Burnistoun way too often.
Because it's somehow still relevant.
Cork is really cool.
Cork feels weird in my hand.
One day spent stuck on a bug.
Because I gave a table the wrong primary key.
MoonWolf because of programming it takes me longer to work out how to turn a major chord into a major 7 chord.
Did you start from 0?
As we know from ChaosSmurf parts of this could be deliberate misinformation.
The Blizzard Ruse cruise have sailed alongside the hype train.
He literally never logs onto irc any more.
Just message him on steam/bnet/whatever.
I don't have those things at work!
Well then idk wait?
Iirc it's possible to trade from 2 to 3.
It's just a pain.
I sent it on facebook.
Oh yeah he's on that.
MoonWolf a Chosen of Lytek would probably be someone who can spin tales of heroism into genuine power to temporarily bestow on others and act as a power amplifier for other Exalts and on his own would basically be just a really basic low-end badass.
Remind you of anyone?
Fucking holden STEALING MY CHARACTERS.
OC DO NOT STEEL.
Oh no not Donut Steel D.
Jet fuel can't melt donut-steel beams?
Orange County Donut Steel. Top class.
You could always try to convince Smurf to buy one of those for you if they're available at Blizzcon P.
I mean it'll be on their swag store.
Literally every time I want to login to arenanet account management I hve to reset my password.
Anathema its super secure.
We were just talking about you.
Anathema what's the address of the server that my IRC is hosted on now.
Is it still theanathema.com.
What's the command to liste screens again.
Something something fragile masculinity?
And what's the one to load screens.
Insert man woman command line joke.
Only 4 days ago.
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHERE I AM.
If you say London I'll cut you.
Though I was there for like an evening.
See any good bins?
ChaosSmurf you know how all of the OW characters have those silhouette symbols that are just their hair and/or distinctive headgear?
Someone found a new one which is probably the explorer lady whose blog went up on the OW site last week.
I think I saw it on Overpwn.
I still hate that site's name.
Did you see D.va and her giant pink mech on the collector's edition.
ChaosSmurf how prepared are you for people to get that name wrong.
Oh so that's what it was.
I'm going to pronounce it like DEE VAH.
Noelor it's on Overpwn.
I mean that's more right.
That's what it looks like anyway.
Just pronounce it D.V.A.
Be utterly wrong in every way.
Be like kripperian and hearthstone.
Which is what I foresee.
Oh man that thing is bigger than reinhart.
Also that's an updated version of the poster I have as my wallpaper I think.
ChaosSmurf it has a Razer symbol on it.
Even fighting for the fate of the world she must maintain her sponsorships.
Even when embroilled in redeeming her best friend now corrupted she must maintain her sponships.
Or maybe she is the one corrupted by her sponsorships?! O.
Clearly OWs plot is all metacommentary about e-sports.
Is there a better pic of it somewhere?
I need to head to the store and get some Ts at some point.
There was a pic that was zoomed in further on the new icons.
The hype is real.
I'm so glad I get to watch the Warcraft trailer in this crowd.
<- from yesterday may 404 for you.
I dunno how long my chrome caches for.
4chan has a weeklong archive now.
So that shot is Mercy D.Va / Winston Cyberninja Junkrat / Bastion Hanzo / 47 ¿Mei? / Reinhardt's horn.
I think Mei's left arm is on that box shot too.
Or someone else new?
Holy damn those contacts.
Virtual tkt has new hosts this yr. these might be an improvement.
Actual start is what 20 mins?
Yeh top of the hr.
It's going to be sad when the Doctor Strange movie won't have anything as amazing as this.
Although those snakes like a pair of cool bros.
Bloody water benders.
She's not a support.
Unless that trailer was very cunning.
Looked defenderish to me.
With a toggle to mobile.
She has 500 HP.
She ults out of the mech.
And then back into it.
Ulting out makes it blow up for massive damage.
I saw it as ult switches her between?
Apparantly this guy was posted about.
One of the guys on my site.
Has managed to fuck up /doing a liveblog/.
He's doing it like 20-30 minutes behind.
The first question at the SC2 panel was will there be more races in SC3.
Just imagine that is my answer to every dumb question that is asked.
ChaosSmurf didn't they crowdsource these ?
How did this get through.
I think I found the problem here.
I know it is for the wow qa which I think is tomorrow.
I don't think all of the q's will be polled from the external crowdsource.
So maybe the sc one is open.
Genn greymane master skin he bought a hat!. Master skins in a nutshell.
Heroes dev making me feel old I was in high school seeing a vanilla wow april fools joke!
I played D.Va and I'm so happy to be alive.
Blizzcon now as a scheduling app for smartphones.
Effective as it operates offline and gives you ETC notifications when the event you want is near.
I want to marry Ben Brode.
I have an interview with him tomorrow and I'm worried I'll just call him great for 10 minutes.
While yes he is.
Please don't do that.
If you have any question ideas.
Do pass them over.
I don't have my notebook with me so can't remember what I already wrote down.
10 minutes is like 3 questions though so.
Ask if this very speedy release with no buildup of this adventure had to do with the feedback of the community recently.
The awnser will probably be no even if its yes though stupid PR.
I may work that in ty.
For over a year now.
This trailer is the best yet.
Snowball is Mei's drone buddy.
MEKA is an acronym because of course v.
D.VA's ulti quote is nerf this =V.
A star charm hanging off her pistol handgrip 3.
The world's longest rap.
Better than the rap!
I agree with that title.
On Varian in the cinematic Pictures of 40 year old white males that worked in the office were used for reference.
So mostly Metzen again? =p.
Overwatch Mei is mad adorable.
No luck with overwatch so far but hey I did get into the tree of savior beta.
Also didn't want to sleep anyway.
Oh man tree of saviour.
Want to try that too.
GlennCuttlefish sleep is for the weak ?
Well I am old and weak.
You... slept though right?
Did you out mair me?
Well yes I did sleep.
So the HS t hread on SA gained 400 posts.
Lets NOT read those.
They spoiled all the cards at the panel.
Not very many of them seemed playable.
Noelor livespoiled them for me.
It looks like a whole lot of neat i guess this is actually bad and a handfull of useful in an existing deck.
Which is basically the whole problem HS has right now.
Discover kicks the shit out of their other recent mechanics tho so A+.
I thought we liked HS spils.
Wish I had more than 10 minutes with brode.
I'm just concerned they really need to start doing something like formats.
Like right about now.
Because the powercreep is real.
MairBear they fixed a big D3 problem.
They are replacing the fucking massive numbers with Million and Billion.
I have those guys for a but tomorrow as well.
Damage numbers are now shortened with k M or B.
Every Season Journey that you play will give you a new Stash Tab for up to 10 tabs the first of which will be available right away with 2.4.
Gonna aska bout botting but dunno otherwise.
Need to look through Diablofans and see what they said at the panel.
This patch ended up bigger than i thought.
Might need to see if i can pirate tis panel.
I bunmped into one of the community guys getting burgers and it sounded enormous.
An expansion has to be coming.
I guess that's question 2.
If they are willing to drop this much just free actual level based content into the game.
Fucking announce the damn thing blizzard.
Just see what they have to say when I go so where's the expansion chaps.
You really want to.
But its a waste of your interview time.
We'll see if I have stuff from the patch to discuss.
But they might answer in a way that has interesting followups.
So I maybe get an answer to why hasn't it been announced yet.
I can go the whole the community oddly considers the game abandoned - why do you think that is too.
But 15 minutes so.
I've got 30 with the WoW guys.
And fuck all to say.
Should have switched your 30 wow minutes to one of the other categories.
I don't have an OW interview at all.
So I just talked to the devs that were helping with the press area for like 2 hours.
I have also now written 6 paraagraphs about Mei.
More than I have about Genji or D.va.
Despite those being the two I actually like.
This may be too many paragraphs.
New stash tabs woo.
MairBear get fucked for new characters.
Yeah I dunno how long this is.
New Cube Recipe Permanently upgrade an Encient Items by sacrificing a Legendary Gem and a regular Gem. It will add 5 of the corresponding main stat per rank of the Legendary Gem that you used. <- i don't think this is a good idea.
It just pushes mindless endgame grind.
I guess th epeople who like getting into the grift leaderboards like it ?
<- everything about this page is exceedingly my jam.
ChaosSmurf if you have the time ask them why they still have not added the nemesis system to PC for diablo.
Cause they have not.
MoonWolf did you unlock Titan btw.
No but i unlocked that side dungeon.
And i got arcanist to 26.
But then there was blizzcon.
It can't take long to unlock titan.
Well thats a mod.
Second hotline mod Ive seen.
Queue for Trial roulette.
Get a boss that takes 114.
Aaaaah I couldn't find baking soda in tescos.
I didn't see it in the baking aisle.
My mic arrived though.
Might need to get a usb hub...
They've all got stylesheets on the official site.
Including a 4th page for weapons.
Her pistol has a bunny charm hanging from the grip.
Some of these control spell effects are fun.
Cirrus Skiff never has to be cast again!
First semi-final for Heroes... delayed start as one of the teams can't figure out how to log in to the teamspeak server.
Disqualify them for incompetenec.
GM is explaining dice.
Picked 2 yellow 1 black.
And the black dice - I mean the minority dice - is the stunt dice.
One of these casters is wearing a grey tie on a blue shirt. The one next to him is wearing a blue tie on a grey shirt.
Has to be on purpose.
First attack of the campaign.
I bisect a bandit with my greatsword =D.
PatternSpider> Noelor -- 655 <- my 3d6 damage roll.
The time slot for the heroes SF started over 2hrs ago. Still borked.
Still not logging into mumble properly?
I don't think they're cool enough for mumble.
Think their only opening is piggyback their guild's ventrilol and they're raiding tonight and might not be letting them in.
BwaS how the fuck is that even happening.
Its not hard to host one of those things.
If i was the tech on site i'd have BOUGHT ONE RIGHT THERE.
Get this shit on the road.
We can spend the 40 bucks to host one for a month no biggie.
All they have said on the stream is one of the teams has audio tech issues.
I am zealously ad-libbing the rest.
Meanwhile in my Titansgrave game which is being streamed live for the internet one of the other players is now wearing a torch on her head.
Not one of the characters.
One of the players.
A torch with like duracell batteries in it?
An electric torch yes.
2055 utc. At long last NaVi vs Dignitas is off XD.
BwaS i think they just beat dota 2 in fucking taking forever to start matches.
Dob bow for marks and gun for BM?
I'm completely misreading this?
Yes that is the way round.
Did it end up being Rokh?
Bet anathema isn't the shadow priest staff either.
BM is this titan gun forged by mimiron MM is like Alleria's bow.
SV get a moose tauren spear.
Professions are important! We made NPCs!
For a moment I was worried I would have nothing to watch over dinner.
But then I remembered I still hadnt seen the second little witch academia.
Holina PvP dev under interview. Host asks him about pet battles.
Its a kind of pvp!
MoonWolf they really -really- want me to tavern brawl.
I got the 5 wins quest 2 times this week.
Oh ffs the 'downvote shit qs in our qa crowdsource' seemed to have failed.
They asked the bloody dance studio classic realms guild housing bollocks. Yay for time wasting.
Did you guys see fucking Jay Wilson at the QA panel.
Had it on in the background.
Was he the one drowning in his own sass?
He had a beard like.
I didn't really watch any of today going to VoD it.
Remember how we said he'd let himself go after D3.
He seems to have.
Anyone wanna mumble? need to test my new mic.
If mairbear can dungeons.
Murdering one but will join after.
Best costume ever.
A costume to surpass metal gear?
This is magnificently british.
Possibly but that air crash they mention was pretty horrific.
But then again it was that planes last flight.
Gold on RPS today Have You Played... Neptune's Pride?
If you have you probably only played it once.
Once and a half maybe.
I have been listening to a recording of Ben Brode for 10 minutes.
There's quite a lot of background noise and then he laughs.
And it's like NO THIS IS THE ONLY THING YOU CAN HEAR NOW.
ChaosSmurf did you ask the thing ?
Turns out although the lodestone shows my character as being on moogle server it is actually on leviathan.
Got my third screen from the folks' =D.
Do you have enough space to put it down now are are you hanging it again ?
I don't know where the base is.
So it's still on an arm.
ChaosSmurf how do you transcribe Ben Brode's laugh anyway?
I feel like laughs just doesn't cut it.
My colleague's girlfriend gave birth this weekend.
And iirc he said it was her birthday this weekend too.
I will have to check with him when he returns to work whether it was the same day.
Oh also Janos finally confirmed the date for that wedding so...
Anathema ^ good time y/n?
Majestic sea flapflap sadel.
Currently spent 11 bonus points on backgrounds D.
Anathema you do realize you are stuck on an island yes ?
Your face is stuck on a islan.
Man the sound output on my television is awful.
Ffs 3 players down on DH again this week.
Only 1 show then ?
Noelor if you say so.
Those are some massive sciscors.
Back at my parents' I'd disconnect a couple times every day.
I've just checked my notices tab and have disconnected once so far this month.
I am Grace's face in the first panel of today's EGSNP.
Hrm 55 mins till no FF for 24 hours... but cba to really do things.
And yet I'll be wanting to do all the things in an hour or two.
24 hours to deploy a patch ?
MairBear i spent some time yesterday doing the most important part of playing a game with dyes and transmogs. some good old fashion.
MoonWolf generic agro zoolock.
Suddenly rag on turn 8.
Didn't see that coming!
MoonWolf this paladin is making me sad.
Why is that ?
Both humilities played and a peacekeeper by turn 6.
And he put blessing of wisdom.
He lost though... because savage roar.
The corpses equals flowers thing continues in this agme.
Nobody really cared also i forgot your name.
Even gets a seperate flower corpse in your inventory.
Ftrbzzs gonna need more practice with the espresso machine I think.
Well thank fuck we didn't do our release on Friday.
Found a terrible bug ?
Get in today dev from another team says to me btw the entire front end is broken paraphrased.
Missing brace in a function I last edited but thank fuck it isn't my problem looks like a merge resolution 20 commits later just undid my fix but not completely.
Miss 1 brace no warnings froma compiler.
Well there was compiler errors hooray typescript but they don't stop the build from completing because we have a weird setup.
Fixing it is on our TODO but it might not be possible.
Since we embed our JS in our assemblies as resources.
You are the worst.
Deleting the branch you are on makes it behave weirdly and think every file in the repository is new.
I fixed the bug though wasn't my fault \o/.
Why would you ever delete your current branch.
In fact can you even do that.
Well I wanted to rename it to be lower case but it already existed so I deleted it.
Except it still thought I was on that branch.
So because it didn't exist every file was new.
Fucking terrifying read comments.
Anathema the irony of those things is that they are utter overkill in an real situation.
That's what makes them terrifying.
Okay so there is a point where you reach maximum destructive power that missile has clearly reached it.
MORE doesn't do anything.
The world is already doomed to nuclear hellfire.
Double the nuclear hellfire doesn't accomplish shit.
MoonWolf you read ?
How the fuck did that happen.
How to you accidentally append missile launch order to weather information.
Shots has been fired for the past couple of months now p.
Outside of the games journalism bubble?
I take it you missed the whole Derek Smart kerfluffle.
Or I assume the article is about that.
The article mentions it.
Haha there's a convention.
So they must be burning about half a million at least in salaries each month.
I take it you missed the whole Derek Smart kerfluffle <- the levels of irony and fucking hyprocresy are still off the charts.
Did someone say derek smart derek smart DEREK SMART.
Desktop commander is still the best thing to come out of SA.
Derek battle cruiser Smart.
Oh ff14 is down until tomorrow <.
Patches take forever in japan ?
Other UK tweeters demanded to know what Americans bought from chain bakery Greggs - only to discover Greggs also does not exist in the US.
This article is pretty anglocentric.
Non english speaking countries have sausage rolls too.
Tree of savior seems fun if really casual WHEN IT LETS YOU INTO THE GAME.
It can't be casual.
Its made by ragnarok people.
What has the world come too.
Unless the bosses get a lot more agressive later on its too easy.
Or the mobs just start doing a whole lot of damage.
Okay I give up not going to play this thing today. Just not letting me log in.
Man I'm bored NOW but RE4 would take like HOURS To download #1stworldproblems.
<= thats it comic over we've just summed up gunnerkrigg.
So noelor lily is finally happy again in poppy. On scale from 1 to crying cats how depressing do you think the story will become now.
Not everything has to be relentlessly sad GlennCuttlefish.
Look webcomic artists sustain themselves on tears of their fans.
>the world is awful.
I see fallout 4 reviews are out. And /v/ will be even more unreadable than usual for the next month.
I have not been to v in months.
Life is so much better now.
Problem with /v/ is that you need a better mental filter than for most of 4chan.
You need to mentally filter THE WHOLE PLACE.
So may as well not visit.
Thats all of 4chan.
Glenn /v/ is always insufferable. So is /vg/ but I only go there for pictures anyway so.
Dont get why they cheat with making the last 5 images not cosplay related /.
What vague sort of thing are you pinging my phone for CA?
I'm going to say that's not critical enough for me to check from work =P.
I thought you need a little pep.
Being jealous of American cosplayers' legs may not help however.
Wait Outsider updated AGAIN?! Surely this is the end times.
Back to a decade of no updates.
We just got all of them.
My psychic debugging skills are improving.
I really like debugging.
Gemblades are basically like gunblades from Final Fantasy 8 except the design is much more sensible because they are just normal weapons that happen to have a gun mechanism build into their crossguard instead of being oversized pistols with a blade for a barrel.
Well it kind of is.
Still makes for a terrible firearm however.
Although in this case its not for shooting purposes You squeeze down the trigger and one or more of the soulgems inside the magazine will get pulverized releasing its energy to temporarily turn the weapon into a vibro-blade with improved density and cutting power.
Nono thats malfean stealth.
To be fair the thread I saw that in was discussing bard music and stealth.
MairBear you may actually be the only person without a character sheet for ex3 btw also check topic.
I see a Heritihia which I guess denotes my hubris from this morning.
Universe couldn't let the bragging stand.
MairBear i'm missing out on valuable duty finder bonus XP MairBear.
I'm doing an employee engagement survey.
Plus points asks gender then later asks whether or not that matches your assignment at birth.
Minus only two buttons for gender later pages have 1-7 ratings where which end is good is inconsistent.
Double negative points its a survey.
I kinda like surveys >.>.
It's my inner statistician I expect.
I will live and accept that you like surveys.
But i will be here.
There was a link at the end of the survey for feedback about this survey.
So I sent them a short email >.>.
They *asked* for feedback.
And I had complaints.
Were you disappointed that the feedback form for the survey wasn't an additional survey.
The internal name for the 'assay exchange' tab on the software another team makes is 'assexch'.
I lol'd because I'm 12 years old internally.
The summary of my feedback was it's great that you're acknowledging trans* identities but you still have this room for improvement on that.
Also its a survey.
And they are bad.
Also also some of your ratings are ambigious i guess.
So our SR Africa GM just posted this in skype as a file a former acquiantance to the team sent one of the members alongside a job offer.
Someone didn't edit that title right.
And or gordon is a woman now.
Yeah the title that PatternSpider grabbed doesnt really match up with the url and the actual article headline.
Thats the title the page has in the tag.
Also I asume they're doing what Batman Beyond did and have Barbara be the commissioner.
Reading it doens't really solve the confusion though.
Mariah Carey will voice Commissioner Gordon for The LEGO Batman Movie.
Its more the header picture that makes it confusing.
Like if they made gordon a woman fine whatever.
But thats not really the implication here.
And its just weird.
Also no mention that it'll be Barbara Gordon aka Batgirl that will be commissioner.
Or that's what I assume will be the case.
If you read the lineup its Rosario Dawson as batgirl.
So that doens't fit.
So I guess they're genderbending him. vOv.
That male Zarya is fucking fantastic.
Wish I'd found him on the show floor.
What name is noelor under.
Is he not here.
What have I forgotten to DL.
Gotham/Limitless/Supergirl/The Flash/Arrow/The Walking Dead.
Agents of Shield correct.
What is being Jesus Christed?
So much shit to download.
That you have another character name.
Is Nina off the rotation yet.
So noelor lily is finally happy again in poppy. On scale from 1 to crying cats how depressing do you think the story will become now <- doublecat.
Ok so the first thing is that MoonWolf killed Ember.
And the second thing I'm not sure.
It was an accident!
Yes Nina is not in my nicklist.
It was more like manslaughter than murder.
Also on facebook it's a friend's friend's birthday so he my friend is Liking all the other people wishing her his friend a happy birthday.
Which was a bit annoying.
Then I scroll down far enough and one of them says happy third birthday.
Also a friend of a different friend has her banner image set to a scan of the foetus currently inside her.
Which I find weird but maybe that's just me.
Those shells would never work for those barrels.
And that bothers me.
The article - perhaps incorrectly - explained to US readers that sausage rolls are a British favourite on Boxing Day. wait what?
Who the fuck thinks that's incorrect.
Sausage rolls are not a favourite on boxing day ?
They're a favourite on every day.
That's what they're saying.
And I'm furiously disagreeing.
I mean ok yes ftrbzzs is also right.
Boxing day is xmas lunch leftovers supplemented by sausage rolls.
That's just how it works.
I think that counts as a favourite.
ChaosSmurf did you see this female Deathwing though?
Noelor sadly not in person.
But yes I saw boob Dragon.
Okay that does not look comfy as a costume.
Cooked_Auto quite a few of these were in the contest too.
That handsome jack is amazing.
But i can't help but wonder how much is costume and how much is photoshop.
MoonWolf it's not even the least-comfortable-looking boobplate in this album.
Caveat that what you put your body in is your own business.
Also this draenei.
If they'd had medieval soldiers who looked like Jessica Nigri.
Still look dumb and like its not worth the discomfort just to have boobs look that way.
Boob plat probably would have been real.
Those hooves are some serious dedication to the... artform?
Have you seen the mecha Anubarak.
Noelor those are just stilts pretty much not hard to do.
Noelor they are verisimilitude.
I would guess she was on those bouncy things.
Cooked_Auto the difference with stilts is that unless I'm very much mistaken you're not then on tiptoes on top of them.
That circus performers and lots of cosplayers use.
It looks like her actual ankles are in those purple socks and definitely did when she was walking.
Noelor Actually she's not on tiptoes on them as they work something like this.
But maybe I'm wrong.
Given the heat in that convention center.
Did you see the one in the christmas outfit?
The amount of HotS cosplay was pretty real too tbh.
Any pink wrath barbarians ?
It was like WoW > HotS >>> Overwatch > StarCraft > Diablo contest-wise.
Is it worth watching the cosplay bit.
I got sent a code for VT.
Need to watch all the WoW stuff at some point.
In fact how were the contests overall.
Did Will make it unbarable.
Trying to remember the names of new cards in League of Explorers.
Noelor dunno how much of this you already knwo but it just popped up on twitter.
I haven't watched the relevant panel yet.
Looks like they're doing 3 a day.
And literally just saw that the articles were coming out and mage wasn't out *yet* when I got home.
ChaosSmurf I found wilw and the contests alright.
I might put them on when I go to bed.
Yeah that's probably fair.
ChaosSmurf did you click on btw.
That image is taking forever to load.
Yeah I forgot to ping you on it because I was busy being mad at the rest of facebook.
You know what you could do with images like that if we were on a program made in this millenium.
Not have to upload to Dbox.
ChaosSmurf is so angry about irc.
There's a glorious future out there.
It's full of ads though ChaosSmurf.
A glorious future full of chat server so robust they'll still let me chat while my dns is broken and i drop 50% of my pacets.
What world is this.
A world where everything is terrible.
Time to go ruin it with datamining.
Man nobody gives a flying fuck about this gamea ny mroe.
Kinda nice I haven't had to completely disconnect from the internet to dodge spoilers though.
P. hype for tomorrow.
Fallout 4 is coming out!
I still havent been able to get hyped for that.
I don't care much either.
Bethesda have never made a good game.
But some people do.
ChaosSmurf except ofcourse all those people who disagree with you.
My prediction is that it will be a solid 7.5-8.5 game.
I missed the Tavern Brawl.
No coop for you.
I'm mad as hell.
It wasn't very fun without being able to talk to your opponent.
Man the RE4 save point music is so comfy.
Yeah I had a dude I was gonna do it with.
What world is this <- should have said Catvalry's here.
Bah. Should have gone shopping today.
I have no interesting groceries now.
There is now an open bottle of cider in my fridge.
Because I opened it before realising how room temperature it was.
And a slightly drunker person in your seat ?
This chapter contains scenes of violence death social abuse drug-induced coercion psychological torment and references to and displays of acute mental illness including disassociation and suicidal ideation and graphic monstrouous/horror imagery.
WELP this chapter of solistice war is about to get Real again.
I saw a goodfellas 'dessert pizza' in tesco today.
Gimme some o' that coil?
If by that you mean lets put defector aliens in your squads.
Oh there's a plz there.
Sorry if i was confusing.
Anyone here vaguely good at photoshop?
Found a bag of pesto so I put it in my pasta.
Found a bag of pesto so I put it in my pasta.
Thanks for repeating that i guess ?
Well I couldn't make the proper addendum without copy paste.
It was poetry MoonWolf.
I'm sorry i don't think i've ever been with it.
Just dealt 10 lethal damage with a single crossbow bolt because Essence 4 exalts are ridiculous.
ChaosSmurf did actually going to Blizzcon grant you a digital pass for the VoDs?
Please provide detailed illustrations.
As many as possible.
ChaosSmurf I hope your body is ready.
Man I've become a wuss.
Cant even handle RE4 alone now.
Buddy up with ChaosSmurf.
The best LP tbh.
Noelor is that exalted 3 time final?
It's not going to get any later.
I wasn't expecting it to be later than that from last time we talked.
However I still would like to make a less plot important character that can drop in at a short notice?
Still the night was not a complete loss. The school paper reported that â€œin true Manc fashion the guilty house were sic seen handing out beers as an apology.â€.
MoonWolf so shadow priests use Insanity as their resource because shadow magic is the domain of the old gods and they tap directly into it.
And also a retcon.
And i hate it.
And a discipline priest is now narratively one who treads the line between Light and Void.
And has the discipline to... not get carried away with either?
When you deal spell damage you instantly heal all targets affected by Atonement for 50% of the damage done.
Wait how do mortal martial arts even work now.
GlennCuttlefish as a mortal it's just an alternative brawl skill.
I am not sure I like this thematically.
It's a bunch of alternative brawl skills technically.
Each martial art is its own ability rated 1-5.
Which then has its own set of charms if you're exalted.
So if I max out martial arts now I just become some sort of super sifu the moment I exalt?
And per the book each MA skill you want to start buying into requires you to repurchase the merit.
Noelor i liked it better when shadow was just the consequenc of light. just sort of existed becuase light existed.
I mean the naaru light / shadow elementals were also dumb.
Well you still need to spend bp/xp/starting charms on MA charms.
But not nearly as dumb as actually its just old gods.
Lets not evne get into how old gods tie into naaru.
MoonWolf there's still a bit there about brightest light casting deepest shadows bla bla.
But to master shadow magic is to step on the realm of the old gods.
Why does the martial artist merit even require brawl.
This is all in.
GlennCuttlefish oh no idea.
Raise your hand if you were playing shadowpriest to be insane.
Mind if I ignore that?
Oka ynow raise your hand if you wanted to play it because face melting and lifedrains.
Tbh as a mortal just ignore the merit.
Because hatewheel's specifically said that it's there as a balancing point for exalted who take multiple MAs.
Hurl a harpoon at your target and pull yourself toward them rooting them in place for 3 sec. the return to Survival-as-melee is real.
Marksmanship mastery now increases attack range o.0.
It has done all warlords.
The scaling of it isn't actually that huge and when the attuned stat is crit it's not a bonus that comes into effect much.
The archi trinket in hfc for mm is % extra dmg for dist to target so links with that.
But other trinks at the same tier beat it in MM.
Can't wait to see how they ruin rogues p.
BM/SV it might only be 2nd at best as there's this glorious one.
So yeah when you have fights where you want to be in range of the healer or stacking the MM archi trink is a dud.
Summon Refreshment now automatically provides you with a stack of food if you’re adventuring out on your own or a table of refreshments when in a party or raid. it's like I don't even know WoW any more.
Displacement For the next 4 sec casting Blink will not trigger its cooldown whut.
Apparently Arcane is now the Blink frenzy spec?
They should do Casting Blink will automatically trigger a Frost Nova at your arrival location at no extra GCD.
Wouldn't you want it at your starting point though?
Engulf yourself in flames increasing your critical strike chance by 100% for 10 sec sure that checks out.
We started to wonder how a spell supposedly combining frost and fire wasn’t just producing a puddle of water at the feet of the enemy Blizz stop thinking so hard.
And miss half the fun?
Well was just thinking back to the days when mages would blink to hunter melee range nova retreat to deadzone sweet spot and ice lance.
Noelor is there a specific place you want character sheets to go?
Anathema nah just host it somewhere and put a link in the gdoc please.
I almost forgot to buy a valet retainer.
We're doing a martial competition.
Yes so I need someone to saddle my horse and help my put on my armour.
MoonWolf he's a dynast.
A highly impractical dynast.
Hey I dropped Command 2 a Size 3 unit so over 100 soldiers.
Don't bring an army this god is about personal might.
If the campaign were to lead into a longer one armies may come up.
MairBear you're still planning to be Kudrani right?
Relevant to last nights discussion regarding Blizzards view on priest specs.
What annoys me the most is that the uniform is most likely a US Army jacket from WW2.
Went to the gym before work today soooo hungry.
In case anyone ever forgets that intel are butts.
We make professional high-quality software.
MairBear if Kudrani is still a scythe fighter fyi there is a scythe-based martial art called White Reaper.
And I'm removing the requirement for you to take a merit before learning MAs.
Well strictly speaking before learning *an* MA.
It would be weird to take multiple as a starting character though imo.
Although mortals still can't use supernatural MAs IIRC?
Mortals can learn martial arts.
They cannot learn martial arts charms.
.'. MA as a mortal is mechanically identical to brawl.
Other than I guess allowing use of the form weapon and its tags.
But even on Righteous Devil that's not worth a 4-dot merit.
With Brawl 1 as a prereq.
I got a ham and cheese toastie from Greggs.
Their formula is thus bread ham cheese bread cheese cheese.
I always through the bread was to ontain the delicious but sticky and greasy cheese.
I wonder if that comma's there just to confuse you or is that supposed to be read in some weird order.
Sweep love! The cavalry's here!
It makes me think of the South Park song let's fighting love... But... the other brooms also speak backwards and aren't just in jokes.
I've always wondered.
I would like a song that is just 8 minutes of the vocals from the middle of Smack My Bitch Up.
On you go then.
Well like not literally just the middle of SMBU repeated for 8 minutes.
Do you guys wanna do a dungeon in FFXIV tonight? it does downleveling yeah?
Sure and it does.
Oh what they added ninjas since I last played.
<- leveling as a lancer.
I'm waering a bikini and s skirt.
At least i have greaves ?
The skirt has a very high waistline for fantasy art.
Its still just a frilly skirt.
Not exactly front line fighting with my lancer equipment.
All the badass plate armour is highlevel stuff.
Its actually warmer than I thought.
<- oh hey i can now fight things again.
MoonWolf click the url in the accepted answer.
Domain is parked ?
I see what you did.
Not to be confused with darknest necromancy.
K6BD continues to be brilliant.
Progress of light level so far in Newcastle this morning.
Dark before sunrise -> sunrise light level increases -> sun immediately goes behind clouds dark again.
People in here literally yelling crap at each other.
Heated arguments about the work pub quiz last night.
You sure work with a group of mature adults.
GlennCuddlefish MairBear. I found one. A thaumaturge that had no clue how to do his job. at all.
I might be exaggerating due to how annoying I find it.
It was someone who just hated getting astral fire.
Spent a significant amount never casting at all.
Noelor mostly done with character sheet bonus points yet to spend a few things yet to read to understand.
Was casting physic a few time even though nobody was super low and i was healing just fine.
And then afk'd out of the dungeon on after the second boss.
I thought you were going sorcery D.
Also I had to google how to spell 'exaggerate'.
Did you unlock next dungeon yet moonwolf?
Should we run the dungeon then? Talking to you too mairbear.
Can we wait untill after lunch.
Bout an hour from now ?
I've unlocked Stone Vigil and Darkhold.
Too low level for dakrhold atm though.
We can do Hauke Manor tonight if I get another level?
Tonight is 13th age.
Of the scrolls kind.
Rinko Kikuchi was the only actor who was not physically exhausted from the intense filming in the Jaeger cockpit. When del Toro asked for her secret she replied â€œI think of gummi bears and flowers.â€.
I can catch up some then.
Since I will need something nice to do after dealing with datetime issues today.
MoonWolf I don't understand.
It hadn't evne loaded yet.
Why is dropbox so slow to load shit.
Ok no I'm still confused.
I considered pasting you the code to run but obv you'd get different answers since you live in a stupid timezone.
Okay i've looked at it.
Google a ef wthings to make sure i understood.
Ð¢Ñ€Ð°ÐºÑ‚Ð¾Ñ€Ð¸ÌÐ½Ð° -Tractorina. F Tractor.
Best i have that comparisons to offsets are a bit weird in a way i don't know about.
But i've never used offsets before.
Mobile views beware warning applies.
They shouldn't be comparisons between offsets and datetimes should convert the datetime to an offused using the .Kind of the time.
Is... that a woodlouse?
Anathema a more direct example. same baffeling result.
I'm sure there is some explenation for it.
But i have no clue what it is.
Is it gonna be as heart breaking as FFXIV sheep?
I've not heard sounds yet.
They also added a ton of mirror match emotes.
So now you don't just exchange idintical greetings anymore.
And in D3 news.
They really nerfed bonus xp into the ground.
3 pieces 5% down from 50% bonus experience at level 70.
Order of magnatude nerf.
2 pieces Speed as a chicken is increased by an additional 400% up from 200%.
Chicken is EVEN SLOWER.
Anathema its still 50% while leveling just no longer at max level.
Because blizzard got sick of high level groups being 3 zdps and 1 person actually clearing.
I assume he means zero dps or something.
Zdps builds or zero dps builds are character builds that are almost completly support oriented.
And then they would put as much +xp gear on them as possible.
Because xp bonus was party shared.
So you'd have a group of 3 people supporting on person to kill things.
So they'd all get massive xp boosts.
Maybe they should stop writing such exploitable systems |.
But was 1 really unfair for solo players.
And 2 not exactly the idea they were going for when they made bonus xp group shared.
Anathema before it was shared people complained that someone would bring a zdps build and then skyrocket their own xp but everyone else go no benefit.
So sharing happened last patch.
And that just led to the current state.
So now bonus xp is getting destroyed and instead base xp for solo players is getting improved.
Zdps builds will still have value for low gear players or just because support is still good in general.
But no more utterly stupid mostly zdps parties.
GlennCuddlefish MairBear instances ?
Yay curse auras ?
Naturally you generally want to change the result if it appears a bit weird like if the group meets a nice princess and one PC suddenly has his danger sense on overdrive which is one of the examples presented in the book. Seems like a sensible reaction to me. She could be evil!
MoonWolf look how weird their arms are.
The necks are weirder.
ChaosSmurf 2016 holiday bookings opened up today.
After a quick trip to imdb got the last Friday *and Thursday* of April off.
I'm watching the mechanics panel from Blizzcon.
They appear to have just thrown out the entire Priest class except Holy.
And made two new ones instead.
Discipline now heals mainly from damage.
And Shadow has an insanity meter and uses old gods powers.
Also shared mining/herbalism nodes thank you jesus.
ChaosSmurf they've gone backwards and forwards on disc using damage to heal like 3 times now.
They seem to be going all in on it this time.
Based on that speech anyway.
Are they making punch priests heal with damage again too ?
And by punch priest i mean monk.
I dunno does anyone know anything about monks.
In practice HAH no.
ChaosSmurf> Discipline now heals mainly from damage <---- After the shit they did to monks.
Hahahaha the unique crafting material is called obliterum.
I'm gonna pissed if they don't give fistweaving back.
That you use in the obliterum forge.
Have they posted the Monk class thing yet.
Warrior has gone up but I need to finish this panel before watching it.
Here have a heal by damage stance it's really cool.
Oh no our bad it was OP its now useless this expansion.
Oh hey guys how about a healer that heals by damage?
SOUNDS GREAT! Give it to priest.
ChaosSmurf based on the article all three kinds of priest are way different.
Yeah I don't know how they expect to balance damage + healing on one class.
Because either the healing has to be bad so the class is useless.
Or the damage has to be bad in which case what's the point really.
Tbh they have the league of legends problem.
Where they have these roles so there isn't as many interesting things they can do.
Oh they removed glyphs.
I dont know if there was a class that worked like melee DPS aka punching things that did decent healing but not that much damage I might pick up a healing class.
Like I want to punch things and healing to fly out like handouts at oprah.
Sounds good to me.
No more need to get mandatory glyph x thats the best.
Oh it sounds alright for game design.
I think ChaosSmurf means bad for the scribes.
And for me not an inscriptor.
But they added runes that increase your damage against certain bosses and last a week.
Which just sounds garbage.
MoonWolf did I talk about bratwurst last week?
You takled about sausage at the office.
Did not talk about that.
The cafe here does bratwurst on Wednesdays.
And if you ask for one they offer you curry sauce to go with it.
I assume we mean the spiced ketchup kind of curry.
Might get into secondary profs finally this expac.
Not the eastern spice mixture.
And when I asked for fried onions instead last week.
The lady at the counter looked at me like some sort of wizard.
What ever ARE ONIONS.
Am I alone in considering fried onions the Correct condiment for wurst?
Also if I had curry ketchup it'd be currywurst.
They made world drops legendary.
ChaosSmurf also something about bandages.
They're going to need a new rarity.
Minister that was great.
The new rarity is artifact tbh.
Minister personally i'd go for curry and mayo and finely chopped non fried onions.
The cheers for transmog.
The D3 system is the superior system.
Glad they stole it.
Also for anyone who's curious Janos is currently Anathemaing his ex3 character.
So... changing it repeatedly ?
He had a Sijanese guardsman built.
Then find out Anathema was also going to use swords so... went back to the drawing board.
And it's currently on a Haltan diplomat / spider trainer.
Okay from now on Anathema and Janos are only allowed to make characters in a vacuum.
Otherwise they'll feed off of eachother.
Must be something about wegies.
Hahahahaha the cheers for transmog.
It was like 5 minutes of everyone going mental.
ChaosSmurf why didn't you tell me you finished writing your HS interviwe thing.
Had to find out about it from twitter.
We get rage from taking damage again.
I'm sure that will be balanced this time.
They fixed rage again.
They made it so you can't get in revenge loops.
Where you're just pressing revenge until it stops proccing.
They also made it hit every target in front of you.
But i liked those loops.
Doing so much revenge damage.
Deep wounds isn't on thunder clap any more.
Time to change class.
So i had an idea for coop HS games.
They should make a slightly different board.
Only there is a middle section now.
Where the opponent lives.
And you can only target the middle section.
And ofcourse the opponent has hero targeting rules.
So you can't set their attack/hp number of shadowword them.
They said they tried that and it didn't work.
It was just ugly in the UI apparently.
It'd be better than the moving around onthe board.
Okay it sounds like they removed everything I liked about playing a prot warrior in warlords.
Hard to tell without talents.
But rage gain is tiny from abilities now.
They gave us a 90% shield wall to replace shield block.
That only lasts for x damage based on max health.
But sounds like a catchall button instead of shield block/shield barrier's choices.
No deep wounds on thunderclap is a huge nerf unless it already wasn't there and I didn't notice.
Hopefully it is a talent.
Also kinda disappointed we didn't get bigger changes like everyone else.
Have they published what they are doing to druids yet ?
Yeah it was first I think.
Want to see what they are doing with resto.
So the men don't fall over.
Are you gonna heal me again this go round.
Challenge dungeons sound like everything I would have wanted last year.
I'm healing other people in FFIVX now.
You've got six months to get bored of that.
How are they taking this long for another expansion.
I actually asked that.
Got a bit of a nothing answer iirc.
It's the one that hasn't been transcribed yet tho so I can't check.
Becaues they only awnser they have is we said we wouldn't again. and we did it again.
Its like your mate thats always an hour late to raids.
He always says he'll be on time next time.
He basically said we hate it too but such is life lol.
And also we can either do it this way have a long beta and make something good or we can release trash like every other company.
Yeah but warlords ran out of raiding content faster than your previous expansion blizzard.
You are strangeling your playerbase on things to actually do in your mmo.
This is a clear issue.
WoD had the same as everything else.
Few world bosses etc.
And ran out about as fast as MoP did.
It only had two big patches but that's because they just sort of put Blackrock in.
So nice the boardgame cafe lets you paint warhammer now if you bring your own stuff.
Suddenly a steam sale.
Why is Tataru a dancer in a seedy inn now?
!note Noelor did Herithia have a 1 or 2 handed sword ?
MairBear thats tataru for you. I mean where did she get the courage to do that is my question I guess her storyline has been going in that direction.
Stolen from Facebook because it won't let me link to it Brussel sprouts are a lot like pubic hair you push them aside before eating.
Minister some people are into that kind of thing.
I thought that was about to get into some EU comment.
I'm not looking up smiley codes on my phone you know which one I mean.
Minister those 5bux would fly into blizzards account.
They might do basic palette swaps the same way as HotS idk.
ChaosSmurf seriously though not asking the SC2 guys about the acronym.
Minister Clearly you mean 10bux.
MoonWolf technically she has a magic wand.
That is so heavy and sharp as to be used as a sword.
Would you prefer a future wand/sword to be one or two handed ?
Because if I get an epic weapon I'm taking the epic weapon feat occultists get.
Noelor I know.
That lets those weapons count as staves.
MairBear the monk preview is up.
One-handed swords do 1d4 for occultist.
Pretend I said L the first time.
That just means that today you don't find a sword.
There are Lore Reasons.
That just means I don't have to take that feat yet.
And can instead take feats that make me a better occultist.
I swear Roll20's cookies are expiring even more quickly these days.
Noelor how do you feel about head slot items ?
I think they sound pretty cool.
And on-theme for Herithia.
And I'm certainly not going to complain about +3MD.
That works for me.
Hmm fireworks gone off again nearby. Not sure if they're incredibly late or I'm just racist cos maybe it's diwali or summat?
It 100% is in fact diwali.
Tbh I didn't even know that was close enough to guess at it.
Also it's not racist to not know the date of a holiday you don't celebrate.
A pizza place a few minutes' walk from me offers the following toppings.
I'm 100% onboard with kebab.
I'm going to get changed then order a pizza then go get it then come back to eat it then game probably.
MAYBE I'M A LION.
I'm very confused at this point in time.
The backup Rules of Nature tbh.
MoonWolf I am gonna do a thing.
Have you watched last week's Flash.
MairBear what thing ?
You might need to add difficulty to the fight.
Should i be worried ?
Because of the thing I might do.
*Is the best cleric*.
What are you guys playing anyway.
I see we're all trying to confuse one another today.
13th age in elderscrolls universe.
ChaosSmurf last anything I watched was Flash of Two Worlds.
Alos this track seems to be missing the Maybe I'm A Lion line.
I only have the Black Mages version.
They won the last one didn't they.
MairBear they didn't give you punchyhealing back did they.
Just need to wipe the paint off my face then I'll be on mumble.
Spot the problem here.
Identified everything in that picture correctly.
Well the Overwatch account tweeted my preview.
234 active readers and rising.
ChaosSmurf>> can I just say I love how the background image to your site plugs Project Titan.
Are you saying this just to annoy me by saying project titan.
MoonWolf PTR notes are up for D3 2.4.
Oooo new bit of Leoric's Manor.
It was in their one presentatino.
That's low on my to-watch list.
And the fact I keep falling asleep half way through them isn't helping.
What do I wanna play next season.
Omg they've made a Thorns Crusader build.
I am 100% playing Thorns Crusader.
I got no conquests done.
I was the dead weight.
Don't do it to yourself.
I don't think I finished the last part of the season journey on my WD.
Despite being like T7 solo.
I didn't finish gold despite being t10 solo.
Adds 30000 Thorns damage.
Thorns damage increased by 1500 per rank.
At rank 25 your Primary skills Taunt the first enemy hit or 2 seconds.
Might just play DH tho.
ChaosSmurf they keep trying.
It keeps being awfu.
An arrow will now indicate the location of the Keywarden if you are in a zone where one is present.
Oh my god these QoL changes.
They nerfed conduit pylon.
Packs with the Frozen affix now have an increased delay between their Frozen casts.
Greatly increased the cooldown of their teleport.
THANK YOU BASED DIABLO GODS.
Health orbs now look even less like molten?
I think they're keeping that one just for us.
Mage got a new tooltip icon?
New item comparison tooltips have been added for followers PLS.
Cosmetic pets now pick up gold for you <- oh hey they brought that back.
From way back in beta.
Ferrets did that c.
Also new inkeeper message o.o.
Back from my adventures.
And by adventures i mean one haukke manor run and then quit because emergency maintenance.
Its what the innkeeper said when i logged in.
MairBear if you finished your character could you please put a link into the gdoc?
Demonology warlocks are getting a spell in Legion that Calls down a demonic meteor full of Wild Imps.
<- well thats a ui.
If you say so.
MairBear what issues? at work obv.
I did the first FFXI crossover FATE this morning then went to the gym hooray for waking up at 430.
Don't wake up at 430.
Thats a bad time to wake up.
OTOH I got a new shower gel for the gym and now I smell of delicious coconut.
I hope somewhere in FFXIV there is an NPC ninja called 'Bludd' wearing robes and a pointy hat.
Noelor MoonWolf told me that Dodge Extra Dice Pls is a valid specialty.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish.
!note Noelor stupid question what happens if you assign your Wood Dragons Claws the Thrown tag ?
I'd assume you can't >_>.
But i wanted to turn my arm into a crossbow Anathema.
I think that would be a different spell.
Turn it into the a dragon mouth that shoots fire at people.
Well i am taking Fire Dragons Claws so i could do that.
But on the other hand i don't have proper essence so i don 't get to assign tags yet.
Well I still also mean as a seperate spell the intent behind WDC is pretty clearly melee imo.
But the system still just lets me.
I don't need to.
I already have a ranged attack.
But as far as i can tell.
This is just a thing you can do.
.Contains on a list of strings for things which should be case insensitive.
Milestone I just created our 1000th issue.
Definitly need to clear that for the next release.
Haha my boss loudly exclaimed dammit.
He put in 999 then got 1001.
Anathema I need to intimacy at you.
Bow chicka bow wow.
Does Kudrani fight for money?
Pity no Jamie Lannister / Bronn shenanigans then.
Anathema do you solve problems with violence.
If diplomacy fails yes.
I will reserve my second party intimacy for Dob.
MairBear diplomacy usually being surrender or face the consequences because Realm Legions.
Anathema hey sometimes diplomacy is actually political fuckery.
What else does Karuyo value?
Or oops somehow the local ruler was found dead in his bed this morning.
However could that have happened.
Nice insert family member you have there.
Would be a shame if anything bad were to happen to them.
In the palace we are keeping them.
MairBear self-reliance ie he was mad less skilled / experienced automatically outranked him due to being from better families and being Exalted being true to oneself duty honour his horse the realm.
Anathema fair to say that he doesn't care Kudrani is Kurdrani because he's also Kudrani?
A bit weird because he can fight well*.
That would be a fair thing to say indeed.
As long he hasn't seen Kudrani like buy something from someone and then rob them to get his money back or w/e.
In the Realm we call that 'a dick move'.
Weird we call it that in the east as well.
!note Noelor I have rounded out my character just needs a minor tweak or two depending on feedback from you or others.
MoonWolf I'm still at your manipulation str I can get behind.
Yeah well deal with it.
I'll have to since its not my game p.
You can bring the manipulation if it bother syou.
Are you trying to insinuate that Karuyo slept his way through the ranks!?
Fucking visual studio learn to find references in both C# and F# at the same time |.
You guys wanna run haukke manor around 1730-6ish?
Sure i gues.
I might still be eating is the thing.
Unless something sudden happens I should be able to.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish.
MairBear MoonWolf roughly where are your characters from geographically?
Both of use are from the east somewhere on the fringe of more civilized and jungly bits.
Anathema what is your character's name again? Ragara something?
Someone should be Linowan.
Minister Ragara Karuyo although I might change it to Kuroyo or something else.
Or even adding a minor house name in there!
These jammy dodger ripoffs don't have any creamy filling.
On account of Jammy Dodgers are filled with jam.
Is it not jam in the centre then creamy filling surrounding it?
That's what I remember.
Jammy dodgers are shit.
That'd be a jammy/creamy dodger.
So far we have three eastern barbarians and me.
Coworker just tried to type 'culture' but I typed 'cthulhu' instead.
I think your coworker might be a fishman.
MoonWolf not to Kuroyo!
MoonWolf should I take it from your phrasing that you were neighbours?
Probably we've not discussed the details.
I hope we can have been some sort of neighbours.
Is Kudrani from a different forest tribe or like a village/town/city?
Anathema what gender is Karuyo?
MoonWolf are/were Tuscatsi's tribe settled in one place or wandering?
MairBear Is Kudrani from a different forest tribe or like a village/town/city?
Civilised enough to have community remote enough to be isolated and a bandit target.
Is Strawmaiden Janest Kudrani's waifu?
I think she's right out on the edge of the Bordermarches.
The person I wanted to get the Videogamer job got the Videogamer job \o/.
No because I didn't want to move to London on 14 grand.
Who was it ?
A woman named Alice Bell who has fabulous hair.
It's 10000% not public information so don't go finding her on twitter and congratulating.
Not that I would expect you to but just in case.
MoonWolf I discovered today our app triggers 'user x logged in' events when the user fails to login.
I managed to accidentally rewatch all of scrubs a few months back.
Also how fabulous are we talking hair-wise?
You regain 10 Energy each time you deal Bleed damage to a poisoned target. Hm. Not bad.
The lack of a clear theme for the Combat Rogue I see Blizzard have never heard of Swashbucklers or duelists because that is what I always associated with Combat Rogues.
Pity it seemlingly took them this long to actually get that.
I thought the theme of combat rogue was hitting them in the face with a sword and a dagger.
Assassins stab people subtlty does ninja stuff.
And combat hits t hem in the face with a sword.
But to me a combat rogue has always been a bit of a Swashbuckler kind of thing that is very upfront and bold.
Not entierly sure this new Outlaw idea is really that though.
And suddenly pistols vOv.
I mean combat rogues fighting like Witch Hunters in WAR would've been neat but right now that is only really a quick ability.
Which rogue spec's cause is righteous?
Combat? Because its clearly not being a sneaky git P.
It's interesting the ele changes.
Community raging that it's barely changing and only getting QoL stuff.
Just to me that QoL stuff looks big and I'm kinda okay with how it works atm.
Balance shift looks kick-ass.
Not sure about the talent that in application could give a feral druid a 10yd melee rang as if I didn't hate them in pvp enough already.
Someone call hmrc cos they're evading the hybrid tax bigtime.
That's why I didn't move.
It was about the same as I'm on now for +5k a year on rent.
Found out the PCG job was paying way more than I expected though should have gone for it.
I mean it's better than exposure but.
Although flip side you've had this job for what the months?
Hmm perks of a grad scheme I'm applying for a 'graduate conference'.
Fine until you realise it's a 'residential wknd' in the lake district.
And I know /precisely/ what that entails.
Lol Lineage 2 is on Steam now.
And its region locked /.
Noelor I've had THIS job for three months.
I've been freelancing for three years.
And learning how to do it for 10.
Freeleeching for even longer.
ChaosSmurf yeah I meant the actual factual job.
Leaving a job after three months strikes me as not a brilliant move?
Idk maybe journos are all that mercenary =P.
MairBear> Noelor MoonWolf told me that Dodge Extra Dice Pls is a valid specialty <- not so much no.
MoonWolf> !note Noelor stupid question what happens if you assign your Wood Dragons Claws the Thrown tag ? <- so a Spider's been dropping notes.
B you tell me what that looks like.
However you sepll that.
Sort of doing a bossfight.
Mumble might be easier.
There will be class-specific quests such as to go and hunt some demons or pick particular pockets... I'll let you guess which classes those are for.
I mean Hunters do hunt and Warlocks... rifle through the pockets of the dead? Or maybe the use demons for pickpocketing.
Noelor after years of class specific quests are a waste of effort.
Legion is a lot about classes.
Because its about YOU and your CHARACTER and his or her STORY.
Our biggest talent review since Mists of Pandaria that's... bigger than WoD then.
We want you to think about fishing itself not whatever's on your second monitor Blizz continue to massively misunderstand the appeal of fishing I.
Dunno that might lure me to fishing if its done well.
I hate the way its done now.
But if they turn fishing into something you'd like.
I someone who likes it now will no longer like it.
And that's not disastrous.
Except not everyone reads patch notes / watches blizzcon / reads mmo-c / whatever.
So it's more likely to lower the number of fishers.
Maybe long term I'm wrong?
Nah I think its fine for most people now.
Noelor maybe if at the same time they make it less of a grindfest.
Because thats fishings problem.
Its an unengaging boring minigame that consumes a lot of TIME.
Maybe they could do fishing as entirely down to pool nodes but the cast completion and loot is guaranteed.
Bring in line with skinning herbalism mining.
Okay just thought about moving it from a sedentary affair of chain 20 sec casts.
The worst treasure.
Anathema it has been brought to my attention that the chargen rules for mortals don't mention specialties either at creation or upon exaltation so add 4 free specialties to Karuyo.
So Necromunda Blood Bowl BFG might be making a return.
That link took longer than I expected to find.
Pretty sure they work as a reseller of other stuff.
A ThinkGeek creation exclusive.
I mean I can believe they made it.
And then sold in bulk to Blizz for Blizzcon because well.
But then it's not exclusive.
All of the class previews are up.
Any o fthem exciting.
Noelor You may need to request access again because drive and me are not working perfectly.
Noelor you go where the money is.
Oh YT changed something again. I see that my browser fullscreen script is broken again.
Noelor>> you're a horrible person linking a pokemon store that only does US shipping.
They're the first google links for those plushes!
I was describing things that are in my flat.
It has finally happened Zelda is now a girl.
MoonWolf could you please send me Tuscatsi's picture in the morning so I can add her to Roll20?
!note MairBear if you have a particular picture in mind for Kudrani please send me it otherwise you're at the mercy of google image.
!note Anathema if you have a particular picture in mind for Karuyo please send me it otherwise you're at the mercy of google image.
A work of art. Art.
Noelor she's in dropbox.
MairBear naxx is out.
Welll the first temple of naxx.
Noelor well I have the old picture I was awful at drawing.
Well played sir toest.
Not going to do herics today.
First wing was trivial with dragonpriest though.
MairBear looks like i'm not allowed to spectate you beating up bosses.
Oh no. i was wrong.
I was idling B.
That collapse just fixed it anyway.
I wonder if you can milldeck this boss.
MoonWolf easy game xD.
I only got 1 bolster in mine.
And that was my last turn.
For the roll20.
If you want to see what I have for you atm Mair.
Thats more cape than i was imagining.
Also is that a RWBY genderbended character ?
Because thinking of scythe-wielding characters with skin was hard.
As opposed to only bones.
I really dig it.
No comment on Ana's though?
I'm just trying to choose between that and this.
A less fabulous pose.
I will get back to you on that Noelor.
Lemme look at Ana.
Ana is just rider.
That... yep. That is just straight up an imperial house member xD.
Anathema how does Karuyo feel about chariots ?
Yeah I prefer the face of the RWBY 63... But Kudrani's dress sense is like a cross between the two x Far more exposed body than the one far more loose cloth than the other.
He has ride and one of his ¿major? intimacies is his horse.
Realm probably does chariots though.
I had forgotten what roll20 is like as a player.
Where did all the options go.
I'm not even Allowed to right click things.
Noelor I have a pictre it needs some minor photoshopping I'll see what I can do myself.
Crap sorry Noelor forgot to reshare the thing before sleep.
Forgot or just couldn't manage ?
Already wet don't need an umbrella anymore.
Time expired 72 mintes average wait time 16 minutes.
Final Fricking Facking Fookin' Frustrating Fruity Fantasy.
Welp guessing I'm getting a Nintendo NX.
Mothe fucking Cloud Strife in Smash Bros? fuck yeah.
Kay lemme start it up.
Might wander off for a few afterwards but can easily do that.
There's a bug with the fallout 4 ENB which released yesterday that permanently tattoos the name/copyright info of the ENB creator asshole on your character's forehead. I almost almost think it was done on purpose because that guy hates human life.
>guy releases amazing tool for free.
People don't hate him for the tool.
They hate him for the massive homofobia islamofobia and general abrasive attitude.
Im pretty sure they hate him because he's a massive asshole p.
People should stop using his tool then.
Well sweetfx and reshader exist now.
The FFX LP thread continues to deliver.
I have no idea of what is going on but I kind of want to try it.
Considering it involves the letters HG for gm so hollyhock god.
Its probably a Chuubo thing.
That is a chuubo thing because it isn't a nobilis 3e thing.
Why do people drink alcohol.
Because they like the taste and like being inebriated?
Noelor first half of this totes canon scythe summoning D.
Woah woah hey now.
Nobody mentioned girl Link would be dual-wielding crossbows.
Yeah its even more impractical!
I suggest that from now on girl link be known as glink.
I'm currently on the bus headed to my parents'.
Which is where I realised this afternoon almost all my notes for tonight's game are!
This is how long ex3 has taken.
Its not that sexy.
MoonWolf is the 4-spec druid thing new to Legion?
Druid has always had 4 sepcs.
Ever since like outland.
Yeah but actually seperating it as a fourth thing to pick.
Rather than it just being two different brands of feral.
Oh yeah that happened in panda.
Yeah ever since the new talent system.
What did they do to resto in the end.
Do you still put the hots on the men.
So the men don't do the death.
I mean some things changed because design stuff.
But really same thing.
That's basically what happened to my entire class.
Yeah I think they're quite fine with resto druid class fantasy of rejuvenate all the things.
Bring back rolling lifeblooms.
I was really hoping for Titan's Grip as a warrior passive.
This is a thing in your head only ChaosSmurf.
Might kinda cheapen the idea of a one-hander.
If you want a one-hander play a fucking Paladin.
Fury dual wields Arms gets unique off-hands Prot gets to actually have something that defines it.
Instead of being we're a tanky tank who tanks tank tank tank tank.
Prot is the sword and board.
Being the best is nice but there's no fantasy there.
All the other tanking classes are 'cooler'.
I dunno in a world where Hunters got a melee spec I was hoping for something cool.
Doesn't good fantasy often need a grounded mortal default option?
Yeah but that doesn't really work if a ninth of your players have to use it.
And it's not like I'm asking for magical whizz-bangs.
I'm just saying make us canonically swole as fuck by letting us do something no-one else can.
On the flipside Shadow Priests sound super fucking fun to play.
Might use my 100 boost on one.
I still haven't used my 90 one.
Kinda hoping it'll get an auto-upgrade.
ChaosSmurf> yeah but that doesn't really work if a ninth of your players have to use it <- prot warrior is 1/36th of the available things you can play in WoW.
I was talking about warriors as a whole.
Which I guess is 1/10th or 1/12th depending on how you look at it.
Though I guess Fury doesn't have the same problem they're quite unique by my perception.
Skipping both hero classes?
I thought it was 10 with Monk.
There's 9 in hearthstone.
Because it's a 3x3 grid.
Then DK monk DH.
That would explain my confusion.
Aight so a 12th.
Or 2 specs out of ... arms plus four for druid plus three by nine plus two for DH.
Druid has 4 DH has 2.
2 of 34 a 17th.
So it's back to an average 3/class in Legion.
Whereas right now it's 3/class +1.
Paladin tanks are Prot Warriors with magic.
Survival hunters are Arms Warriors with a pet.
Ret Paladins are Arms Warriors with magic.
The other tanking classes don't have a big boring shield.
Ok I will take the paladin ones.
Not 100% on the hunter one.
Sure but you see what I mean.
Our identity is we've got this big two hander where as hunters are that plus THIS LITTLE GUY OMG LOOK AT HIM.
They did say something about warrior talents being more active?
Also this is where the artifacts come in I guess.
Oki got my archi normal hfc kill. Considering myself done with WoD now ^^.
I don't know how the arms artifact will beat Ashbringer but w/e.
But I would have liked a nice big change to us like it feels like most other classes got.
Hunters got Survival Rogues got Outlaw Priests got Shadow etc.
MoonWolf and I are not fond of most of the changes.
Mage is bad too.
Yeah mage hasn't changed since BC.
And Monks for some reason didn't get their cool thing back.
Omg the monk thing.
But Priests got it instead!
Priests are cool tbh MoonWolf should not be mad.
We couldn't get fistweaving to work so it's gone You... but... atonement??????????????????
They also took away Glad Stance!!!!!
Which nobody should care about but it fits my narrative so okay!!!!
Demon Locks look really cool as well.
Might just play a Demon Hunter tank tho so w/e.
I wonder if tanking is no longer going to be an auto-queue.
With so many DHs rolling in.
It was laready p. slow waiting for a healer.
And tank DH being super-swole.
M8 have you not seen vengeance demon form?
They'll be just like dk tanks were in wrath *shudder*.
This is the other thing.
Is I don't WANT to change class.
But they're like HERE'S YOUR TEN YEAR FETISH.
FUCK YOUR OTHER CLASS.
DHs hate shirts also.
It's a difficult time.
Also I suppose.
I'm not saying they looked into my head and pulled out a certain character.
But that one doesn't make ChaosSmurf implode.
But I think I'd have a solid copyright case.
I appreciate a large man.
Not quite as much is all I'm saying.
I love DIablo balance.
We buffed it by a factor of ten and now we're nerfing it by a factor of 8.
Oh thank god I've got 50m.
ChaosSmurf thats an overall doubling still though!
They intentionally overbuffed it to get people to play with it.
Looking forward to these balance philosophies in season patches for SC2.
If they had a public test system.
They totally oculd do that.
And nothing bad would happen.
Dob what's the actual name of the B in RWBY?
MoonWolf did you hear about the physics in Fallout 4 being tied to the FPS?
Ty Dob knew you'd know.
No but it was that way in skyrim.
So thats not a suprise.
Noelor it doesnt.
Games are just giant while loops.
Each loop is a frame.
Just don't ask me to get all the names right of JNPR Cardinal etc.
And also checks where things are what way they're going etc.
Now I'm not saying it's *good*.
Being y'know the most basic possible thing and what I learned in first year at uni.
Did you hear about Bethesda being terrible.
Because it's been THE SAME STORY FOR 10 YEARS.
Imagine if AssCreed came out with the kinds of bugs every fucking Beth game does.
Oh crap that's the time.
Yes that was that time.
Noelor vaguely finalised character sheet.
Any character sheet you make and present as finalised should have don't believe his lies written on the back.
MoonWolf I don't get it.
Its fancy dumb recipies.
I meant with the city.
Anathema Nifur was the Alchemical city our characters originally came from back in the First Contact game.
All I remember about that is ChaosSmurf shot me p.
Anathema try having a memory.
I remember basically nothing about that game except I wrote about 8000 words of fan fiction.
No wait like 15k.
Well. i remember it.
I think you maybe enjoyed it more than we did.
Sigh I need to clean my keyboard.
Is there an easy way to do that.
Personalyl i use a high powered compressor.
Compressed air? unused toothbrush?
Bleh none in the flat.
MoonWolf I have it doesn't work.
I might just buy a new one.
Because this one has been dodgy since I spilt sprite all over it a year back.
Anathema well at least Noelors references wasn't wasted on everyone.
And then clean it regularly.
Shame you don't live in Cambridge.
I'd donate my current one so I can buy a new one p.
Yep I imagine it right now ChaosSmurf raiding Cindie's with the lads from Fitzwilliam.
I knew you would.
Bleh exhaustion from yesterday catching up.
Wow buying mechanical keyboards is impossible jesus christ.
Anathema I was mentioning to the others but having at least a minor intimacy toward every other PC is probably a good idea.
So France has just declared a state of emergency and closed their borders.
Fuck me some of the total fucking shite on twitter tonight.
Like what the fuck is this supposed to mean.
I don't want to tweet about how shite people are being and add to the problem but fucking hell.
I have luckily not gotten any of that on my end.
Re-reading the section on solar xp.
Night experience is a dick to acquire.
Are there types of XP.
What is this DD 1st ed? p.
There's xp which you get 5 of for showing up.
Then there's solar xp.
How many are actually going to bother following this?
Everyone gets 2 for developing their character or for roleplaying them well.
And then each person gets another 2 for being a good representation of their caste.
With lists of what each caste can do to earn their caste xp.
And night's is assassinate steal do criminal things.
While dawn's is get in fights.
Twilight's is be a smarty-pants.
This is half a page in the book.
I just got mooned from upstairs while taking trash out.
No idea how on purpose it was but there was laughter so w/e.
Which is clearly the best response.
!note MairBear did you have any ideas about this bitter rival of Kudrani's?
Well my plan for a short friday didn't really work.
Well its 3am and I just got home.
I believe karaoke is happening upstairs.
This is the only reasonable explanation for the volume at which I can hear Cyndi Lauper right now.
You should go join them.
Sounds like they're having fun.
Don't you want to have fun too?
I don't think y'all understand how the English work.
Then go against the norm.
Be bold make new friends. Make yourself look ridiculous in front of others.
!note MairBear you're short by either 3bp or 3 specialties on Kudrani btw.
ChaosSmurf that D.VA calls herself MVP.
Also I just played in a game where enemy D.VA and I simultaneously nerfed each other and died.
Play of the game for her not me =<.
ChaosSmurf Hollywood's victory screen is so Blizz.
Noelor I don't remember it.
Well you guys went to bed late.
I have dailies for heroes!
I meant to launch HS x.
I'm going to play hots anyway.
Well fine! I'll come along too!
Okay guess i'll be in mumble then.
And i queued withot you.
This game really doesn't like you.
I have to play this.
Or wait for it to end.
Anathema I can't remember if I said last night in the end but I have 11-12 more sessions planned of this Exalted campaign there will be a break over xmas I expect.
Even if you cant see her face my character is clearly getting real tired of this shit.
Meanwhile weather report in finland.
The colour coding on that subreddit is p cool.
Dob you home all afternoon?
Er yeh should be.
I had spare flat keys cut this afternoon.
Giving one set to my folks you okay keeping the other?
For if I lock myself out or w/e.
I'll be over in a bit then.
Does anyone want a Blizzcon code.
To watch archives and get the in-game goodies.
I've just found one in my e-mail.
Bung it into Bnet's register game bit.
It's a good one.
I really like the OW one tho.
Yeah it looks pretty sweet.
But fuck making a facebook account.
I did the facebook thing and didn't even get it.
Yeah it was right at the start.
And I think it bugged out.
Anyway yeah I totes have spider mount from doing the facebook thing.
I think you were Leoric.
I decided to run a bath.
Because I have a bath in my flat.
It is a bath/shower ie a bath with a shower head over it.
I worked out the first time I wanted a shower how to switch the water to come out of the shower head.
I have no fucking clue how to switch it back.
Adventures in the life of Noelor.
So I'm filling the bath from the shower head a couple meters up the wall.
Fill the bath from the shower head ez.
Im sure there a thingamabob you need to press while turning on a doohickey.
I found my notes at my folks'.
The mountain region says Climb to the top of the mountain.
Past you is a jerk.
Noelor you probably pull the thing back out.
Also I do that all the time and it takes about 30 minutes.
Desert Bus is back.
Ah yeah Desert Bus for Hope is soon-ish.
One of the guys at the cafÃ© is volunteering for admin for it.
I wanna play Diablo.
Why is Diablo not up.
He's having too much fun in the Nexus.
Grey and cold means better to stay inside and play Halo 5.
What kind of weather is giong to lead you to play a good game instead ?
MoonWolf the one the gives me a proper internet and gives me my desktop back.
Which will luckily happen next week.
The Goat Committee was founded in 1992. srs bsns.
Oh yeah the GÃ¤vle goat is serious as all hell.
? <- now Fallout 4 is complete.
Youtube lp vid description Holy shit I am so goddamn bad at this game why would you watch this.
I am physically capable of doing those.
I have no idea.
This will get me to 50 fo sho.
I still have 7/4's of a level to go.
And then again on the other class.
Welll the bard is...
Bard in the dungeon i just did.
Well there's a niche.
Got a menu in the door this morning from a takeaway that does not only european and asian cuisines.
But also booze cigarettes.
The i don't have time for this shit takeaway.
The no seriously I'm *never* leaving my house takeaway.
Oh I poured myself a drink then left it in the kitchen.
I saw an article the other day.
About a gamer that didn't leave his house for a year.
But I didn't want to read it.
Biographies of yourself are hard to read.
I have been to America twice in as many weeks.
All LPs are secretly narrative self-insert LPs. That's the secret Medibot with harsh truths.
Even the narrative ones that are not secret ?
Noelor you can add Strange Mountain to this.
OP should not have even partially expected that to work.
Not sure why they ever expected that to work.
<- I want to hire these guys to ride up and down the street in front of my friends house in 2 weeks.
Right after his 30'th birthday.
When my prediction is he will have a hell of a hang over.
Yu might be evil.
Cooked_Auto well i don't have Detect Evil Through Irc.
So i can't be sure.
I'd play the RPG that had Detect Evil Through IRC.
Late 90s/early 00s DnD.
Isn't that just a Mind / Correspondance effect in Mage?
Quick question has mass combat been reworked for e3?
An army is just a single-combat enemy that consists of multiple opponents.
You no longer wear them.
You can be one or tell one to do things.
I miss the Elegant Dance of Bow Blade grouping of War charms from 2.5.
I appreciate that they're mostly pointless in Ex3.
It was a fun fantasy.
One of my players really wants an army. again.
I'll have to see how it goes. And if the army pisses me off too much I'll murder it off around the time the characters exalt I guess.
I hit max level in HotS I guess.
Time to play ranked.
Morales Uther Abathur Vikings Falstad.
Im not sure thats true.
If you have time.
I just unlocked the next story trail.
Nah best team vikings nova zeratul abathur murky.
Moonwolf fine by me. MairBear around and not dying of superflu?
If not there is always another time.
Thats fast as well I can run it even without mair.
Logging in logging in.
Aw yis NOLF LP.
!note MairBear if not there is always another time.
Tahts not want i wanted at all.
Thats not a crossbow at all.
A catapult is not a bow either.
All I can say about the latest Poppy update as spotted on co is That's an entrance for sure.
Nah s'not all that.
Yeah feeling shitty I hope you guys haven't waited all day for me MoonWolf.
Nah we did the thing.
Lancer is now level 50.
Goign to push whitemage to 50 tomorrow with leveling duty roulette.
MoonWolf I'm at the same point on Tyrael as you were last night.
Last game unless it's super quick.
Which guarantees it will be.
Because ofcourse it works that way.
Looks like it'll be 13 something.
Really hope that's enough.
No more angel for me.
The power of dogs.
MoonWolf I have successfully scienced!
Ice wall does stop payloads.
Albeit not for super long.
<- arkham horror.png.
Arkham horror isn't really that bad just ridiculously expensive.
At least its not Twillight Imperium.
Ice wall does stop payloads <- woop.
A lot of ram.
That gif is top gif.
Dogmeat is no Diamond Dog thats for sure.
Nobody has ever called a screenshot exciting.
Don't lie to me MoonWolf.
Speaking of I'm fairly sure Noelor's wrong.
I've had an ice wall clipping through a cart I'm pushing.
With no ill effects.
MoonWolf odds are from what my father had and how far in it I am.
Now i'm just conflicted.
That I won't be suitable for games.
Give me some context here MairBear.
I have a strong flu thing and judging from how my dad was it might take even as much as the weekend for me to be totes recovered.
I'll ask again tomorrow if you're still down i'll reschedual.
MairBear is S4 of Arrested Development worth watching?
Anathema it's not -as- good. The first episodes seem bad. But are actually cleverly written as the entire season happens in a very short time period.
MairBear tell your dad he's a jerk for letting you get sick.
MoonWolf I told him to tell the one who brought it into the office that he's an ass.
Dat S3 ending though.
Are you still subbed to WoW Mair.
ChaosSmurf ... accidentally yes.
I kinda wanna go get the new heirlooms.
They did them in Panda right? the ones that scaled to 100. Are they still in there when teh pre-expansion patch launches?
The Garrosh ones k.
ChaosSmurf I got a Play of the Game last night as D.Va.
This meant that everyone else in my game got to watch me blue myself up along with 3 opponents because I ran into a wall =V.
Play of the game!
I am also routinely getting #1 objective-scorer on payload maps as D.Va now.
By standing on top of the car blasting everyone with infinite lasers.
And having that defense grid thing up ?
Does that defend against high noon ?
You'd need to time it right though.
Girl in the office just said it looked like I'd lost weight I have.
Were you in mumble the time I won Hanamura because my team was me as D.Va plus 2x Pharah LÃºcio Widowmaker?
Don't believe so ?
Well turns out Hanamura only favours the defense if the attackers all agree to stay on the ground.
Wait no yes i was there.
With a team of flyers and spidermen fuck your chokepoints.
Tldr I'm loving OW more than expected.
At least someone is.
I don't even have it installed anymore.
The tutorial is so bad.
Oh sure anathema got a key but not me?
Minister So you'd say your favourite ship right now is D.Vacer? P.
Glenn if its any relief to you I don't have one either p.
Cooked_Auto that's not even slightly what I said so no.
Minister No I'm joking with the fact that those two are your favourite characters.
That's... also not true.
Is she doing fingerguns in it? 3.
1322 the tutorial is so bad <--- it is literally 5 minutes long?
It isn't literally 5m long.
It's like 3 rooms.
It's also pointless unless you have never played a video game before admittedly.
So why are you defending it?
I'm not it's not very good and clearly non-final but I have no idea why anyone would ever quit and uninstall over it.
He's saying that's a crazy reason to uninstall a game.
Especially one in beta.
Particularly someone who had played video games before and therefore didn't need it.
I didn't quit and uninstall over the tutorial.
Then why even bring it up.
Those prescriptive herons are just the worst.
THrall's been playing a Rivendare + reincarnate deck again.
If you're asking me not amazing Dx.
I was actually asking about Thrall.
But am also disheartened to hear you're once more in Grandpa Nurgle's embrace.
MairBear i liked how in the final lancer quest your rival guy tries to cutscene powerup but you just fucking oneshot him before he even gets to finish.
The monk one was dumb.
Oh I need to open all my chakra. The only way we can do that is by killing each other even though I like you really die pls. Oh you beat me without killing me and unlocked it yourself.
And in the whitemage one A-Towa-Cant shows up to go btw they were being literal when they said you have my soul now enjoy.
Also we made a tree less angry or something.
FFXIV Tree Anger Management Simulator.
Most major gridania questslines are just a tree is angry at something.
Twelveswood why are you even.
It took 50 levels.
But they finally gave me an emergency heal.
That thing would have been nice 20 levels ago.
When we were doing brayflox.
MoonWolf it was fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.
A shame the hood on this outfit is down.
But at least i look like a proper whitemage now.
I was being slightly hyperbolic and left out a lot. But it did seem a bit well this is strange to me.
I don't actually mind.
MoonWolf you'll be happy to know that I am currently reviewing a PR to make our framework more multicultural.
Including support for displaying things in your silly number formats.
My number format is objectivly superior to your number format.
Even though the only difference is the switched . and.
Do you use . for coordinates instead of ?
We use for coordinates.
Optimized queues my ass.
Average wait time 5 minutes time in queue 55 minutes.
GlennCuttlefish i know how that feels now!
Arriving Friday 13 Nov. On the way hmmmm.
MoonWolf Suddenly a BG update O.
Cooked_Auto its the lp that will never die.
Well short of catastrophical computer failure.
Something that will put the jAIDS to shame.
So how are you feeling today mair.
*Slurps a coughed out lung back in*.
I've yet to reach the point of mental fatigue where I can't think of anything at all. Though so I've got that going for me.
Mair are you ok.
So mair are you ok.
Are you ok mairbear.
You've been hit by.
You've been struck by.
Kirisu did you forget to close your mumble or something.
Hey MoonWolf wanna run next part of story at some point?
GlennCuttlefish yes when you get back from your afk'ing.
I keep underestimaing the amount of time it takes to roast carrots.
MoonWolf fallout 4 has a voiced protagonist.
Anathema also has a conversation wheel.
Oh i didn 't mean wheel.
I mean conversation direction b uttons.
No mor ethan 4 options EVER.
Casuals ruining my games.
I've not had time to read it yet.
Damnit FF talk is rubbing off on me.
I needs must pay more attention to my patterns of locution.
Full glad are you?
Lack of voiced protagonist is why Dragon Age is garbage.
How do you keep doing that smurf.
Its like you are trying for the world record of being wrong.
I'll have to make a new steam category for disgaea when i buy it.
Glenn Hey being wrong did score him a job.
C_A yes and you have no idea how upset that makes me. This is why I dont trust game journalists.
Amazing animation in that.
Just wish the track was a bit better.
!note MairBear if you could let me spectate a HS match today that'd be great.
You sound like someone who would play Hunie Pop wow shots fired.
Most of the txts from my mum are a single letter.
Many from my dad are half a screen long.
Txts from my dad are so long they break my smart watch.
And I only ever get the final 160 chars on my wrist.
Kirisu i think your dad is bad at texting.
Fallout 4 Fuck Legendary Mirelurks.
Oh you shot it with your fancy laser musket. now its a legendary MUTATED mirelurk. its glowing with red energy now.
Hope you like that.
This game sounds awful.
Not that I was going to like it in the first place.
It was very satisfying to kill.
I had to take some drugs.
Also some 6 molotovs.
Does it least feel like you have to carefully scavange the relics of yesterday in a desperate attemp to survive the horrifying wasteland you live in?
I've heard that ammo and crafting mats are annoyingly rare?
Last night in WHFRP we escaped the stupid tomb at last I almost suffocated doing last rites over some bodies though and then our Dwarf fighty guy with a looted Gromril Breastplate... got possesed by the spirit of an ancient Khemrian warlord.
MoonWolf Should've gone with the nuclear baby option.
The Bretonian who put on a weird purple gauntlet which he now can't take off... almost turned into a Bloodletter of Khorne but luckily the wizard is Lore of Light and could banish it.
So now we need to cut off his arm.
Also we're running out of food and our ponies are gone.
Life is pretty bad for you right now.
Working as intended tbh.
It sounds like lots of fun.
Anathema also no i feels like i need to build a prettier settlement and aling my gourd patches better.
Also I will need to keep my eye on the wizard since he didn't let me destroy the evil helmet which probably cursed the dwarf.
Its obviously necromantic and he wants to study it. I'm a Priest of Morr necormancers are my worst enemy.
And the halfling is still a junkie.
Anathema yeah you need to grow food for your settlers.
This is not a spoiler its like quest 3 there are settlers now and you need to take care of them.
Since you are the only competent person in this videogame.
Guess I'm getting a PS4.
A good question mom.
Wait what the fuck.
I have serious questions about how that gun is being held.
The subtitle is the best part here I think.
Anathema why the fuck did the start building a kernel.
I mean i like c#.
Not building a kernel in it.
It wasn't significantly slower.
Yes our OS scheduler and memory manager was written in safe code. And all application- level and library code was most certainly 100% safe like our entire web browser.
You may be wondering what all this safety cost. Simply put there are things you can't do without pointer arithmetic race conditions and the like. Much of what we did went into minimizing these added costs. And I'm happy to say in the end we did end up with a competetive system.
So if they got upto a brwoser.
They already had a fully functioning kernel windowing system and network going.
I wonder why they scrapped it at that point.
But when you've got an OS kernel filesystem networking stack device drivers UI and graphics stack web browser web server multimedia stack ... and even the compiler itself all written in your safe programming model you can be pretty sure it will work for mostly anything you can throw at it.
Because Windows makes them all the money and it would mess up that.
Sure but then why even start.
To find ways to make windows better.
They knew before they started they'd have an incompatible OS that would have no community stuff to run on it at all.
Das i think ?
That should have a c in it maybe I'm not switching on German autocorrect or the fancy beta-looking 'ss' letter.
I can do those on command ÃŸ.
So i was wrong.
Aww what an adorable baby lasagna.
In what way does that look like a lasagne to you?
Lasanga is not lamb specific ?
I thought the default was beef.
It is if it is bolognese.
I hate that that's a sentence MoonWolf.
MairBear should have gone for schwarma.
I hate how english spells schwarma.
Its Shoarma you heathens.
It's from a language that uses Arabic script right?
That also helps with pronouncing it...
Why are we so bad at other languages.
MairBear how are you feeling.
And will you be able to talk and concentrate for about 3 hours tomorrow evening ?
If it's anything like I feel now.
If its not an enthusiastic Yes just say you can't.
I will be able to talk for about 30 mintues and concentrate for 40.
On that subject and for Minister sake no clue if they are reading atm . how about friday ?
I have found out why GlennCuttlefish enjoys hildibrand so much.
Even if the posing is good too.
Ellie is the only good part of this.
MoonWolf I'd hope I feel a bit better by then.
Everything about Hildi is good.
Just having a casual chat about falling pots with Gilgamesh.
MoonWolf you looked at Rx before?
Never heard of it even.
I have heard of those.
Game shunted forward? Aight.
Good thing is back on track then.
Cooked_Auto mairbear is feeling under the weather.
MoonWolf I -adore- this server.
You know whwatver floats your boat.
If gay sonic in bondage is your thing.
Sadly probably not from this server.
Got it from the SA thread.
Yaoi and bondage are clearly listed as separate activities.
Minister i saw it more as a building up.
Furries gay sonic furries and gay sonic furries in bondage.
Yeah where is the shell for straight/bi/omnisexual sonic furries in Bondage and.
Pan- is the typical prefix there MairBear.
Not to be confused with Pan-Sexual.
Because it's Greek I think?
Yeah... dunno why Omni came first to mind.
Thats a very different kind.
MoonWolf does anyone in this FC wear shirts.
>Tracer is always targeted first by High Noon.
But only most of the time.
This amuses me for some reason.
Buh cannot be bothered to RP tonight -_-.
I will anyway probably because the alternative is board games with people I don't much like but buh nonetheless.
You don't like them? D.
MoonWolf are you really likely to have Geert Wilders are PM like someone on the internet is claiming?
Mor elikely than i like.
Less likely than they claim.
That part has frequently done very well in polls when they are in opposition and muslims are involved but then quickly drop in polls when actual campaigning starts.
Wish I'd found out Tesseract changed vocalist before booking tickets to see them live.
Oh shit also MoonWolf did you need that quest cleared today? Or can it wait for brawls tomorrow?
Not sure I liked my quests but can try to press a game out anyway.
Lets see what my druid's like.
Oh yay items with charges. Woo v.
Haha 11% gains for 1 hour.
Recastable item for the duration.
Guess that's the final final confirmation needed for the Specialist game studio rumor.
Ah so actually useful but doyou mean it goes away when the celebration ends?
The thunderfury wands and van cleef don't assuming they're not used up.
I shouldn't be sweating when I'm cold.
I shouldn't be shivering when I'm hot.
MairBear have you ever tried just _not_ having the flu?
R u havin' a giggle.
It did not work c.
MairBear i think you might have proper flue.
Rather than common cold.
Yeah my dad went in to work last monday.
He stayed at home every day since including today.
And he's not one that stays off for a bit of a snuffle.
MairBear look if you don't even want to get better I'm not going to help you.
I'm saying things people say to people with mental illnesses.
Have you tried not being depressed etc.
I'm not sure why we never tell you to stop being depressed.
My best friend is a huge huge depressive c I've learned from him that people that say that shit are just assholes.
MoonWolf hard as it is to believe I do actually talk to people outside this channel sometimes p.
Yeah but why are you giving MairBear grief over it.
It's all in good fun or ana's suddenly eviller xD.
Anathema no stabbing at hogmany or I'll somehow transport the flu forward in time.
I'll see what I can manage.
MairBear just put some spit or something in a bottle and throw it over him.
Would I not also need some way to keep the bacteria alive.
Holy crap micheal cera does actually age.
Actually had a lot of fun RPing tonight.
We avoided the plotted fight by singing no player actually had to sing.
I trapped some sentient dirt in a balloon because YOU GAVE ME BALLOONS GM WHAT ELSE DO I DO WITH THEM.
Shoulda been made to sing casual GM.
Then someone poisoned me with emotion I am a nanobot hivemind.
So I got to be angry then someone cured me by poisoning me with love instead.
So I got to be drunk and stroke the party bruiser which was even more creepy than when they were angry.
I know the Daily Fail are morons is nothing new but this one showing their correspondent has clearly never seen Robocop is a good one.
When you see it.
Internet baby why do you gotta say these things.
I really should watch this season I think.
Did you know that as Jenga is manufactured they make sure the bricks are all of varying sizes and weights to make the game work better? if true that's pretty great.
Griffins not big on secrecy.
Noelor I completely forgot to mention I probably can't Exalted this Friday parents visiting.
This will also give MairBear a chance to not be superill.
The first genuinly good fallout 4 mod is here.
It unfucks the dialogue.
As far as it can be unfucked at any rate.
Now the major thing we need is to unfuck the pip boy interface.
And seperate out some keybinds.
Seriously why is power attack on the same button as throw grenade i've blown myself up with that more than once.
MoonWolf probably because of controllers.
Anathema sure but just take the time to make a seperate keybind.
Bethseda is always like its also on pc.
If you accept that we don't care about pc's interface or keybinds or anytihng.
Oh my god.
Also this needs a serious NSFW tag.
Even if its badly nsfw.
MoonWolf after the skyrim ui was it not obvious they don't care about the pc interface?
I keep thinking they must realize it was bad maybe they'll actually spend any time on it at all.
Finally a use for my octocore work cpu.
Anathema does 7zip use multicores ?
In fact I'm pretty sure zipping up some large collection of files is a standard benchmark for CPUs in hardware enthusiast websites.
Like the two reasons to use hyperthreading.
So fallout 4 has legendary guns which have cool modifiers.
It just so happens that explosive rounds apply to any projectiles coming out of your gun.
And shotguns have a lot of projectiles.
Some powers can't be used by a samurai and others don't make a lot of sense. Samurai typically settle for Additional Damage Combat Ability Regeneration and the occasional Flight sure that makes sense.
Yeah that makes sense.
Guess it does make sense in Tenra Bansho Zero.
Next Time Buddhist monks - You Wa Shock! Excellent.
Sure continents persih. But not in the same timespann as the other three.
There is a doomwhale.
Who is playing FO4.
I played a bit decided to buy it on steam when its on sale and an UI mod exists.
The UI looked garbage.
I'm gonna get it during Christmas.
And possibly stream myself playing it and getting drunk on Christmas day.
I'll download it in the next few weeks when I get a new graphics card.
Something tells me that it probably wont run on a GTX 460.
You might be surprised.
Though given that's worse than my card it's beyond the pale.
I'll get a new card on friday if I find a decent one for sale or just grab my cousins old card once he gets that GTX 970.
S'fair pissin' it down today tell you what.
Weather so bad Minister has gained a completly different accent.
Or he's been spending too much time in Limso Lominsa.
I doubt thats the case.
Yeah no-one can spend /too/ much time in Limsa Lominsa.
City in FFXIV where everyone talks in sailor / pirate / cockney accents.
Any time in limsa lominsa is too much time.
I think I'm on team Glenn for this one.
It has the best leader though.
Minister they are adding cho'gal to hots.
You should have it MoonWolf.
Oh right ticket gave cho'gal.
~MoonWolf I played a bit decided to buy it on steam when its on sale and an UI mod exists - Saw one posted on SA or twitter that fixed the dialogue system at least.
I posted about it earlier today.
Still doesn't solve the keybindings issue or the terrible inventory menu issue.
True but its a step in the right direction p.
Ah it was a Eurogamer link I just saw on my feed.
Until a friend of mine who knows people who work on it mentions apparently the response to the preorder and the trailers was so negative that they allocated more money to add some stuff in the engine which is kind of neat.
Does he wanna go on the record.
Leave that as speculation and nothing else.
Cooked_Auto's uncle who works at Squeentendo.
MoonWolf they actually released this brawl without destroying their own server?!
Before I even load battlnet.
Your entire deck is 2/3 pirates. Every turn you discover 3 random cards.
Is it because booty.
But you don't ever draw any more cards only discover.
SO LONG AS I GET MY BOOTY.
Do you get to pick your class.
For maximum pirate synergy.
MoonWolf by turn 9.
My opponent discovered 3 argent protectors.
MoonWolf as in Cho Gall are live now or soon?
Err. no the one that reduces your minion to 1 attack.
Unsure one or the other.
And then the legendary that does it to ALL your minions.
Is Thanksgiving this week?
Turns out that beneath the grounds does nothin gin this.
But discovering a soutsea capatain is great.
Never parrot so far D.
Genuinly laughed out loud.
For those of you who have FO4 friend linked a mod that removes silly chat-wheel for classic approach.
So you can see what you're actually saying.
Its like nobody even reads what i say at 8 pm in the morning.
Today is Calvin Hobbes 30th anniversary as a sidenote.
I need to see OPM.
MoonWolf Well yeah it's 8PM in the morning. So what do you expect p.
MoonWolf got a recruiter email My client has had some of the brightest minds in .NET software development working on this product for the past 3 years and feels it is now time to take the market by storm. Their ultimate goal is to overtake Google by 2020.
It does have nice benefits but they don't say where it is so its probably in London.
Anathema how does anyone put that in an email and go yeah thats legit this'll get so many people involved.
Can't figure out what company it is.
Flippin hate recruiters anonymising everything.
Its how they make their money why would you use a recruiter if you could go direct to the company?
Ftrbzzs we found out someone else is quitting Brady today kinda Alison maybe you never met her? isn't coming back from maternity.
Season 2 of community is probably the best.
I cba to filter them in my memory.
But between those two.
Well if roughl remember the sequence remedial chaos theory is near the start of s3.
Anathema she was there for a week before going on leave.
But that's interesting news.
Whole lot of wankers out on the blizzardses today who can't read patch notes.
MoonWolf yeah looks like two-headed ogre mode is live.
Ooh Jaina price drop.
She's pretty worth it.
Trying to figure out a next purchase.
Particularly if there's a couple of k waiting after chogall event.
Aw what they're removing Haunted Mines?
It's the most boring in the game imo.
I prefer ravenhollow to mines.
...the b.net client can't be copy-pasted from.
Heroes that are simultaneously struck by Diablo's Overpower and Stitches' Hook will no longer be thrown outside the playable area.
So does anyone want to ogre?
Cho'Gall doesn't qualify for any quests =M.
Oh nm patch had somehow reset the default mode to tutorial.
Goddamn I laughed too hard for that patchnote.
Can cho'gall be practiced upon?
You can practice as either of them.
I think as Gall you can ping the map to direct your Cho or something?
First game I queue up has Cho'Gall obviously.
Also Abathur and Morales.
Well you got a warrior a support 2 assassins and a specialist.
Noelor I'm confused how does cho and gall unlock? D.
MairBear you have to agree to play ogre with me.
Though still got the plague so might be shit.
If you went to blizzcon bought the virtual tkt you got him at the start of seeding process.
There may have been another random allocation of extras I dunno.
Gall marked 'easy' character.
You don't even have to move!
Can agree with that if it doesn't have to worry about positioning.
Hots-reddit had the initiative of chogall channel for spreading.
That's nice of them.
Has become I have chogall anyone wanna join me so they can get it.
I think Mair's the only possible victim on my friendslist.
The Hour of Twilight is nigh!
Also bonus of CG twice the chars to lvl to 5 for 500g ^^.
MoonWolf on a person who did not understand marinating he put frozen burger patties into coke for a couple hours then cooked them.
Today in resident evil I keep getting my head removed in various ways.
Dob Anathema and MairBear are here for hogmanay.
Also maybe Smurf? work dependent iirc.
That was an oxford lack-of-comma incidentally >.>.
Right I shall plan accordingly.
GlennCuttlefish I ended up on a youtube video compiling all 4 Jojo openings.
This 4th one is so much worse than the others is makes me a little sad >.>.
Noelor really? I think my curren ranking is 1>4>3>2.
Topic response I choose to be from Johto.
It's a gender joke *and* a pokémon joke because Noelor.
Cars also become uncontrollable on pavement when they travel at more than 45 kph. BattleTech.txt.
Maybe don't model cars in a system made to model bipedal robots.
No I think it has to do with speed.
This is Battletech. Open roads and pavement in general are a death sentence to fast mechs.
Looking to get in touch with a borough council.
The contact page on the website offers a number to txt them.
In 5 years they'll haev a twitter account.
They have a Flickr.
My brother has been tagged on Facebook dressed as a Japanese mascot.
Specifically a black pig who is so delicious he's always trying to eat himself.
That is kinda fucked up.
Anathema Japanese mascots are great.
I can't enable automatic windows updates.
Do they want us to all get cryptlocker?!
Anathema did you decide yet what part of the Isle Karuyo's from?
The bit with cities and famrs and slavery and lots of dragonblooded.
Minister I haven't even played videogames this week so no not yet!
Kirisu it's looking doubtful that I can even Kudrani tomorrow >.<.
Unless I suddenly pick up in the next 26 hours.
This bout of sickness fills me with DETERMINATION ... to get flu jabs forevermore.
Why are you saving your game?
I'm not Just trying to receive the free heals.
It took me an embarrassingly long time to realise that hall was happening.
MairBear its okay in about a week you'll be a functioning human being again and that determination will go straight into the trash.
I finally finished that last night though I saved and quit during the epilogue cos late.
I am still way early.
I have no clue what game this is about ?
I tried to barrel through because I have friends who were making in-jokes and trying to avoid spoilering so I wanted to get all the spoiler risk out of the way.
I also want that.
Well you have a life and a Cheers Love to deal with.
I had a total lack of brain to cope with anything other than something that showered me in giggles.
Anathema I have a document for a man with the second name Wanago.
And I can only read it in a Scottish accent.
Sounds closer to africa to me.
Oh it definitely is.
Because it's not spelled that way more letters I cba to phone type.
Maybe they haven't opened an ice rager yet.
Its the best alternative!
<- WELL THEN.
This is a HotS game /.
Cho'gall went to the lane with 1 enemy raynor followed zeratul is exploring the map.
So we have 1 empty lane vs 2 bots and one solo-vs 2 bots.
Mairnai people don't really get that cho'gal is 2 heroes that just happen to be glued to on spot on the map.
NSFW What even is this.
Pretty sure he should look into bi porn then or something.
Oh now that's just taking realistic robots too far.
Automated switchboard said it would connect me to someone then hung up.
Cooked_Auto that last one is fair tbh.
I was more giggling at the name.
I have come to the point in my life where I am more surprised actors are alive than not.
MoonWolf did you run qarn yet for your mainstory?
Just finished getting summoner up to 34.
Going to do more mainstory tomorrow i think.
Guess i'll run roulettes now then.
Blizzard's online clothing store has some... weirdness going on around womenswear.
So here's the array of shirts for ladies who like Overwatch.
Nearly every one is a slightly different cut.
The menswear page has all the same designs but each in exactly the same standard t-shirt cut.
MoonWolf flap when you have done with game~.
A flapping wolf how peculiar.
ChaosSmurf omg Kaplan's post-Blizzcon beard.
Might need to rewatch this because of Bryan Cranston.
Noelor after that game of yours would you like to join mairbear and i and possibly gimble ?
Probs going to switch to OW after my quest.
Noelor where did it come from!
But only wizards come from the moon.
Looks like the WoW server techs just turned the Beta servers on.
I assume that means it's not next week but the one after.
Since apparently there's a preview press thing going on at some point.
Cooked_Auto wizards and science apes.
In Overwatch beards come from the moon and Sweden.
Conclusion of a customer review on the Blizzard store I am not filled with sadness or regret due to this purchase so I'm gonna call this a win.
Sadness but hooray for skeleton.
So overwatch stress test this weekend I hear.
Have you checked your account.
Cuz e-mails are slow.
GlennCuttlefish I still don't have it if it makes you feel better =P.
>YOU'RE A BOOK! >A sassy book!
Another good fallout 4 mod.
Might need to buy this game soon.
Okay he just made a number of those up.
Well yeah wouldn't be much of a map otherwise.
This undermines my ejoyment!
!note MairBear they datamined some cool new d3 portrait frames May never see some of these because asia but they are cool.
I was wondering what I was doing wrong. As usual the answer is foreshortening.
Well this is interesting.
Are going to have to beat up the there must always be an on fire lichking ?
I guess he's gonna show up.
Ahahaha they stapled a midriff to sylvanas.
Guys guys everyone figured out we are just reusing the same bared midriff base model for all our sexy important plot npcs.
What do we do.
I KNOW bad leather covering on sylvannas.
Now they can't tell!
I didn't remember miniskirts came in lalafell sizes.
Just what i wanted in my life.
I didn't actually want this in my life.
I will now transmog this into every piece of gear I wear as THM.
Grmbl I almost have to hurry if I want to get my roulette done as THM today.
You still have like 3 hours or so ?
GlennCuttlefish i got to the quarn bit.
How have you two been getting on in the storyline?
Sort of waiting for both you and GlennCuttlefish to be available so we can run 500 different hardmodes.
Which I wont be until late sunday.
Run storymode ahead without me we can do qarn today I think.
I doubt MairBear feels up to hardmodes.
I still have a few hours.
I don't have to finish the game inside of the month.
Not like i'm racing to endgame here.
I can possibly DPS them.
Will have to see at the tame.
Mair I started leveling DPS.
What dps are you leveling ?
Thm I would guess.
Play some ranger or something.
I want to do play DPS mair.
Summoner is good fun!
Oh yeah this quest. I had forgotten this lovely go get that urn. its just past those level ?? mobs over there.
I want to do play DPS mair <hahahahaha.
The laugh was at the response of MCH rather than you being dps you being dps is totally plausible.
I should get access to the Legion beta today \o/.
What will actually be interesting to people and not immediately found by MMOC.
You can play an edgelord sorry i mean demonhunter.
Thats why i said it.
I wonder if the tanking spec is in yet.
Wait I have already cleared my todays roulette? Grmbl.
MoonWolf wanna run qarn about nowish?
Just getting a quick cup of coffee and we can go.
This is the first Friday I've been at work since before I moved house.
Relatedly this is the longest I've gone without playing Overwatch since getting into the beta.
And I really wanna play Overwatch >.>.
Its just an fps Kirisu.
And they patched it!
GlennCuttlefish what difficulty of qarn?
Normal doing it right now.
Though I'm coming up to the last boss of my own Qarn.
Vanessa Vancleef is a follower v.
Well the emerald nightmare is like.
ChaosSmurf garrison follower or rogue hall... I think they're called champions?
Also yeah the Nightmare has existed as an explicit corrupt-o-zone since... Vanilla? WC3 maybe?
And I think technically that's not corrupt Ysera so much as her dark reflection though it's functionally the same I'll admit.
Punch evil ysera untill the emeral nightmare goes away.
I need this mod in my life.
ChaosSmurf its inventory is massive its paperdoll is n ice looking it has a seperate space for charms so they don't clutter your inventory.
I was going through my music library.
It has a completly redone UI.
And suddenly I have an urge to play minecraft again.
Those hp and mana globes swirl D3 style.
This album was so good for minecraft music.
What even is the point then.
An elaborate ARG for HL3?
All of steam has been an elaborate ARG all along.
HL3 is actually EVERY GAME EVER.
Oh yeah forgot to check this.
Pretty sure sitting on her tail that way would hurt a lot.
Noelor what's the joke with hall champions then.
Thats the github logo.
Teaser trailer for the new Valkyria game.
That seems a reasonable amount of armour for fighting a giant mech.
The best toaster. The Best.
Please please please release new VC on pc.
You'll most likely have to wait a while.
As long as its not 5 years or so.
Cooked_Auto tanks are cool.
Pretty good stabilization test if anything.
Is lightning returns the mad time travel one.
Or is that XIII-2.
I think its the former. Or at least the Lightning trilogy slowly goes over into strange time travel stuff.
Anathema Quite so.
MoonWolf you know the answer.
ChaosSmurf iirc from Blizzcon it's just that everyone in your class obvs will always see exactly the same cast walking around your hall.
And they're all people who you run into out into the world.
So like it's 100% Yrels and Thisalee Crows and junk rather than your RNG crowd out of the tavern and that cat dude you rescue etc.
Is Yrel going to be in the Paladin one.
Might have to reroll paladin.
Well they did ruin warrior afterall.
They didn't ruin it.
They just didn't do anything to it.
Which is equally bad when Shadow Priests get to basically be C'Thun.
Pretty sure you can ignore that characterization.
Except shadow priests never asked to be C'Thun.
I mean sure there's going to be C'Thun's son/daughter PCs now even more so.
ChaosSmurf XIII-2 was all-in on time travel.
Like trying to be Chrono Trigger but not getting it visiting the same places in different periods.
I think the over-arching plot of Lightning's story means time travel is still an element in LR though?
Zeratul player. Has Nova portrait. Har.
He's all about the super cool heroes.
Oh I've forgotten this one.
Still continues to deliver all is good.
This is apparently a cloth set.
Not convinced you can see out of this.
I'd like it more with sleeves tbh.
Watching a German version of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes reconfirms my standard bias that German is the ideal screaming language. Haha.
There were guys at work today repairing an automatic door.
They were talking about wires and my brain went straight to that game.
Actually watching a german LP just because I want to hear this.
What Im amused more right now is the way they have random English words sprinkled in the German like they say wires in English.
I even get some of the stuff they're saying.
The warbringer talent now gives charge AoE stun.
Everything I've ever needed.
Wait he's married?
I really like John Blanche's art.
Still 4 more levels of the endless paths to go.
Doesn't seem very endless then.
After that it just resets and he has to do it all over again but he gets a gold star in front of his name.
MoonWolf are you ready for the latest episode of Noelor realises what isn't in their kitchen?
This is an exciting show.
I have only one mixing bowl.
And it is going to be just too small to make cookies in.
That is a little limiting.
And I realised this after measuring out butter and sugar.
Is this a dough or a batter ?
I was going to suggest just mixing it on the counter but that won't work out that.
Anyway I'm off to sainsbury's because dammit I want to make cookies this weekend -.
And what have you.
I'm good at 3 letter acronyms.
I mean you could also brb.
It wouldn't help my cookies.
Or go with bbl.
Or I guess syl works even better.
I now have cookie batter.
And my oven is heating up.
Which brings me to a question about ovens is everyone else's oven marked in 20-degree increments?
Because all two ovens I've used previously were but the one in my new place is 25-degree increments for some reason.
And it makes heating to 180C a bit more annoying than it should be.
I think mine ends at 250C.
And does it in increments of 25.
Yup thats a flag alright.
Ok the # was fucked by casing.
Press page down like once.
Fuck it they'll cool on the tray I.
I'm going to start watching a Life is Strange LP.
See how it goes.
I should play it now thats its finished.
She was like a battery negative and positive it's a good thing I know this game is aiming at sounding pretentious because it nails it.
From what Ive seen it comes off as very This is how teenages totally talked in 00's.
It seems that when skaters are not grinding and sliding on their decks they are grinding and sliding with their dicks. I nearly spat cider.
I understand that the teens are Extremely Sexy but maybe as a new thread rule please don't photoshop any of them into sex haha.
This is something I saw on tumblr which is usually the preface to something awful this is an unfortunate turn of phrase in a goon LP.
It is.
A friend's post about looking for advice for running a pathfinding group.
Turns out not the dd 3.5 variant but god squad bollocks.
ChaosSmurf I never thought I'd miss Volskaya but this restricted map pool for the stress test is so bad -.
Its way to cold in my room.
8c in my room atm.
Wait no gone up to 9.
Okay tis not THAT cold.
This is why I have two duvets p.
Mine is 14 but going up quickly.
Do you remember much about the endless paths of od nua?
Not beyond the first 6 or so.
I was going to replay it.
But then i ended up replaying Divinity instead.
I'll pick it up again with exapnsion part 2.
Oh ok you wont know about what I was going to complain about then.
Fuckin' Charm effects though man.
Charm or dominate ?
Is there a difference?
Yeah charm just makes them not contribute to the fight anymore i believe.
Dominate is straight up mind controll attack your own friends.
In that case I mean dominate.
Anything below 20 is too cold.
I think I remembered how to warrior in gw2.
Hit people with your greatsword.
There is more to it than that!
Use the pointy end?
I was positively surprised by the warrior when I started leveling one up.
Quite a lot to think about.
Inb4 this is the paladin shield.
You typo'd rad as hell.
ChaosSmurf nah that's got to be warrior.
Paladin shield would be all golden and shit.
Have books hanging off it.
At least two possibly three of those steamy romance novels look like they come straight outta darknest.
Thinking my FF subscription is only 5 days i should add time to that before it expires inconveniently.
An entry level subscription cannot be purchased until your standard level subscription expires. <- GAAAH.
The free 30 days counts as the more expensive kind off subscription i don't need.
It need to actually expire.
Ftrbzzs fucken mesmers.
Delete mesmers from game.
MoonWolf my cookies turned out ok \o/.
Fuck cooling trays anyway.
They would have fallen apart on a tray a bit.
They're a little undercooked but just in terms of being softer than ideal.
Which is probably *why* they're a little undercooked the recipe was for smaller I guess.
Noelor pics or your cookies didn't happen.
*Later* So I ran out of cookies.
Wouldn't betray us that way.
Played a map as bastion.
Because nobody else wanted to turret.
Was awful but still got play of the game.
Anathema mesmers rock I want a mirror dress too!
You might be a horrible human being IF.
You say things like ftrbzzs.
I'm sure Anathema agrees -.
I drown the harsh reality of being a horrible human being by drinking lots of whisky.
I just had a game in which our team was.
Bastion x2 D.Va x2 Trace.
We were *on attack*.
That was not a winning team.
I mean the tracer was helping.
The second D.Va was pointless.
The two bastions what even.
You know I won't get insulted if you just spell it as Torbjorn p.
Yeah that's probably what the recip is based on.
The cookie part is peanut butter cookies.
And the jam is strawberry also goes all the way through by mistake because I made my divots too deep.
Also spelling wrong annoys me probably more than you.
In exchange for your image of baked good i offer another image of baked goods.
I will take your word for it that those are baked.
They look like omelettes.
I know they are not pretty.
And maybe the lighting?
Hello would someone like to come and win a game of hearthstone to get me a pack.
I wanna play Overwatch with you I.
That is a thing i'm porbably capable of ChaosSmurf.
MoonWolf are they turnovers?
They are totally appel turnovers.
They're called apple turnovers in the UK.
Noelor too much TV to watch.
Yeah there is that.
I haven't even been TVing this year.
Yeah last tv-show I watched was a re-watch of Generation Kill last year or so vOv.
Other than that its occasional anime and documentaries for dinner.
And some movies when I stream for skype people.
ChaosSmurf get pyroblast every time.
DIDN'T EVEN LET MY PYROBLAST.
Pretty accurate depiction of Johanna tbh.
Forgot the part where she blinds everyone.
That is later in the video.
Man illidan just get so shit on.
Carbot senpai never makes shorts for my vaourite game.
Don't suppose anyone feels like helping me level ogres?
I can help you level ogres but i already have ogres so you won't get any ogre money credit.
Nah just after the level 5 prize.
No time to mumble ?
We'll see ow this goes.
Cho'gal + abathur is a bad bad idea.
As i say that.
We get matched to another abathur.
On another 3 lane map.
Three heroes one body.
I mean the power level works.
But the map presence is shit.
Yo ujust perma loose a lane.
It's not great no.
Otoh actually the 2-lane diablo map.
Yeah i thought it was the other one.
This isn't so bad.
Yeah but Zagara and Azmodan.
Push all the lanes.
Abathur not present. Choice illogical.
Dob ogre + abathur is -2 bodies.
An interesting map balance.
Pretty bad on 3 lane maps actually.
Fine on 2 lane.
Simple just pick vikings to balance out.
Its unit fucky the team.
That Valla costume is rad.
Watched the first episode of Jessica Jones ealier seems better than Daredevil.
Noelor i just crashed.
Also so a cormorant on my run.
Not seem one close up before!
Specifically colour scheme #2.
If I'm reading this right.
The way warriors get to their class hall.
Is they literally jump there.
Reconfirming that shadow priests are the best new spec they have a talent called Legacy of the Void and another called Reaper of Souls.
I see they're not even trying anymore with the references.
In that they're being exactly as blunt as they ever were.
Ahahaha Surrender to Madness.
The fish sense something amiss perhaps its time to move to another location.
Ah yes. Anti botting mechanic.
Forgot to tell you about that.
But thats trivial to work around as a bot.
Even though 96% off fish are worthless.
I never ran into this thing.
So I was at an internet meeting this weekend.
We had running water most of the time.
Which cannot be said about electricity.
Which was out the whole time.
And the alcohol ?
No complaining about the alcohol.
There was punch there was vodka in it.
FFXIV is finally remembering Join party in progress flags? O.
I can't decide if the arcanist guild or the fishermens guild has the worst guildleader.
Finally managed to listen to Hadestown on the way over pretty good album.
Well assuming you like folk/stuff like tom waits and peculiar pretzelmen.
Glenn or Moon any dungeons you want to do?
MairBear we have a whole bunch of dungeons we want actually.
I can do the gamings. I can do a light bit of the talkings.
Also whoever sang the part of hades in hadestown has the voice of some kind of gravel god.
Now if only moonwolf answered.
Glenn what duty are you searching for?
I want to do any hardmode.
Ah so not something I can help out with.
Well moonwolfs here. Withdrawn from queue.
Of course v.
Assholetep is amazing.
Welp. It has finally happened.
Even had a bit of snow last night.
I think we got around 30cm of snow over the weekend.
In my case it was like 1cm v.
Fortunately I am at home.
But it surprised me regardless since it was talk of a green winter.
Yeah we had snow here friday night mostly gone on saturday though just a patch left on the back lawn.
Really never normally been as early as november.
Its oddly late in the year for snow.
Come to mumble Noelor.
Everyone is very bored of me talking about WoW.
Will you play Overwatch with me? I.
No I just played it for like 5 hours.
I want to play overwatch <.
Excellent useage of the pipboy.
Cold as balls today to cycle in.
I need to get gloves with figners.
Damn the menu for the work christmas party looks good.
Anathema whisky on the menu?
Also is it in Cambridge this year?
Anathema it's a nice place good wine.
Make sure they give you good wine..
I'm sure there will be not that I'd notice a good wine p.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Oh well just ask for a good single malt and you'll be fine.
Ftrbzzs do you have different gloves for cycling in the winter or do you always use your motorcycle ones?
Anathema I only used the motorcycle gloves in winter in the UK.
Here I'll have to swap something warmer on.
Found an article on a cycling website listing some of the best ones -> none are available on amazon |.
Anathema check wiggle and read the recommendations there.
You should be able to find decent ones.
Maybe later should actually do some work now.
Anathema you have a junior just make him do your work and browse interwebs.
He isn't in yet.
I forgot to grind coffee last night.
I had to pack away coffee and espresso machine for moving.
Have to live a day without coffee.
Coffee grinder that is.
One of the guys in work is doing movember and he looks like a short skinny Nappa atm.
Alright new as in hand me down new winter jacket is pretty cozy. Now I just need to dig out a scarf for my face. Cant hide inside the jacket sadly without hunching over.
Noelor what's the deal with New Years.
ChaosSmurf me and probably Mair will be there.
I'm planning to get a tiny cube PC.
So I might come and bring that.
I'm heading down on the 28th if you want to try and get the same train.
NOBODY CARES BUT ME.
That is pretty cool.
Shame the game looks like butts.
ChaosSmurf now you can see the whole zone at once and realize how tiny it is.
Because you won't be able to fly.
Well how big would a modern container ship be in N scale?? This big O_o.
Here's an old first-generation container ship in N scale it's 3' long.
Here's a 28 long feeder container ship.
Model Scale in this case.
N scale is a popular model railway scale. Depending upon the manufacturer or country the scale ranges from 1148 to 1160.
ChaosSmurf the scale most commonly used by train people.
But yeah goes to show how massive modern cargo ships are.
I don't know why I'm laughing so much at that.
GlennCuttlefish have you unlocked the great king moggle mog fight ?
Mainly been working on BLM today. I can do it in a bit.
Its only mostly walking around for bullshit busywork.
But i'd like to see if we can beat up a giant moogle tonight.
Moonwolf I have unlocked the thing.
If mairbear feels like it we can do The Thing.
The best high school ~drama~ story I've got was our class superlatives where this one guy won worst driver and he got so mad he punched out a window. It was like one of those little windows in an inside door that had chicken wire in it so he cut the crap out of his stupid shitty hand.
A tweet about Bethesda games.
ChaosSmurf wtd is going on with these druid forms?
Btw OW should be back up but I'm gonna go play Legion.
This is allegedly a gun.
The rogue artifact daggers have Ashbringer bits.
Assbanger's ones are further up though.
That is a repeat Qwertee.
Yeah thye do that occasionally.
I think I'll go to bed early for once.
Look at the clock 5am. I am good at this sleeping thing.
Why did my VM reboot.
If Dark Heresy has taught me anything it is that the guilty are quick to protest their innocence and that innocence proves nothing.
Today is going to suck.
We need fixes for critical issues turned around in 24 hours.
Is that an SLA for customer or internal?
Something Hobbs said because Geneva are complaining about a bug in the cross-dataservice querier and Pete isn't in this week so I need to look at it but I'm 75% sure there is nothing that can be done.
Also Nevada devs don't understand c#.
ChaosSmurf wasn't me I was out last night.
Seems there was issues last night.
Anathema better just switch to a RHEL based service for better uptime..
I have an irrational dislike for rpm-based distros p.
Anathema but RHEL is fedora based nowadays..
Come to the fedora side we have whisky!
Fedora is rpm based!
Rpm is the packaging system.
Are you moved into your new place yet?
Yeah moved all boxes yesterday.
Unboxing them is a different story..
All my books have been in boxes for.
As long as you unbox the important stuff your computer.
And literally nothing else.
Anathema we have four bicycle boxes in the middle of the living room atm.
I could start my own spinning class with the damn things.
Anathema but the first thing we did was that we unboxed the espresso machine.
Espresso machine and whisky.
That's about what's out at the moment.
Then it's desktops and tables and chairs.
When we get our delivery today.
Anathema most exciting moment is going to be when I try and start my PC again after about 15 months.
It'll never come back.
Why is my cell 185115px wide.
-D ha ha ha ha.
Anathema what do you think of the new PoE expansion.
Oh shit I forgot that was gonna be announced.
Its true they are not worth taking.
ChaosSmurf looks boss slight concern with lag over the traps.
Lags over the traps ?
PoE Ascendancy looks to have loooots of traps to avoid.
The interview that I'm writing up now.
The dude says they probably overplayed the number of traps in the trailer.
And it's a bit lower.
Not specifically expansion related but I hope they have toned down physical damage since the last league.
Btw wtf is the model for this game.
Do you pay for cosmetics or what?
Cut of the AH?
F2p pay for extra stash tabs and cosmetics.
You have enough to start with.
That seems v. free tbh?
But if you see the amount of STUFF people hoard in the game over a season.
Yeah its pretty free.
I've never been a cosmetics guy but in Diablo I extra don't care what my character looks like.
ChaosSmurf yeah its pretty generous.
It's all just numbers porn.
I believe last expansion PoE finally got into giving people wings.
MoonWolf now you can buy old quest reward gems you didn't pick you don't even need to hoard gems!
Anathema yeah now you just need to hoard every itme that might be worth money to put in your sales topic on the official forum so the automatic sales tools cna parse them so you can sell items.
Not Going To Kill You-ade.
The hype for Legion's transmog system is infectious.
I'm actively looking forward to logging in and it going HERE'S ALL THE STUFF YOU'VE EVER GOTTEN FROM ANY QUEST.
I think I just get excited by large database calls.
Man that is going to break so fucking hard on day one.
They're introducing a wardrobe for transmog.
And it's oging to look at every quest you've ever completed and every item you've ever picked up.
And give it to you as a wardrobe item.
Including all the quest items you didn't pick.
Yeah it's pretty rad just from a tech standpoint.
It was the loudest cheers I heard at Bcon I didn't realise how hot people were for it.
Is PoE's camera isometric.
Or is it one of those things that looks exactly like isometric but 3 people get really mad if youc all it that.
One of those yes.
Gonna call it that.
ChaosSmurf isometric is technically a ver specific angle.
I don't know if its on that angle.
This is what the three people say.
They need to learn about the evolution of language.
I said to myself I'd only link him to one of these a day.
But Melt Everyone is really good as well.
That can be tomorrow.
So is Smooth Flow.
Lol new ArrayBuffer3*1024*1024*1024 crashes the tab in chrome.
Well it is a very big buffer.
I mean it shouldn't even attempt it.
But at least its crashes elegantly ?
<- this sketch perfectly articulates eveyrthing i hate about american tv.
Only missing the fucking between shots interviews.
While I love that sketch.
I have literally never seen a show that was like it.
And I watched CSI for years.
ChaosSmurf oh thats not for proper dramas or other 40 minute stuff.
MoonWolf so I just did that guildhest with te dogs that spawn blue fire when they die.
Its for the REALITY tv related shit.
We didn't kill a single dog.
Before the boss was dead.
GlennCuttlefish i thought you did it wrong.
Becuase those dogs keep spawning.
Technically we did it right since no blue flames were up.
The tank did die right before the boss so there was some chaos.
With 20 dogs still being up.
Yeah I don't watch reality tv because it's all uniformly total shit.
But it would instantly be half as shit.
If they stopped doing those things.
Wouldn't resonate with the key demographic tho.
Fuck the key demographic.
See it as this the key demographic brings in the money that lets you do other stuff.
Make more different horrible shows ?
Yeah I used to like that whole idea of making shit to let you make good stuff.
But you just end up making more shit.
So either you make the shit as good as you can.
Or you give up.
One of my co-workers is such a fucking moron.
Why did it have to be the one that lives in Glasgow.
Dude literally can't read between the fucking lines and he'sbeen doing this job longer than me.
It's no fucking wonder everyone thinks we're cunts.
Everyone as in readers or as in other journo people or games develoeprs.
Enjoy this cute video.
We as in games journos not our site particularlty.
I don't know if people think we're cunts.
There was a lot of ways that sentence could go.
So what sort of lines were there and what was in between them>.
Nobody is on mumble except anathema and he hates me.
Looks like they're off the boat.
Only took them 7 years to do so.
Well finally caught up to gravity falls again.
Now to wait for the finale.
Which is out as soon as...Next year.
Decided to start watching Acchi Kocchi. Surprisingly comfy 3.
Oh ok the price isn't actually down on the Blizzcon stuff.
Going to take out lenses and wipe off makeup first then yes.
Reading the quest text.
Implication is Sylvanas killed Varian.
And she's apparently the Warlord now vOv.
I 100% thought he was going to die and she would res him.
For a glorious couple seconds.
Noelor I thought something significant was going to happen.
These new kobald models.
This whole combat.
I know... I know I've let you down...
SunTiger name a profession please.
Is that a lumberjack?
Its someone who manages a forst.
Sometimes that might include cutting down a tree.
But thats not the job.
These dogs are hype about bathtime.
Finally finished RE4 Pic certainly NSFW.
Still an amazing game.
!note MairBear -> FE12 is one hell of a drug.
Todays improvised meal turned out rather well.
Fried some minced beef onions and garlic on the pan seasoned them with cinnamon and cumin added a vegetable assortment I found in the freezer I think its peas corn cauliflower and maybe something else? poured a can of crushed tomatoes on top of those and then mixed it all with some pasta.
SunTiger and GlennCuttlefish we wanting to murder creatures?
I could murder some creatures.
Mair gimme a minute.
I had forgotten how much you also miss by making a low int character in FO2.
Your playing FO2 ?
I hope thats too buggy on modern machines.
My gog version hasn't had any problems so far.
Yeah the GoG and Steam versions should work fine on never machines.
But i'll go have a quick smoke and then I can fantasy in final manner mair SunTiger.
Getting mad at commentators misgendering the Iron Knuckle.
SunTiger what/where's an Orsinium?
Orisinium has moved around a bit because it gets destroyed refounded a few times.
But its currently in the mountains of high rock.
Close to the skyrim border.
Not sure exactly where.
I'd have to look up a map.
Jade Empire is currently ~€3 on Steam.
Its a pretty good game well worth that price.
Also Black Mesa's half price.
So I've actually bought things this sale.
The heroes sale is likely to snipe me.
Sweet Jesus the Dungeon Siege movie is Bad.
Well tomorrow I'm going to stream the BloodRayne movies to friends. It has decided we shall all bring booze.
Today I learned there are THREE BloodRayne movies.
These are dull as shit.
ChaosSmurf remember when i said artifacts were just the old talent trees back again.
They are in fact WORSE.
They're like the old ones but with more powerful effects.
For roles that aren't tank.
And I guess wider rather than deeper.
Apparently one of the DK ones is all of your attacks have a chance to summon army of the dead.
Also you will end up with literally every single point available.
By X weeks into the expansion.
Based on what they've said.
Long grind to get all of them.
And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Our Dead hell of a talent name.
Bah all mage artifacts are staffs.
No weapon choice for you nerd.
Spriests get a dagger.
Afflocks get a cool scythe.
So today I left my badge to get into work and my phone at home go me.
Must be a friday.
Legion artefacts sound like GW2 Masteries.
But with things that actually affect your fighting ability.
Rather than 'you automatically loot things' and 'you can use bouncing mushrooms'.
Noelor that scythe is rad as hell.
ChaosSmurf PS AYWKUBTTOOD is the entry talent on that UH DK sword.
Well I'm looking forward to either the revamp on tanking artifacts or not playing a tank.
Entry talent on arcane mage gives me The power of Aegwynn.
>chaossmurf not playing a tank.
My world is torn asunder.
Have you seen the entry talent for frost DK Noelor.
Anathema they look so shit compared to the various new specs.
Man those artefact trees are boring as fuck.
The shaman ones looked cool.
Lots of unique effects.
A lot of them still look like fite 7% better.
Ok so yeah arcane mages get Medivh's mum's staff and channel the power of the Guardian of Tirisfal.
I am O.K. with this.
I would have respecced for a spellblade though.
You know what they should have made combat ?
I don't think anyone who rolled rogue wants spells is the thing.
Isn't that basically what it is.
Nah they just have a pistol.
Like instead of spells it's guns.
But it's still like whoa magic.
Subtlety are so good at sneak they have shadow magic.
Are we all gonna do the obligatory play the newest WoW xpac for a month with Legion?
At least me/noelor/mair are.
Expect it won't be hard to bully SunTiger in.
I guess if I reroll I could go elsewhere.
But I assume people would rather play their characters from last time.
And I have faith that I won't actually want to reroll.
Ok guess I'll faction change my warrior.
Even if I stick to Arms?
It's v. possible everyone will MMO-burn themselves out on FF14 tho and won't want to play by the time Legion comes out.
Which would be sad because I really enjoyed playing WoD with you guys.
You can do what you like mate.
I mean Arms is lame and Fury is traitorous.
But it's your choice *points*.
I just wanna transmog all my weapons into the Arcanite Ripper.
Leave the past behind friend.
Also remember that all your weapons is now one.
They should have disallowed transmog on artifacts.
Fuck you we worked hard on this art.
What does the arms one look like?
I don't know if its been spoiled yet.
Some Blizzard correspondant you are.
I am 95% sure it hasn't been spoiled yet.
Anathema a big sword I think.
Because Blizzard fucking love swords.
Mages only get staves.
Kirisu yeah but I mean it probably looks like ass.
Anathema it'll look a bit like the background of.
It'll probably look like ass.
Like all that other blizzard weapon art.
Like most of them yeah.
Don't compare to.
So good omg.
I wish I had the imagination to come up with thist stuff.
WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR IDEAS ANATHEMA?
>ChaosSmurf getting defensive over Blizzard.
GlennCuttlefish are you alive at present?
I think you need to look up the definition of defensive.
You linked a thing saying all the GW2 greatsword designs were great.
I spent one minute looking at them and saying they aren't.
Soz your game is trash.
Some of those are rad af though smurf.
Its better i motion.
They certainly have googled anime swords.
>criticising GW2 for anime swords.
Ashbringer isn't made of rainbows.
Cooked_Auto what's that video editing software.
That's not very good.
WoW weapons are also really wide its weird.
The ones you just linked are as big as that woman's torso.
I mean on the blade.
I assume that's just because their engine is blocky as fuck and ten years old.
Dagger art is the punishment for playing rogues tbh.
A blade the size of a dwarf is no longer a dagger.
The spell daggers are worse imo.
They always have ludicrous handles.
That's why mages have high int so they know how to hold a spell dagger without injuring themselves.
You know thinking about it loot is very weird.
Why does putting on this hat make me smarter.
So you have areason to do raids.
Its all about giving people a sense of progression.
So they don't realise they're pressing the same 5 buttons four thousand times a day.
ChaosSmurf There are plenty of those need more specifics.
Begins with a V or something.
A mate wants to turn an avi into an mp4.
And I remember doing it with some video editing software.
I've no idea why.
Ffmpeg can do that.
I will tell him ty.
Thats what I used to convert videos to mp4s.
ChaosSmurf should literally be 'ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.avi' IIRC.
MairBear I am now. Whats up?
SunTiger btw something you said during OtS this week will prove prescient in tonight's exalted game.
I say a lot of things ?
But I want you to know I put the Roll20 stuff together over a week ago.
I'm mostly just confused now!
Our roll-bads aside I thought that was a fun and good encounter.
You'll understand when you see it.
One of the early Frost mage artifact talents is Let It Go.
It is a tiny %age upgrade to Ice Lance's crit multiplier.
A lot of these are that sort of thing.
I might regret what I said earlier.
Entry talent of the Fire artifact is called Highblade's Will.
If fire gets the sword...
Also there's a talent in this artifact called By Fire be Purged.
Fireballs now dispel magic buffs.
Somebody just sent me a video of what the non-westernised version of Blade Soul looked like.
Video game artists in China have never seen a real woman move.
Minister that is a fantastic name and effect combo.
Do you get a talent name Die Insects ?
SunTiger tjat spimds more warlock.
NCSoft are doing the port actually.
Been out in China etc for a while.
Boobs 'n' butts aplenty.
It's not Scarlet Blade but how could anything be.
It takes a special kind of cynical exploitation of both women and nerds to create scarlet blade.
That goes far beyond just putting tits and ass in your game.
So apparently you'll be able to improve the artifacts to add more ranks to the 3-rank talents.
So for example Blink can have its cooldown reduced by 12 seconds.
Which I think means it would be 0.
ChaosSmurf yes that is a thing.
But I don't know if you'll be able to attack any that high.
Blink is 12s though yes.
The one for reduced cast time on fireball is called Fire at Will.
They've got the naming down even if the effects are dull.
Butts stack overflow.
Not friendly in the interpersonal sense though.
*sigh* Getting somewhat tired of my explorer.exe crash issue by now /.
I've pinpointed the issue but I can't figure out what to do to fix it.
Short of reinstalling windows entierly.
I guess reinstalling is in your future.
In this case its C\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft.vc90.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.30729.6161_none_08e61857a83bc251\MSVCR90.dll that keeps faulting.
And it does that by sheer random as well which is extra frustrating.
Anathema> butts stack overflow <- buttstack overflow sounds fine.
Balance druids get the Scythe of fuckin' Elune?
That is so rad.
There's something linking to that in the flavour text for one of the feral 100 talents.
Casting Starsurge summons the spirit of Goldrinn who BITES THE TARGET'S SOUL emphasis mine.
Gives a new cat form with flat +5% vers and has saberon-y appearance then the chat goes didn't we learn anything from scythe of elune!
See it all the time in pvp and it's irritating as sin just dull replacing class flavour like that with a simple passive.
Yup here we are.
Swordmages are fire spec.
Maybe fire'll be good in Legion.
Well the choices are one wields Kael'thas' sword one wields something from the council of six and one wields Medivh's mom's statstick.
I can't even remember what the council of six is.
But I guess that's Ebonchill.
Stuff from the council is six is legit.
Leaders of the kirin tor in dalaran.
Since thts stuff that players conceivably know about.
With the most fluctuating of composition.
As opposed to something nobody heard about before.
I know what the Kirin Tor are.
Figured they had a council.
Which is a big nono as far as i'm concerned for legendary items.
Did not know it was 6.
Certainly haven't heard of Alodi.
I read a book okay.
They were in a rhodin book.
I'm upset Arcane gets a staff but if I'm getting a staff that is a staff I want.
It's been 6 but when they've been in it's never clear which 6 were in at any one time.
Pretty sure khadgar and jaina are in it at the moment.
Don't knwo about the rest.
Alodi was a half-elven mage and the first Guardian of Tirisfal oh ok.
Rhonin was on it before he died.
Sylvanas' sister Rhonin's missus.
I'm not sure whether Khadgar is there's a point in WoD he refers to them in third person as if he's a bit outside the circle.
They should have included weapons from keal'thas' council fight as well.
But for Legion he's coming back in the fold and Jaina's being replaced at the helm.
Here's your artifact it will decay in 15 mins.
Return to tempest keep to refresh duration.
BwaS they were cool though.
I realize most poele never did thoes fights.
And a lot of them don't know about those artifacts.
And they are cool.
And they would not be new inventions.
Most of the model files were existing assets like glad gear.
Yeah well they can just reinvent new models.
I ran TK... until I got Ashes.
Its their raid powers that make them cool.
Ok well just based on those three for mages.
It's a mixture of established items from the EU.
And weapons attributed to important NPCs.
And a handful of artifacts pre-existing in WoW.
And the ~Scythe of Elune~.
Seriously that one is the most hype imo.
You turn into a worgen.
That had best be part of the quest to get/master it.
Who gets it ?
Cats get fangs technically daggers Bears get Claws fists.
All those funky druid forms ChaosSmurf's been linking?
Those claws better show up on the new models.
Effects of wielding the artifacts.
...the Claws of Ursoc have a talent called Ion Cannon.
It auto casts moonfire s?
Grants rage when Moonfire expires.
Which sounds weird to me but WiP.
I'd have prefered it if it fire a moonfire on an event.
Not an event after a moonfire.
That makes no sense for that name.
Thar She Blows Harpoon's cooldown is reset when you kill OR DISENGAGE.
Survival hunters = yoyo hunters!

The survival talent that improves pet damage by X% is currently called Fluffy Go!
They added Unleash the Hounds as an artifactalent.
It increases the number of beasts one of your spells summons.
Also this gun has a weird entry talent.
When you use Call Pet a permanent companion is summoned to fight for you Yes Blizzard that is what I would expect.
Noelor have you been trying to message me via my dad?
I mean my phones doesn't work.
Because that's the number I have for you.
But he's confused about ping.
It is the number you gave me.
I'm saying this is your fault okay.
It is it is.
Because I did actually think Maybe this isn't his number any more.
Well it's my network provider too they don't actually work in this hosue so my phone is dead at home I mean.
Except you gave me it in September this year so.
He just thougth for some reason I was the one telling him ping.
It is the better way to contact me if needed but yeah hi!
Just waiting on Ana.
Also over 10 minutes.
Topic made me think I was on time still -.
For another 10 minutes.
No I mean we're still 10 minutes before start.
So I saw Clannad on Steam y'day.

MoonWolf Have some amusing reading.
Let's just say the end is not what you expect.
>orcs are eldritch heritage in PF.
Noelor got a problem with this ?
Cooked_Auto fucking nukes chtulu with a boat across the galaxy.
I think it's a littel discriminatory tbh.
Noelor the other races do it too.
So... all heritage is eldritch?
You have an eldritch heritage it lets you do you race-ish things.
So it works like this.
If you are a sorcerer you have magic that is innate.
Thus you express magic that looks like the sort of thing your race would do.
Those are called bloodline powers.
You can use eldritch heritage to have bloodline powers from other races.

Mfw this lady cleans more than I deadlift.
Clean your own weights ana you misogynist /.
Oh ok its 80kg apparantly so not /more/ than I deadlift but waaaay more than I can clean FOR NOW!
I'm just taking pleasure in imagining the nerds in comments saying stuff like lol dudebro in the background just lifting a bar.
I know it's warmup.
I do not expect such expertise of a comments section.
S/clean/snatch/ got my lift the wrong way around.
I wonder if Mair's around.
Stew is cooking now I just gotta tidy the house s.
Noelor mair was doing a dungeon.
Anathema don't suppose you're able to commit to the 11th already?
Noelor I sure can.
Anathema btw I've already been secretly tracking Solar xp.
Man I'm getting good at scrounging up 40k bitz all of a sudden.
I had a guy in an electronics lab 'out' me as someone who used to play 40k for my lingo of 'sprues' and 'bitz' to refer to IC's and resistors.
So far Ive scrounged up enough stuff for 14 marines I just need to buy legs and some arms.
It's pretty yay for both of the K's.
Who spent the first proper session solving problems with sharp things.
Pointing them toward Dawn pretty effectively.
The dawn one is really easy!
So far Karuyo has accrued xp for both dawn and zenith actions Tuscatsi for zenith and twilight.
And Kudrani for dawn and night.
Now i'm just curious what i did was twilight worthy.
Man I'd hate to be that demon.
Screw you g-tekketsu I came here for giant robots beating the crap out of eachother not a thesis on adolescent illiteracy.
Prepare to continue to be dispaointed.
Deep thinker indeed.
Noelor that is fucking brilliant.
Noelor also if it changes your decisions for things I'm not sure if I'm aiming for Dawn or Zenith yet.
Well that was my christmas shopping done. Turns out my usual bookstore had a Black Friday offer still going so I got 11eu off my books.
My exalted player just said the words that crafting system looks interesting.
Bah. Seems we might actually play some today. No FF for me.
Now i'm just confused.

Noelor its a contest of personal might!
Otherwise I'd have taken Command!
Oh yeah I should do the thing.
Well. Starting setting is that the players are going to be leading an army against the empire.

The built in integer parser in fparsec doesn't fail to parse decimals it just ignores the decimal bit and returns the integer bit.
The top line of this is very depressing.
I could trivially replace it with a regex that then called int.parse but I'd rather not.
Yay I fixed it.
I have created over a thousand blades it turns out breaks the character limit.
So my password contains > now.
Which is p secure I suppose?
Not nearly as secure as just having a long one.
The active Test Run was aborted because the execution process exited unexpectedly fun times.

Hmm it parses Property=12 correctly but not Property<=12 I have no idea why S.
Or maybe I do...
Including every subtype of ascii.
Given it's in a locked building.
And the one across from it is Alexis11.
I have made up the number.
MoonWolf can you win a game of HS pls.
You were p. ballsy not healing that one turn.
But that matchup is close to unlosable.
I also fucked up.
I i fplayed azure drake and smited face.
Could have won one turn earlier.
And not lost to him drawing some damage.

I probably should to following Nez on my other account >_>.
Anathema you're going to Noelor's on the 28th right?
MairBear when are you going.
Noelor do you care when I arrive.
ChaosSmurf as early after boxing day as Noelor can stomach me.
I'll be visiting my grandparent who lives in Newc'l.
Sorting work shit out now.
I am gonna come with you on the 28th.
And will probably do some short shifts at work while I am at Noelor's.
Did that last line get through?
Nope your last line was at 1516 my time.
ChaosSmurf sounds fine I need to go to work 2 of the X days y'all are here.
!note MairBear Probably easiest for me if you show up on the same day as Anathemurf.
Nature is rad.
This compression isn't though.
This is not a picture of a lesbian somehow.
Look at my GPU it a puddle now.
I wish I had these people's work ethic.
This video is amazing.
Lets go with both.
I can tell becuase of the jaggies.
And some of the water?
It is a nice car though sure.

My whisky is flowing out of my eyes just one of those nights.
Why do you wake at this ungodly hour mair.
Great. its 6am and I have to visit the banks today to sort out this whole fight stick kerfuffle.
And I haven't slept yet.
You shoiuld try to do that more.
Are...Are YOU of all people lecturing me on sleep? 'm'.
Also wtf maintainence x.
Woo maintenance I can sleep in o/.
MairBear why is maintenance ?
Cos SE hates me.
But i need to gather things.
MoonWolf MC tech seems to be making a comeback to the meta? o.o.
New Jade Star LP.
MoonWolf latest update for visual studio finally has go to implementation.
Thank god for that.

Have you the news over the past few months about how mining companies are fucked because the price of metals has plummeted?
Thats not really a thin gi pay attention too.
Well its been in the news.
I don't doubt this fact.
Mining companies are fucked most of our customers are mining companies.
Not much you can do about that.
But the software we sell is like spefically for companies that mine / deal in the stuff you get from mining p.
You're alll fucked mate.
MoonWolf so not only is one of the first quests in F4 bugged out for me I can't open the console to fix it!
How did you even manage this.
Ah I got it it isn't the key next to 1 on UK keyboards in this one.
Its ' the key @ is on on UK keyboards.
They didn't hardcode it to the actual key location.
But to the actual keystroke.
Still annoyed the quest bugs!
Wasn't it ` before? not ' ?
Before = morrowind oblivion skyrim f3 fnv etc.
Pretty sure it was just whatever was next to one.
I mean that literally.
Regardless of the symbols.
MoonWolf you can code for receiving the button at 10?
For some reason I'm imagining scottish dinosaurs and giggling slighty.
Well ofc haven't you heard of the plesiosaur colony they've got.

Great 30 min bot game on heroes. Our comp triple support double warrior. Tass Tyrande Malf Sonya Stitches.
It didn't work out.
You were supposed to be invulnerable.
No punch basically malf was practically on auto follow or something.
Just poppped a survival manual.
In abuot an hour ?
GlennCuttlefish ready to go.
Secret Hitler is a pretty fun game.
Unless you forget to include Hitler.
In which case it's just very stressful =<.
Is that like that spy game without the spy ?
Is that like something mafia/werewolf-y?
No it's worse than that.
And also different to werewolf though closer to that ballpark.
I'll explain from a real keyboard though.
Anathema which is your train.
So Life is Strange LP.
Obviously YouTube suggests other LiS LPs in the related.
Including some dickhole who put the description of their episode ie spoilers as the video title.
I think Ive got a script running or something that removes recommendations.
I love the subtle jokes in this show.
Mu update the exalted date maybe ?
Anathema you say subtle.
Ok so Secret Hitler.
There are two teams fascists and liberals.
One of the fascists is Hitler.
All the fascists EXCEPT Hitler know the identities of each other and of Hitler.
Hitler and the liberals know nobody's identities.
Players take turns to be president nominating a chancellor who is voted upon - once a president/chancellor pair is voted in they pick up 3 random cards that say fascist or liberal and must between them choose one to add to the policy track.
Each party is trying to get enough of their policies passed to win.
But also the liberals are trying to kill Hitler.
And you can only kill Hitler by passing enough fascist policies.
Oh and if Hitler is elected chancellor in the late game the fascists win.
I was the last president of our final game tonight and knew I had a 50% chance of Hitler.
This was very stressful!
I propose a new variation on tis game accidentally hitler hitler doens't know he's hitler.
Only it turned out there was actually a 0% chance of Hitler because HITLER WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE DECK THAT GAME.
Anathema while i apreciate the companionship its a little weird that you keep joining mumble muted and deafened.
ChaosSmurf aye central 1500 Coach D Seat 52A.
MoonWolf will be my PC turning itself on.
Wtd happened to Google?
The search results are taking up am even smaller portion of the screen width than usual.
Great now you've made me paranoid about that because I hadn't even thought of it until now >|.
Wait untill it figures out how to howl.
Anathema when are you coming back.
I find it odd that Archer has created over a thousand blades.
Rather than ten thousand.
He being Japanese and all.
Or ten ten thousand.
ChaosSmurf I'm not going back to Glasgow going back to Cambridge after hogmanay.
Fuck I've lost my glasses.
It's called new year's btw.
You'll be a busy man.
What with having to cut everyone it seems.
Maybe people shouldn't be so vexxing.
MoonWolf that was fucking brutal.
MairBear its the change from lol murloc to pretending to be salty to actually just being salty as fuck.
It's been 4 days.
How can you not remember 4 days.
Its a pretty long period.
I can't even remember what i ate 4 days ago.
Oh bugger that was close.
I didn't level myself up to 8 yet x.
I wish to share this horrible nsfw-ish image with all of you.
It is not a thing that I get D.
It is a great combination of mprg crossover slash fourth wall breaking and weird american libertarian politics.
'great' is not the term I would use.
There cat is now level 8.
I can't remember if I levelled up lizard.
I'll have to check.
Holy moly they did it.
It actually funded ?
It was funded before I got to it this morning in fact.
Holy shit Outsider updated again! O.
Each update this year is a year without updates.
I'm running a little late btw.
Chopping veg now for frying.
I'm running late too.
Making too many fancy scamps.
How late are we talking here.
15 minutes? Because if so I can make slight alterations to my dinner plan.
Taking this silence as yes back in 10 minutes.
I was back on time.
Drawn and uploaded somewhere by an artist downloaded and consolidate onto another website then downloaded as one image *from that other rip website* to upload to imgur.
Because never link OC.
That's not how we internet.
Strange when I visited the Louvre da Vinci didn't leave behind paint samples to describe what colours he used for the Mona Lisa.
You used a red crayola to draw a fucking charmander? well no shit.
I love playing wizards when dice dont hate me.
Dob Da Vinci wasn't on tumblr.
Oh goodie we're going to war with the L part of ISIL to add to the I S and the I parts.
You're going to war with libya ?
L for 'Levant' Syria region.
I wouldn't call it a war more as Let's just chuck some bombs at these guys and then call it a job well done.
Meanwhile RN just looks on sadly on the sideline. Maybe next time guys. _.
Well they gotta wait until they've built Her Majesty's Ship Her Majesty and Her Majesty's Ship Her Son.
And gotten the planes for it v.
And trained the crew.
Maybe some day you'll have actually functional carriers again. Maybe.
At least you're not the Canadian Navy so you clap yourself on the shoulder there.
We have a single contiguous coast.
That image is fucking perfect.
Holy crap that's good.
!note MoonWolf I did the required primordial hard modes solo feel free to do those with mair or on your own if I'm not up.
Aw yiss Lego Left Shark.
Yueah I watched it this morning.
The bits where the men punch will be alright.
And I actually kinda like the first time Lex shows up in that.
But can imagine him being awful when he goes into Evil Mode.
Doomsday looks like a baby somebody dropped however and once again trailers are doing their best to spoil movies they're for.
Is that who that person made of crusty tar is supposed to be?
Still think Affleck will be fantastic tho.
Because he is fantastic.
And people who disagree should watch Gone Girl until they do agree.
Batman with a gun.
You know that hero.
Who has like one policy.
He's used so many guns in the comics.
And in every other film he's been in.
Usually they didn't fire actual bullets.
But w/e it's a new interpretation.
People are so stuck on the DC stuff I don't understand.
They are stuck on the new stuff because it seems needlessly grim and edgy.
Being a 90s throwback could be cool.
Man of Steel was pretty bad though.
Jessica Jones is darker than anything DC have ever done on a film screen.
Like by a factor of ten.
And that is one property.
The movies are one property.
DC's TV stuff is brighter than the sun.
Arrow is varied but Supergirl and Flash are basically comedies.
I should really watch the rest of Arrow and Flash.
Plus all the marvel shit is the same joss whedon quip-based pseudo-comedy.
I thought arrow was a soap opera ?
People just like that more for some reason.
In one big pot of sometimes shit.
The cw stuff is just.
I find their shows so difficult to describe.
In every direction that could be considered.
Unless you're not into it.
And also the first season is vital but garabge.
Rory back as time traveling English man.
That new trailer is everything I've ever wanted.
Except dunno about the savage casting.
He looks like a bit of a wang.
He should like scary and threatening and ooo terrifying.
Then again he is taking over London.
ChaosSmurf is Legion gonna have GW2-esque level scaling? o_0.
I was under the impression we'd already discussed it.
Yeah all the zones except the finalone scale from 100-110.
And all the non-heroic dungeons.
So you can do them in whatever order.
It's also fucking magic because a level 108 player partied with a level 103 player will see different health values on everything.
But get the same challenge from it all.
So people going to the old pre-Legion zones wont be downscaled?
Yeah it's just in the Legion zones.
I assume they will try to roll it out for Azeroth Northrend etc. eventually.
But probably not until the next expac or two.
What the /fuck/ is with 103 and 108 player seeing different numbers on the same target?
I start in stormheim on thursday.
And I get to level 103 finish the zone.
Then you show up at the weekend cause you're a nerd who has to work or whatever you're just 100.
We can both go to x zone and get the same experience partied together.
As for how it works I have no idea.
Combo of phasing tech and the PvP level scaling stuff.
Instead of downscaling players to the zone they scale monsters up to the players?
But a monster cna do an AoE that hits one person for 400 and one person for 700 because the players are different levels?
I think yes on both.
That is the stupidest possible implementaiton of that idea they could have done.
It's the one that involves the least playing with character power.
Barring the final zone from the get-go you can go to any zone and the monsters will be level 100?
I think there's 4.
And their plotlines don't go into each other but are linked I assume.
If a dungeon party consists of a 100 a 102 a 105 and a 110 they will each see the dungeon mobs as having level-approprate health dealing level-appropriate damage?
Will players do level-appropriate healing to each other?
Again I think yes on both.
But I've not read anything about healing and all they said about dungeons was they'd work the same way.
All the mobs also scale up to 110 so rare mobs in old zones have semi-relevant loot at 110.
Old zones = old zones in the expansion?
It's all Legion specific.
None of this is going back to a zone that isn't one of the 5-6 in Legion.
This sounds ludicrously complicated.
But simpler for the players.
Its going to break.
Remember when phasing in garrisons broke?
You mean the first week of the expansion.
I saw something yesterday that almost made me want to play wow when the expansion hits.
Fortunately I have forgotten what it was.
GlennCuddlefish was it my loving friendship.
I am mad I didn't get to tell that dude how great he was.
Or conduct some investigative journalism and thank him with an email or something p.
Is it arrow first or flash first.
So League of Exploreres next wing is out.
*seethes about in this day and age etc*.
The europeans were lax in their exploration then.
They found the new world and rested on their laurels.
This game D.
3 healer game on the new map.
Well guess I am not getting that stick today.
Delivery attempted recipient not home my ass.
Had a QM earlier on Cursed. Victory despite enemy team having a Cho'Gall w/o a mirror on our side.
Feels good taking CG down with a full dive ^^.
GlennCuddlefish just did Ultimate Ballad.
Omg it happened again.
Egh Tass can go pretty dps build on his own not much a straight support.
Anathema this isn't bed at al.
So there's this tool in the heroes community called 'hotslogs' upload your QM/ranked replays and it will estimate MMR for you.
The about status lists author Ben Barrett.
My god the Bloodrayne movies are awful.
Hmm turns out you can win a QM comp when you spawn in alongside CG Zera and Nova against a 'conventional' 1 war 3 ass 1 sup comp.
Took a bit of late game ramp though but was fun D.
Shit my twitter stream is nothing but CS tweets.
This is why we mute hashtags.
Site doesn't mute tags.
S'on you really innit?
I'm not sure i agree with you.
Got an invoice for the import tax on my Overwatch stuff.
Its a lot isn't it ?
Given the actual shipping was waived and I win on the exchange rate buying from the USA.
And now I'm off to work with Tracer's face on my torso!
Well the silhouette of her goggles and hair.
So not her face at all.
Juts the things on her face.
Code-reviewed new guys stuff yesterday said use .any instead of .count != 0' he only fixed the one instance I commented on not the others.
Be more clear next time.
Your face should be more clear next time |.
Proper brain scoop dissecting video.
Hydrations important even post mortem.
Did I somehow wake up before mair.
I just forgot IRC till now x.
Into the cube of shame with you.
I dont get it.
I get more commendations as BLM than as a tank.
So today I found a note in my mailbox.
Apparently the delivery man came by decided to not I dont know ring the doorbell OR knock.
And then drove off again just leaving me a note.
Never had that issue vOv.
So today I have to go on a wonderful little adventure to find their office.
Heck most delivery firm people CALL AHEAD even.
Oh let me tell you about their call ahead policy.
I received a text message around 730AM.
When I was still firmly in bed asking me what they should do with my stuff.
Only people who tend to show up unannounced is the mail people if they have a large package to deliver.
The deadline to answer this message? 830AM.
I did receive a message later asking me to send a message to the delivery guy.
So I know for a fact he had my number.
Cooked_Auto yeah regular mail does not get telephone data for the packages anyway.
Which brings me to my third point in earlier litany.
GlennCuddlefish I've had that happen. Hell when I was at Anathema's in cambridge we saw a delivery man come to the door we were standing behind post a you weren't in card. And wander off and as I recall he had no mail bag.
So I assume he just left it behind and took the lazy route ...
And fucking call him on that shit ?
Cos it wasn't my house xD.
MoonWolf Because doing that isn't briths.
You should know this.
Neither is being a fucky lazy ass who doesn't even try to deliver.
Steps of faith ?
But when I rodered a WoW collectors edition. I was waiting for it to arrive unable to play etc. I heard a knock at the door sprinted down the delivery guy had already got in his van and was half down the road and I gave furious chase...
But uh... turns out he knocked and just dumped the delivery in the porch.
Rather than leave a card.
Enjoy this duckling.
And now I'm in the new house if they knock and there's no reply they just leave it at the door because no one's gonna steal it or anything out here. Most likely problem a rabbit eats it.
That'll be a nice call to have.
In my case the delivery people tend to call ahead and say they're dropping something off or in some cases dad gives me an ahead warning since its usually stuff he's ordered. But after that they usually knock or use the doorbell. On the wrong door more often than not v.
Mailman left order of salad at the door rabbits ate it please refund or redeliver.
Well if we can 't steps of faith yet.
Going to go shower.
I'm ready to when glenn is.
MoonWolf dont have it unlocked.
MairBear I forgot about that bloody delivery drivers.
And I dont think I will unlock it before I have to leave. Run it without me if you want to progress I'll catch up tomorrow.
MoonWolf just spent 15 minutes on why isn't my thing for selecting the first result selecting the first result? maybe the results aren't sorted?
MoonWolf line was this.propertynewItems1this.valueProperty.
Anathema 0 indexed is hard.
Things that make glenn irrationally angry in the morning Having to refill the sugar dish.
Because more info about dinosaurs is always cool.
Any drama out of the not-VGX then?
Koniami are twats pretty much vOv.
Finally I can delete unwanted games.
Well they actively blocked Kojima from attending and recieve an award.
Finally I can delete unwanted games <- but why would you ?
To make it easier to find the games you do want.
Like I have all the shite from the Orange Box still that I got to play Portal and theoretically Half Life.
There are things I will literally never play.
But it has a seach ?
You have a search.
Do you not know about the view installed option ?
I mean when I'm looking for games to install them obviously.
Installed is my default view.
I think the list is currently 6 games long?
The longest it's been for a while.
I realized what its for.
Its to delete the porn vn's and huniepop.
Mine is 12 right now. Tend to keep it even because I use the big icons.
Or as the headliner image suggest FO4. P.
MoonWolf is furiously deleting all the Yuri VNs he has bought.
Must erase the shame.
The only vn's i have on steam are hate and hate+.
I still have an almost morbid curiosity in Hunie Pop.
And there is no way i'm deletin ga game that has a achievement you only get if you send the developer a picture of you eating a cake with your waifu.
Do you have that achievement though?
He probably does. He just doesnt want to admit.
He baked the cake aaaaall by himself.
I need to learn to make shortcrust.
There's mince pie competitions coming up.
<- xenoblade chronicles x actually lists the voice actors next to your voice type.
I forgot to go and look for good images of this week's Ex3 fights.
So it'll be pokÃ©mon again.
I was reminded of this because my phone's music shuffle just put on the Anistar City theme.
Which is fantastic and I recommend a listen even if you never pokÃ©mon.
MoonWolf I think it's brilliant.
I will withold comment.
So if / when Minister finishes his Exalted game would people be interested in a Bulwark 2 ?
I'll have to find another character to play.
MoonWolf the JAIDS has struck again.
Not even a new computer could contain it.
Nah this time its videos fucking up.
DS3 looks really nice.
Not even at the christmas party yuet and I'm shaking with anxiety.
My work Xmas party will be 3 people \o/.
This is a free meal I mostly want to meet the edinburgh guys I've frequently talked to but never seen.
Also did I mention the free meal.
My work Xmas party will be 3 people \o/ <- small work.
MoonWolf my team at work now is... 7.
Most of the m don't want to dine ?
Team leaders go to a separate do one guy is going with another team he's sort-of post of.
The two 40+ ladies don't want to go out for a meal with work.
And of those three only one not me the younger one would have wanted to go out without the company paying the bill.
Anyway because it's only 3 we're going for Japanese food.
So I've sent my brother a message asking which Japanese drinks I actually like.
Asahi. Probably. As that's the only japanese drink I know of.
MoonWolf> enjoy this duckling <- this duck's down looks like a roast potato.
I ... guess ?
Telltale are making a Batman game well then.
Telltale are making an everything game.
I'm sure they've got the method down pat by now since they're very similar p.
Modern vibrators described as Not powered the same way as trains.
Depends on the kind of train.
I mean the transfer is different but electric trains are defs a thing.
Not powered on the same scale as trains.
She was holding a wired one though!
Pantographs aren't a wired connection.
I find it amusing that they're called that given the conversation.
Would like to see a vibrator going as fast as a shinkansen mind.
Cooked_Auto oh god what did you do.
Did you tweet all your youtube videos. in a row ?
Automatic as I put them to public instead of unlisted.
Didnt realize it until I checked tweetdeck.
That sure is a roegadyn.
Well finishing undertale took longer than I expected.
Because You thought you were done? Hah! or because you played again?
I think playing again with his group?
Replaying it with group yes.
Also got my stick.
Stick working confirmed time to catch up in FF.
I just cleared steps.
1 supernal ability must have at least one dot recommend 5.
4 other caste abilities.
5 favoured abilities each must have at least 1 dot.
+2 attribute dots in primary category.
+2 attribute dots in secondary category.
+1 attribute dot in tertiary category.
Spend 6bp on not-charm stuff.
Anathema I added a handout to the Roll20 game about upgrading to Solars that you should please read and act upon before next week's session.
Omg the Rag Christmas quote.
Ragnaros - WINTER SHOULD BE WARMER!
Jaina stop dying so much screw you tassadar you have the same death count.
Mairbear its happening again.
Yes the article is three years old but still doesnt make it less amazing.
I'd call this 100% accurate.
Shots from the Pokemon Product Approval Manual.
MairBear i did it i did the thing.
I got to 60 before even getting into HW.
MoonWolf did you get to the night of 1000 cutscenes yet? X.
Grabbing tea and hopping to mumble for this ride.
While its a nice idea smooth criminal just doesn't work without that proper bass.
Fucking irn-bru now I want some.
But I cant get any until monday at which point the craving has passed.
I'll link you more adverts on Monday then.
GlennCuddlefish will you be roulette with us at any point this day?
Sure want one right now or?
Well that was certainly a question of time.
Anathema I linked that like 5 lines ago.
Final Fantasy VII is a bigass game they've got plenty of space to fuck things up still. truth.
Ruby and Emerald Weapon are DLC.
So are Yuffie and Vincint.
<- that place must smell great.
Oh wait no the other one.
I need that mod the next time I install W3.
So you know how all WoW expansions rebalance warrior rage?
Just about every Path of Exile content update rebalances life leech.
Leech balance is important.
Also Talisman league sounds great.
I prefer my leagues talisman-free.
But I can appreciate that you may enjoy it.
Of course it starts dec 11th.
9 days before I go on holiday.
The international day of talisman.
Anathema they clearly need it.
These men are happy about a rocket.
But basically I was making caramel was whisking it like you're supposed to threw in the butter and it bubbled up like crazy so much that I didn't have time to take out my hand before it got me and I burnt the tips of all my fingers except my thumb and like half of my palm on the left side. *Inward hiss of sympathetic pain.
Like liquid lava over your hand.
At my flcs there are a bunch of stuffed toys of Artemis.
Who is the white cat from Sailor Moon.
I can only assume that they had a bunch of Lunas Lunae? too and that nobody actually wants Artemis.
I think I may have seen some Luna in there.
GlennCuddlefish When you see it.
Just about every Path of Exile content update rebalances life leech <- life leech is a fucking mistake in a diablo game.
D3 did it right when they moved to life on hit.
Well they want to drain their playerbase completely.
MoonWolf PoE has leech AND life on hit!
And one of those is so nice it has to be rebalanced every major patch!
There are caps on % of max hp you can recover per second and on the number of targets leech can be applied to per attack I think that might have gotten removed when they cut the leech % in 1/5.
Life leech is so easy to balance we have 2 additional rules associated with it.
There are lots of traits that modify either your % life leeched or your max health % healed per second.
I played a leech-based maruader last league!
They haven't yet said what factor of leech they are rebalancing in 2.1.0 they aren't releasing full patch notes until a couple of days before the content release so the weekend I guess.
Wish I didn't have a mac so I could buy a laptop capable of running games |.
No PoE on mac ?
Even if there is a mac client I don't think there is my 2012 mac air does not have a gaming capable GPU.
It managed about 20-30fps in D3 on lowest settings but got dangerously warm.
Literally cannot play dota2 on lowest.
Like not just low FPS.
I wanna play PoE |.
Basically I need a wee windows box I can stream games to the mac from p.
Isn' there a service that just basically does that.
But over the internet.
Does that still exist?
Sony has acquired important parts of OnLive. Due to the sale all OnLive services were discontinued as of April 30 2015.
Did sony buy it out for console related game streaming ?
Huh leech is getting buffed.
Hahaha as expected flame totem got an early game nerf.
Were they not being used by everyone to just do leveling untill their actual build got online ?
Oh look the continuing adventures of a univeral mana resource is terrible game design.
MoonWolf they were really strong so yeah *everyone* leveling with a flametotem.
Jade Empire is free on Origin right now.
Plume is displaying 200+ unread tweets.
P sure this'll be ChaosSmurf's fault.
There was a fighting game tournament.
Minister ofc it is.
I'm reading my tutor's feedback on something I wrote in October.
About a pirate witch.
We had to include a summary of how we wrote the thing.
And one of her notes in that summary is wooing the lines of how did you come up with the idea of a female pirate?
And I'm just sat here like... what?
Time for a history lesson!
Seriously there is some amazing women pirates wirates ? of history.
Like the chinese one who went to war with the army and fucking won.
I have also been criticised for using the word rune in a story with pirates which I don't even.
MoonWolf play nefarian vs paladin.
Get Anyfin can Happen.
Also lost marks because I wrote it in Open Office and the formatting got fucked when it was opened in Word =<.
MairBear ANYFIN can happen.
As lon gas you played at least 7 murlocs this game.
Didn't get to test but does it just summon 7 tinyfins if no murlocs died?
Or does it eat 10 mana.
Wuldn't be suprised if it just eats 10 mana.
Sounds like a bunch of English people wish they were Dutch today.
Also it turns out the mince pie competition I thought was coming up was today.
Ie basically 0 notice.
Whats this about being dutch ?
Lot of flooding over the weekend.
20cm of rain in some places over like 1 day.
You're going to need some pumps.
Watched a Kevin Bridges dvd with a non-native english speaker last night had to do some translating.
Coworker just opened PR #999.
That's nice and all.
Think you'll find it's Tracemaker.
Get out of here with your hate-ships =/.
You're on the canon ground / I'm up in crack-ship space.
You can actually view all the previous avatars a person has had by opening their newest one and just replacing the 0003 or whatever on the end of the URL with a lower number huh.
The k/d/a change to Heroes with the last patch has really demoralised me.
Like I often have a low D part but my K is just abysmal.
Not sure if it's just killstealing Novae from this free week.
A is just as valuable!
You should always have A>K.
Or you're the KSing arsehole.
Thanks for the confidence boost.
Just wondering if my play's a little a too timid for its own good.
Folks were asking yesterday when you're headed down under.
Departing 16th back in uk 30th.
K I think they might drop a card round yours for your mum then.
Also I got a xmas cake from sue.
It is a Proper British Christmas Cake.
Ie a 3kg cake that's about 10cm in radius.
Also turns out my mum got me an advent calendar even though I've moved out.
I wish I could afford a chocolate calendar.
Zar.Va is a way better name.
I am really looking forward to thsoe animated shorts.
Cooked_Auto what even slightly.
I have conflicted feelings about shipping Zarya incidentally.
Do you think she is asexual.
Because I want everyone to be lesbians just as a matter of course.
Straight ships are for gays tbh.
But I don't want her to be a lesbian just because she's able to lift any other character.
D.Va can probably lift her.
CA linked a Bastion/D.Va's mech comic at some point... last week I think?
That is 100% how she would react.
Yeah there you go.
I don't think Bastion is the bitch type tho.
Noelor do you have any idea how mad I am about FF7 being one game in three parts.
Is that seriously what's happened.
Three is the go to number cause 3 discs.
I've only been on the periphery of FF7 stuff via the SA thread.
And the implication from their multi-part series stuff ios that it will be multiple full games.
That is basically FF7 megathread while Elentor's putting the epilogue together.
So they can make it hyper-detailed.
Has he beat Safer now then.
So they can get anything at all out ny 2017.
I think that's the joke yeah.
I'm not mad about it.
I'm mad about defending it for ten more years.
So much enjoyable salt.
Maybe I can just macro worked for SC2 to a button.
And yeah he's beaten dramatic organ music.
Might read it when it's on the archive.
How long is that now then.
He started it before I moved to Glasgow.
That's the date on OP.
Maybe mixing in my head with whatsisname's.
Who did ff8 and wasno't very good.
There's a new FF8 ongoing.
MoonWolf oh I was going to ask.
Noticed the thread was killed.
How far did they get?
OP does not have LP time in life anymore.
The preamble to disc 2 was just cleared up.
I think 9 will be the new golden sun.
Especially for a jrpg I guess.
There's 4 solid hours of talking at the start of disc 3.
And by 4 solid hours of talking I mean even in the speedruns it takes one and a half at least.
Anathema Wedge sounds like badger from breaking bad.
Those sure are some anime tits.
Nomura noted rabbit-hole diver what does this even mean.
He goes off the deep end.
Most likely in reference to Kingdom Hearts.
Currently trending on british facebook #YouAintNoMuslimBruv.
Noelor>> did you see this one?
I don't watch or read the news so no!
<< oh the irony.
Line one is actually new to me.
Noelor my blizzard stuff arrived.
The box is gr8.
I can't remember if you were around when I said.
But I ended up with a £25 invoice for import tax from FedEx.
About a week after my box.
How much stuff did you get.
Magnets a few tops.
The goal was to make the climate more trans-friendly but it was widely mistaken for a change in university policy. Some of the press coverage imagined that he and she were being outlawed Tennessee!
This is cute.
Yes let's call it that.
If you don't want to... you never have to see that *humiliating* death again thanks Kaplan.
I feel better about dying now you've phrased it like that.
Man imagine if heroes played you a replay during your death timer as well...
Well it'd be more like if when you died you and only you got perfect vision of a radius around your corpse for a few seconds.
Hard to parse into the same terms.
MoonWolf Ashley having once kicked a soccer ball at a griffin is bound to be a person worth getting to know better.
Ah yeh tru dat.
See even Dob agrees and he has zero context.
Not going to lie I'm somewhat hyped for that.
I'm glad that Street Fighter has hair drills dohoho.
It's an important fighting style.
What would we do without hairdrill no jutsu.
Otoh R Mika and a lady I assume to be her tag team partner grabbed an enemy between their buttocks in order to slam him into the ground.
Noelor I know it's the perfect voice!
I deadlifted 100kg today!
Are you now officially ripped ?
Not with a 2pl8 diddylift I'm sitll dyel by /fit/ standards.
My 'ripped' target is squatting 100kg pressing 60kg benching 80kg.
Great I'm now having a Twitter conservation with a bus company.
I tweeted some incredulity last night.
About how late a bus was?
A sequence of buses were so late I saw 4 of the same service back-to-back.
The hell is up with my autocorrect today.
Minister are you expecting Exalted to run on the 18th?
GlennCuddlefish One of these things.
Is not like the others.
Nah the lack of Black Mage when he's in a level 51 dungeon...
Despite knowing about jobs and having the requisite.
Took em long enough.
MoonWolf's secret shelf.
Well XRD finally coming to steam.
I might actually buy it. IF IT HAS LOBBIES.
Oh hey OW stuff I don't have favourited.
RaF coming to HotS.
I erm don't think I have any friends left to convert.
Don't look at me. I don't want to play it p.
It's real and great.
You're not my friend p.
I'm fine with that.
Disappointed in the lack of Nero on those Saber shelves.
I was just thinking to myself Stand Still Stay Silent wasn't creepy enough lately.
It was more visceral this time than creepy.
But i guess we needed mroe crepy ?
And found this creepy.
ChaosSmurf I don't suppose you'd know if this year's Batgirl was any good?
I looked this up on YouTube because my alchemicals group skype conversation turned to the subject of FF7 and it got stuck in my head anyway.
One of the suggested playlists is Final Fantasy Sad Songs.
And the first video on that playlist based on the thumbnail is from... FFX-2.
Noelor ... the comic? no.
Do you Mercy at all?
Prefer zen or symm.
It was converted from C to C++.
Dunno how I managed to reply in the wrong channel.
Cooked Maids With Guns Auto.
Deal w/ it >|.
PoE patchnotes went out today D.
A short instance-wide cooldown has been added to many monster skills. Monsters with bursty skills have had this cooldown applied to reduce player deaths from fast hard-to-predict damage. This includes skills such as Leap Slam Flicker Strike Shield Charge Lightning Warp and Arctic Breath. Most of the affected skills are appropriate as initiation skills but are not ideal when many monsters perform them simultaneously.
Oh I was mistaken.
Only one maid had a gun.
Deal with it still.
Sungalsses in winter? You loon.
Makes sense to me. Snowblindness sucks.
MairBear the Sun is low bright and harsh.
.... you win this round...
Torchoak Grove the unique Vakali Totem from Kaom's Dream has had a variety of bug fixes and reductions to damage in order to reduce his unreasonable lethality. good fuck that guy.
More like casual of exile.
They also halved the life of the unique guy who summons a million clones of himself which teleports him because it is clone-arrow.
He was a pain.
In other news some users recently learnt a harsh lesson about running third-party cheating tools Don't.
Only run high quality first party cheating tools.
They added the last Goddess sword O.
Bound -> Scorned -> Unleashed.
Turn The Other Cheek A set of three can be redeemed for a Corrupted Pacifism Unique Jewel.
Pacifism is a jewel that has one mod -1 max frenzy charges.
I'm guessing it will be involved in a recipe somewhere.
Enemies can be redeemed for a corrupted Unique Wand.
Its a wow patch note.
Anathema PoE the other one is getting Casual Mode.
Pillars of Eternity more like Casuals of Eternity.
641 pages on that FF7 thread eh.
ChaosSmurf have they announced anything else about the remake?
Do you know it's going to be in parts.
Only in the vaguest it will be in parts sense.
The general consensus now is that it will be a 13-style Trilogy.
My guess would be a game per disc.
So midgar up to Aeris death game 1 get to explore that whole continent.
Then aeris death to crater game 2 get to explore the world.
Then a massively expanded version of the crate for game 3 along with all the side stuff that only unlocked in disc 3 in the original.
But their PR on it has been bad and scattered so nobody knows for sure.
It isn't a Telltale-style episodic thing tho it's x full games.
Midgar to aeris' death is a good 20+ hours IIRC.
It's also possible they'll just make Midgar massively longer and have that as game 1.
Aeris dies at end of game 2.
Then game 3 is the rest of the game less expanded.
Or it'll be more than 3 games but that seems unlikely.
I might wait until they are all out then unless I have a PS4 for some other reason by then.
I would expect the first in 2017 or early 2018.
So they won't be done until I am 30.
I saw that now wait and see what I do when it is actually released...
I found a bug in our old filter parser that has existed for years and no-one else has reported!
I am unclear on why you would be hype about this.
I really liked that book its being directed by steven spielburg.
ChaosSmurf has parts rather than episodes been confirmed though?
It sounds like Squeenix's PR team is worse than Onyx Path's.
Onyx path doesn't HAVE anyone.
MoonWolf I'm learning to be a better Dark Knight....
By talking to a moogle.
It's simple brood more.
Is the moogle supposed to awaken your inner darnkess with annoyance ?
Dancing has everything to do with the dark arts!
Oh lordie lord the titles.
So I promised to lend my friend one of my old MP3 players until he gets his own back.
There's still some of my music there. I think I'll replace every single one of those tracks with renamed Never gonna give you up.
Thats way to much effort for me.
Why even format it.
But what's the fun in that?
You need at least one instance of Saftey Dance in there too.
End result? The DARKNESS is powered by love.
Love makes you darker.
Love for girls that are being murdered by their mother ?
The talents of three of the world’s greatest storytellers – Roald Dahl Walt Disney and Steven Spielberg I mean it's probably pushing it more than a little to suggest all of these people are involved in this project.
So who is going to be late because of dinner today?
Just finished my katsu.
Guessing some animÃ© dish.
Well not me since I havent even started on lunch.
Damn wrong program entirely.
Why do I do this.
Why do I keep playing 100% OJ.
That is all about luck in virtual dice.
Well moonwolf is going to be half an hour late so dinner o/.
MairBear what's the two kana before gojira^?
Title is Shin Godzilla/Godzilla Resurgence.
Shin looks right sure.
Someone remind me tomorrow night to Exalt.
Windup ifrit is 'dorbs.
Im surprised how well this works.
Well I managed to fix the playlist issue i had by just remaking the playlist window. vOv.
I hadn't noticed the new topic.
Wtd is it even?
The US justice system is a beautiful thing.
Noelor its a tales game thing.
Yeah that makes sense.
Can't stop listening to A Tout Le Monde atm such a good song.
Bah have to use a regex parser.
Was hoping not to.
'I just installed a new SSD I bought during Cyber Monday... Path of Exile took 236 less seconds to start up. It now takes 4 seconds total. '.
How goes the pre-exalting?
Bird people are talking weird to me Minister.
!note MairBear.
!note MairBear XCOM 2 FOOTAGE.
Looks like a pretty good game to me.
Arm rockets = good game.
Yeah I can get with that.
Anathema ice rock or steel?
<- digital XCOM 2 ChaosSmurf.
That's how I got Barrett killed. Death by snake hug. What a way to go.
He was killed by a viper in the pcgamesn article.
The soldier named after him anyway.
MoonWolf more new heroes in Darkest Dungeon still no 'darkest dungeon' level.
MairBear too busy watching xcom 2 to DD.
Also I need to do some chores and take a bath but I should have time to do the duty roulette before my class.
Im unsure what you are ?-ing.
Oops didn't tab enough.
MairBear guess you'll miss this.
Anathema just pick one thematically so I can make pogs for tomorrow.
Inb4 you doomed us all.
If you see me on Steam playing Fallout in 2 or 3 hours please yell at me to Exalt I might forget.
Guess I have to watch it then.
Sorry but Community is literally the best sitcom of all time.
So good _.
MoonWolf> bird people are talking weird to me Minister <- wait what?
Exactly what i said.
*will have that in head all evening again*.
Noelor i was doing ff14 quests for bird people.
They have a talking gimmick.
Was I pinged just because I was around or was I not-Mair?
I was telling you why i was not working on tuscatsi.
When's the release again?
Somebody give me 23e plz.
I want to buy guilty gear xrd.
Woo finally Exalted Karuyo.
What did you become ?
All in on that next session.
FO4 updated and now my plugins aren't loading.
Yeah looks like it.
What are you running for mods anyway ?
...it is overwriting plugins.txt on launch.
Survival with enemy and PC damage from normal.
I guess set the file to readonly.
Man that webm is super low res.
Anathema guess you'd better try to look after the army of golems you're in charge of tomorrow!
MoonWolf they changed the console key to be the proper one.
MoonWolf did you unlock the next trial yet?
D.Va's face is a bit fucked there.
Roll20 has already forgotten both MoonWolf's and my cookies.
Pretty much what Noelor said.
Thanos more like Smugnos.
Tracer looks knda glazed herself.
They're eye-shaped at least.
Anathema look it's your perfect game.
How's the exaltation prep going?
2023 Roll20 has already forgotten both MoonWolf's and my cookies.
MairBear MoonWolf trial tomorrow noon before I leave for friday? also 50roulette.
Don't think that's a time bears are awake in.
I think mairs awake before me again these days.
Well that was ANH and TESB rewatched in prep for TFA next week.
A bit too late for ROTJ.
MoonWolf griffins with important questions.
They are very important questions.
I'm assuming this isn't a LoL thing.
PoE and I know.
I can do act 1 at least.
Wish I had my writing high performance .net code book with me.
This is kind of like noon right?
Mfw I write a short 30 line class in C# that would literally be one line in F# _.
Is a MoonWolf around?
Able to hop onto FF for glenn's roulette? o.
Anathema will love that one.
I'm moving to Bath.
ChaosSmurf that was a fast promotion.
Are they going to make you shave now to seem presentable ?
ChaosSmurf man now instead of no sun ever you'll get sun every now and then.
He'll burn to a crisp.
Colleague got the rapey Xmas song stuck in my head =<.
MairBear oh are you nearby.
Anathema he means baby it's cold outside.
ChaosSmurf like. 2 hours still.
Closer than any other doomies*.
PoE doesn't start until like 9.
There are so many PoEs now.
I'm guessing... NEW PATH OF EXILE SEASON.
Oh hey star wars is next week.
You better want to see it again 'cause I'm in Glasgow from the 20th!
Yo this zarya t is cute af.
Noelor you got yours yet.
ChaosSmurf I am wearing it right now.
And only that? How dirty.
Anathema ChaosSmurf like. 2 hours still.
I wonder if this'll ever make it into KanColle.
Nor glorious nippon enough.
Well home early for once.
MairBear just shout over me its fine.
Nice 4 commendations in trial as black mage.
Anathema sorry did I? D.
No no Noelor said shush Mair wants to attack when I was talking about Oglaf merch.
Anathema I think Mair has a quieter mic though is the thing.
Solo queue MMR is a wonderful thing.
Get on a losing streak get paired with worse and worse players and lose more games D.
Anathema every single time magnitude is mentioned...
I think 'pop popl.
Noelor isn't it cute af.
Anathema add Jetada as a 1-dot ally for now also get 5 normal xp 4 solar xp 5 charms and 2 willpower.
That's all original trilogy movies covered for thursday.
Anathema I seem to have accidentally glued the rubber ends of my pullup bar to my doorframe.
Well not glue glued.
I'll work it out at some point.
Anyway I now have a sofa \o/.
MoonWolf did you need 50 roulette for today?
Doing it righ tnow.
Happy to help you with yours however.
<- this this is quality gamebryo coding.
MoonWolf I am laughing so hard.
Noelor there are some other gems in that thread.
While I am against replacing old characters like that I like this cover.
Oh this is cool.
One of the terrain plains spells is next turn cast a daily elemental air or fire spell.
Air and fire are all attack spells.
The highest-level plains spell lets me link two allies' health pools together o.0.
By the power of druidism we can use mairbear to make osmoene else squishier.
Our party is generally pretty squishy though.
Alright that's all the druid spells of level 5 or lower transcribed into macros.
I don't want to see your macro bar.
My macro bar has three buttons.
Recovery and the 2 at-wills.
The plan is I'll tick others onto it when we're in the relevant environments.
Or in the case of elemental spells when I've prepared them.
This does mean I and therefore you will need to know what terrain every encounter is in though.
But there are only 8 and they're pretty broad and self-evident.
Like I'm pretty sure we'll have Forest next session!
Goddamnit zhuge liang.
Oh the rain's turned back into rain.
It was snow for a bit.
Why is Dum Dum Dugan in FFXIV?
Oh I already had Giants on GoG. Derp.
<- wtb 1 source plox.
Someone is measuring strawberries in pints.
I blame the USA.
Because the internet I am being told that there is in fact a market for panda boogers internet!
I thought the measurement of strawberries was a punnet.
ChaosSmurf finally got around to playing Kingdom Death Monster last night its pretty rad.
I can't tell if my dad's being dense or an arse.
He just brought round actual garbage from my old room that I hadn't thrown out properly.
We're talking empty carboard tubes a monitor stand with no monitor...
Going to err on dense.
ChaosSmurf Star Citizen hit 100 million.
Now to waste that that cash.
On images of imaginary spaceships.
And hopes and dreams of imaginary spaceships.
MoonWolf is there things today?
MairBear we could do roulette things.
I'm watching Ironicus' Chicago history video.
And I think he's using an actual slide carousel click sound effect?
It's really fucking distracting though.
Don't even remember the sounds.
MairBear MoonWolf sorry cant just now got friends over.
No worries at all we thought as much.
Should we Aethero without you or should we wait till later ?
Um. Well its going to take me a while until I can do it so if you want it now do it.
Well mair is eating now.
So for the moment.
OPM best anime.
My brain's doing emotions and I'd rather it stop because it's distracting.
Hate it when brains do that.
I'm going to watch that.
Because i genuinly love the cheesyness of independenec day.
I mean me too.
Just watch Independence Day?
Oh I will most assuredly watch that and grin like a goof.
Of course they built an ARG viral site...
Which seems to have killed off Will Smith's character.
But also undertale in a nutshell.
Yeah they replaced Will Smith with a white guy.
Nah his characters son is in it.
Luckily not actual Will Smith's son.
Yeah that's a relief.
The best scot.
Hmm the intermittent event of looking ahead to next year's cinema.
They're doing a film on Deepwater Horizon.
Also Dan Brown's Inferno gets an adaptation.
Nicolas Cage is doing a WWII naval film.
In fact don't do that at all.
A grave error has been made.
The real question is what this tweeter was doing on the loli tag of sadpanda anyway.
Sure he's evil but he's having fun.
Oh sure everyone abandon mumble just as I am free again.
The finn is free. ruuuun.
MairBear did you do the things?
Also yes run run!
Got MW's DRG to 60 through goofball and then milled around.
Well I'm doing a thing then.
Was it a good thing?
It was a decent thing.
Also Glenn you didn't warn me about OPM I lost my entire night and went to bed at 7.
Once again I am stuck because C# has an insufficiently generic / flexible type system.
These generics are just not GENERIC enough.
You know how C# generics are runtime?
In Haskell / F# you can have generic type parameters at runtime and statically resolved type parameters.
SRTP are used for inline functions for example remember + is a function in F#.
You can also use SRTP to say your function takes type parameters ^a and ^b where a^ + ^b => ^c.
MoonWolf did you run the level 50 roulettes?
Oh good dad's gone back into patronising mode.
All is right with the world.
GlennCuddlefish last nights yes.
If you want help i'm perfectly happy to assist.
Robot is creepy again.
It is a good pain.
Kirisu isn't that the natural state of dads?
Anathema precisely why it's a relief.
ChaosSmurf do you have to make/contribute to a GotY list this year?
What I wouldn't give for a word document with separate tabs. D.
Minister yeah I put SC2.
I'm also doing an awards list with such categories as.
Well It Was Good On Console.
And Game Weâ€™re Most Looking Forward To Playing The Sequel Of In 2017.
Do you have one for Game Most Improved By Mods ?
Isnt that most games anyway which makes the category moot? p.
MoonWolf just got a job advert for the netherlands |.
And the same weather as england.
I like that the location is.
Where in the netherlands.
Its all the same right.
Its not all the same.
It's a small flat country can't be that hard to travel through it.
Not like scotland where you have a mountain every 20 feet.
Anathema if you as someone going here get a job in the randstad or say groningen.
If you had a job in friesland or zuid limburg.
Anathema no but I might replace one of my other categories.
Because that's quite good.
Inb4 you pick Doom.
Not the music choice I expected.
Startrek we watched fury road and it looked nice.
Anathema it would need to be a game of this year.
But Doom is the best moddable game ever.
But doom is a good game without mods.
Some games are... not.
We need a category for that.
They have a category.
It's even recognised on Steam.
You just look for games made by a company called Bethesda.
ChaosSmurf don't let it get to your head.
I think we all know it's too late.
It has never not been too late.
Ye Lav en Aberdeen? They got a new use for sheep up there. It's called wool! Stay classy Scotland.
But here have a not-at-all-controversially-titled video about tanks.
A video that I had apparently not clicked back to.
MoonWolf Ashley is so emotive her clothes are affected.
Playing/broadcasting Undertale and hanging out on mumble if anyone's about.
We will be about in a sec.
Oh I saw someone wearing one of these on youtube.
MoonWolf so there's a new handful of monsters in darkest that can appear anywhere.
I ran into one that is quite horrifying.
Not my game but.
His first move? Retreat to the back and summon floating heads and spines of player classes...
I lost my level 5 cleric to a heart attack because I had to retreat.
Because he summoned 2 scoundrel heads and one man-at-arms the scoundrels mauled me pretty bad Dx.
Well it is Darkest Dungeons.
Also you know death's door?
They decided it wasn't bad enough.
If you get a death's door and recover you get a massive stat penalty till you finish that dungeon run.
Thats a bit shit.
Oh! Here's one of him being pretty mid attack and blurred out is a scoundrel head in background.
Oh great his coat is faces.
Called The Collector of course.
I think I uh hurt my lower back on Saturday.
Noelor do you still drink rum? thinking about getting a nice one for my brother 'cause he likes making cocktails but I know almost nothing.
Last night in WHFRP we hired a surgeon to cut a players arm off he took it surprisingly well.
ChaosSmurf should do this for a future expo.
So you know how you people said I shouldn't wear an oglaf t-shirt to work?
Someone here has a suicide girls hoodie.
Looks all bets are off then.
Although that is the person who is trying to go a year wihtout being called into HR p.
I think my oglaf stuff might turn up when I'm in Scotland though.
Although that is the person who is trying to go a year wihtout being called into HR p <- we all have our own life goals.
I want to lift a car.
Good gods I think I was in bed for 112-12 hours.
Its good for you!
Mairbear went to bed... like 3 hours ago at best.
Ya'll need to fix your sleeping schedules.
I was surprised I got some decent sleep tonight as it felt like I spent most of the night before my parents got up rolling around.
Anathema mine is fine.
Well time to do some roulettes.
Really stupid like darknest-level stupid smut idea a character whose name is pronounced the same as the medicine.
Because a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.
No that's more a joke to be used in a story than a smut idea p.
Not that Im even sure how that would work as a joke.
So that degrades it to at least AFF level stupid.
It's a joke character.
Its got like 3 paragraphs.
It's like image caption length joke smut.
Do you live near a park or something?
This is a raketenwerfer it werfs raketen.
Weird definition of announcement.
I haven't been but it's probs suitable for a run if that's what you're thinking.
I'm choosing to read that as saying they accidentally made the game exciting but hotfixed it back to status quo.
They accidentally added a way to let you get 101% reduced enemy attack and movement speed as an aura.
MoonWolf is your w a soft v like German or a diphthong like English?
Also known as anything tahts not a boss just doens't move anymore.
MoonWolf boss OR curse immune!
MoonWolf you logged out last night just in time to miss another fantastic cooking minigame btw.
The dutch W is harsher than the german.
The frisian one is much like the german.
Some words ending in W use it differently.
I was mainly trying to pronounce werf.
Which I guess I found out!
I just like the idea of a rocket thrower.
We all know about grenade throwers.
Though now I'm just curious about diphthongs.
I think it's werf in German too? As in flammenwerfer.
I'm sure there is youtube videos all about dipthongs.
Kirisu no that was all german.
In dutch it would be werp.
Anyway there will be plenty of videos about English diphthongs.
But less so in other languages.
Yeah there isn't really extensive youtube videos about discussing dutch language in detail in english.
Although if you learn Chinese or Japanese you start to appreciate diphthongs.
I found a video about vowels !
In fact Minister just go check this whole channel out.
There is probably a few videos there you'll dig.
Drive is such a great movie.
So here I was killing a massive amount of robots.
Took me like 20 minutes in combat to kill them all.
So I finish the combat and check the computer terminal next to me.
Dont save or anything since what could go wrong.
And MY WHOLE TEAM RUNS THROUGH 2 FORCEFIELDS INTO ELECTRIFIED FLOOR AREA.
GlennCuddlefish Asking for it there.
It was like 2 steps from me.
Well ok a couple more but why would the AI run through forcefields in the first place?
Now it died to a forcefield.
Forcefield more like ripfield.
I think at this point I would be better off just telling my companions to stay right there and soloing this place since nothing seems to penetrate my armor.
..Except when it does and crits for half of my health.
Those are the options.
Man I hate it when that happens. Practically no damage fo the entire combat and then I get crit 3 times in a row for what combines to 160 damage.
<- good video.
MoonWolf I did it again.
And it gave me Varian.
So I played it and got chillmaw malganis and harrison jones.
You're making Brode proud.
I'm still debating if it's better than feugan/stalagg.
I think it is.
I have Loatheb and it instead.
And the 4 drop is useful.
How did I cycle to Herithia.
All that time magic he has.
Has to be messing up technology somewhere along the line.
And made you disconnect.
I mispelled her name when setting up my nick list.
Looked okay to me.
There's an extra i.
I only noticed because that line didn't ping me.
Anathema I never drank rum such as to become a connoisseur - try Glenn.
MoonWolf I like the onomatopoeic saai for boring.
Playing Lili in a level >20 PvP game.
Is getting ganked and insta-killed whenever I'm around 2+ enemies.
Anyway we eventually lost.
So last night I tried going to bed early.
Like I think I was in bed before moonwolf.
Ended up waking up around half past one in the afternoon.
Catching up on sleep debt.
I didn't even have sleep debt.
At least I shouldn't have.
>linguist giving an actual phonological explanation of the Dutch G.
Yeah i can't do that.
Though how the fuck y'all ended up using the letter G for that.
Huh TIL Noelor runs hero league now.
I havent ventured out of QM yet.
I would rather do ranked than QM.
More reliable chance of decent games.
You got shafted by your team's comp a bit.
Yeah I have no idea why Malf Malf'd.
I had to pick first.
And had 1 more support for quest.
Then zoned out while they were picking.
How deep was the nova pick?
Haven't they just fixed QM.
Or whatever it is.
Khara on opposition after? and did they talent into the reveal on Q?
Er theyve patched a bit for its matchmaking but not all the way they plan yet.
Will now aim to prevent a double warrior comp facing a quad assassin comp.
I'm going to go back to Undertale now I've cleared a daily slot.
GlennCuttlefish level 50 roulette at some point ?
Sure gimme a moment to do this area in fallout 2.
So here I was climbing down some ladders in a place full of hobos.
And the downstairs is full of floaters centaurs and who knows what else.
Its an article exactly about you GlennCuttlefish.
Huh Bayonetta will be in Smash it seems.
Dob which Nobunaga anime was the one with the Nobunagas on Motorcycles?
This is Mair's description.
I only watched the one where Nobunaga had a giant robot provided by Leonardo da Vinci and duelled with a Julius Caesar who also had a giant robot.
Then the one about a girl who fights aliens by carrying the soul of Nobunaga which manifests as a tri barrel assault cannon.
I assumed it was one of those.
But I guess not.
BwaS MairBear meant sengoku basara.
MairBear is also bad at describing anime.
I haven't seen it o.
Just seen -of- it.
D D D D D.
MoonWolf today I discovered that if your crew gets annihilated in DD the stagecoach ignores it's level and upgrades to at least offering 4 men.
I started a new game and am doing a rules-of-nature who needs torches run.
Or a LOT of vestals.
0 light = more loot.
And also rare miniboss xD.
MoonWolf 2 stress tests.
Urgh VS still can't extract classes into files.
MairBear could you hop mumble for a bit.
Need to test new headset.
Going to be a while need to convince my pc to play sound on this thing.
Mu.
Ff14 bows are like wow shoulderpads.
This one is a harp.
This is not the first time a bow has been a harp.
<- ksbd is getting all TES again.
Ftrbzzs you need to get Geoff on IRC we just had an announcement about redundancies.
Its OK only people I don't like are affected D.
Maybe if they weren't shit they wouldn't be at risk of losing their jobs! it isn't 100% yet there is a consulation process to go.
Redundeancies caused by a massive dip in markets.
Is hardly being shit at your job.
No but the 3 people being let go /are/ shit at their jobs.
One of them is a misogynist too.
With multiple complaints to HR against him.
Well fuck that guy.
AND Trump lost his court appeal against the Scottish Governments windfarm thing.
Today is a good day.
Trump was in a court case in scotland over windfarms.
He bought some land to build a golf course of w/e because he was promised or w/e that the government wouldn't ruin the view by building windfarms next to it.
You can golf with windmills on the horizon.
Known for centuries as the man who destroyed scotland.
By building some fucking windmills.
11 of the things.
Thats not even that many.
Whats he so fucking upset over.
Not getting his way.
I still don't understand how people find wind turbines ugly anyway.
MoonWolf can you win a game of HS pls.
What a nice man.
ChaosSmurf that was pure pure skill.
That guy was fucking terrible.
ChaosSmurf it does feel nice when he fails to kill my ysera and i just entomb his kel'thuzad and wipe the board.
Getting very close to telling the finance department to shut the fuck up.
Undyne's death scene o.o.
MoonWolf did you see the FFVI opera pastiche in Undertale the other night?
I'm sitting through it again.
I thought everyone was dead.
Undertale spoilers in the description and probably related videos if anyone here still cares?
You see because there are literally walls of fire.
Noelor i see i am not well pleased though.
Still adorable 3.
Prepare for me to start playing Undertale a bunch again.
I have those turned off anyway p.
Like any sensible person should.
Ok turns out I wasn't on genocide I was on bad person mode.
So I get to play through a third time!
You failed at murdering enough people.
I murdered only important people.
Turns out you have to murder *literally all* the people.
Well I didn't realise the trick of it.
Which is that every area has a fixed number of random encounters.
Oh you don't have to just kill every random encounter.
You have to kill all random encounter in an area ?
Well thats a bit grindy.
Hence I'm now watching LPs while grinding the first area.
Killing literally everything lets you oneshot the first boss.
Also save points now tell me how many more encounters are left.
How gunked up are you at this point ?
Haven't had to blow my nose in a while.
<- not wrong.
MoonWolf MairBear roulette at some point?
MairBear in genocide mode you cannot pay for Tem to go to college.
Instead you must kill TEM.
No cool leg for tem.
Noelor doing a murder hobo run then?
I spent this afternoon racing through on what I assumed was genocide.
Only to get to the end with more questions than answers.
Realised I had only done bad end.
I'm now a little before the Undyne fight on true genocide.
And it is rough.
The game keeps its save data even if you uninstall it.
Oh yeah I saw a friending mentioning that one earlier.
My wishes have been granted.
MoonWolf that was glorious.
Anathema you seen the PvP changes in Legion?
It actually sounds pretty good.
I think i'll main the turbowaifu in XRD.
ChaosSmurf my first reaction is took them long enough.
Feels like I need to grab that soundtrack.
The instant kill theme is dope.
Its actually the main theme.
Welp I found this monstority again but thought to take a screenshot this time.
MoonWolf I could hit him with 3 attacks. Because back rank... as soon as i killed a head he summoned another...
And the vestal heads heal for ~10.
Which at level one... is a lot xP.
So far he only seems to have 3 heads though. Vestal which heals or gives a damage + acc buff. Scoundrel which just face-rolls with a massive crit rate and a 4/rd bleed...
And Man at Arms which spam protect ally on him...
Oh and he has a lifedrain attack too.
Also my houndmaster gained the zoophobia quirk...
MairBear he has a very scary dog.
MairBear airgame officially dead.
Second wave or day one mod will return Iron man for sure.
People don't care it's gonna be impossible.
You clearly did not read the article iron man mode is discussed.
I thought he said a little too challenging not more.
Sorry I went in with the title on my mind and was expecting that to be the verdict so when I glossed that paragraph x.
I won't miss the air game.
ChaosSmurf I have not.
ChaosSmurf now if only they gut the number of spells people have in general S.
Didn't they do that in WoD?
MoonWolf person complaining that Darkest Dungeon is too hard at level 5-6. And so much grind to get back there.
Turns out they were doing full dark runs... because they thought the higher crit chance etc made it easier x.
I'll needlessly make this game hard for myself oh no it's hard.
Its easier to crit though!
Obviously better loot is part of the easy mechanics.
Better loot can only make things easier.
What Noelor said checks out.
I found a cool web... comic.. media thing.
Derp. I was wondering why it seemed so difficult to get tokens now.
Forgot to unlock neverreap and fractal continuum.
I should get on that.
Yes we should. Maybe later tonight even if I fear mair will not wake up before you go to bed today D.
At the moment that seems a serious concern yes.
Ffs ChaosSmurf you were self-employed for X years how do you not understand invoices.
What did i miss.
Well the real awnser here Noelor.
Is that ChaosSmurf gave out the invoices.
He didn 't PAY them.
How can you write an invoice without understanding what goes on them!
I've not seen a CS invoice.
But i assume they come donw to i did this stuff it costs this much here is my bank account.
If I had to guess ChaosSmurf has not noticed the last of these?
MoonWolf that comic was cute.
By which i meant it still ongoing.
Good thing tomorrow is my last day this year.
I am about ready to murder something.
!note MairBear Damnit Mairbear.
He'll get that note.
Some point tomorrow morning.
Did you unlock the things moonwolf?
I did unlock neverreap fractal and lighthouse hard.
Guess I'll do that instead of more waifu practise now.
Waifu laifu ain't easy.
MoonWolf windows man.
Anathema see also files on my own pc i'm not allowed to delete.
And i don't mean special system files.
I mean just some random fucking file in some random fucking folder.
That just doens't want to fucking go away.
Yeah that happens from time to time.
You need permission from 'Domain\Anathema' to delete this file.
And unlocker.exe doesn't even work on my work PC.
I was about to suggest v.
I have one folder on one of my drives that can't even be deleted by unlocker because apparently it doesnt exist.
You have a folde.
That does not exist...
For some reason a torrent ended a folder with a . and I simply can't get rid of.
Try running chkdsk on that thing.
Its classified as a dll file instead of a folder because of the errant .
Yeah that's pretty much my reaction.
I might just offload all the files on the drive to other places and format it at some point.
It even says File type Folder .
In other news TFA seen. Opinion D.
I just created one with a . on the end.
Yeah now to figure out how to delete it.
Cooked_Auto you've tried command line deleting it.
No idea how so no.
I had to use bash to create it windows mkdir will strip the .
Maybe you can wildcard delete it ?
<- this article claims cmd del wil delete these.
Shell expands the wildcard correctly but then rmdir says it doesn't exist.
Turn it into a UNC path that might work.
Its a good thing you have a bash shell available.
Otherwise you'd now be stuck with that ghost file.
Bashing solves all problems.
I'm glad y'all are computer wizzes to tell us this.
So at work we have administrative shares enabled right.
Now I just wish I could fix a corrupt dll file elsewhere so my explorer would stop crashing randomly /.
Wonder if I can browse those in bash.
Which would be the last gremlin to haunt me.
'cause if so I can put undeletable files on my coworkers desktop.
With that evil thought I'm off to bed.
Now to figure out the command I need to type to pull off that file deletion.
I look forward to the day anathema gets to have a talk with HR about undeletable files.
Gah don't trust myself to write the proper cmd command >_>.
Worst case scenario you try to delete a file that does not exist.
And you get an error.
Or I wipe an entire folder.
Yeah I just moved them to a temp folder.
So I just went to the folder in question via WinRar and renamed it to remove the dot. It worked v.
Where did you get that idea.
Now if I just could replace the corrupt c++ dll then I'd be really happy /.
Yeah i have nothing for you there.
I figured as much. At best I'd have to uninstall my graphics card drivers and see if I can't delete it after that point since its related to an earlier version of those.
Because it's always C\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft.vc90.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.30729.6161_none_08e61857a83bc251\MSVCR90.dll that causes it according to the event log.
Or I guess reinstall windows but that's too much effort >_>.
So now glenn can be a wizard wizard ?
MairBear MoonWolf can we do roulette and /or those 2 dungeons?
Let me get and eat cereal.
Roulette and/or do those 2 dungeons and then do the roulette for those two dungeons?
Actually 3 dungeons I think?
Will hop on as soon as I get coffee. brb.
Whenever I need a giggle I re-read.
The Dread Thicket is now always 50% never fails.
Actual patch notes for today has .
The Dread Thicket is now always 50%*.
50% chance to spawn a stone alter.
Patches now literally influenced by memes.
I got very irrationally annoyed this morning.
What happened did you wake up?
Anyway no BBC were doing a bit on trans* youth.
We spoke to 'Lily' who is.
So I get all mad about putting people's names in quote marks etc.
Then about 5s later realise it's because they never reveal kids' names on the news.
And always use pseudonyms.
An actual sensible thing to do.
I'm shocked at this.
The bbc isn't unambiguously terrible just a deceptive government mouthpiece.
GlennCuttlefish only just now got my third wind crystal.
These things take forever to get.
Anathema high quality important news that everyone just HAD to know.
GlennCuttlefish where in Finland do you live?
Planning on being in finland end of june.
Anathema whether or not you think people *should* care about that they *do*.
Therefore it falls upon any sane news agency to report upon it.
Noelor but its hardly breaking news flash kind of news.
People *really care* about the roy-famz.
I found MoonWolf's new favourite YouTube playlist.
Noelor i think you might be wrong.
I wonder if mairbear will wake up before i go to sleep.
Otherwise it'll be more morning roulettes.
Noelor my flight back is gonna be 8pm from airport on the Sunday just to pass forward.
Good middle of the night MairBear.
Turns out I might start working next week. First day I need to get up at least 5 to catch a train >_>.
Good not quite morning MoonWolf.
Cooked_Auto thats a rought time to start.
Oh? Working as what?
There is a xmas party happening upstairs.
GlennCuttlefish MairBear roulettes ?
Or will we do those in the actual morning.
Database stuff of some sort at my dads job that they needed someone to do.
I didn't go to a friend's birthday party tonight becase I'm tired -_-.
Noelor also sick ?
And tuesdays is now SR too so I'm just going to take that lack of sleep on the shoulder and tell anyone who asks about to bite it.
Could have done with full sleep.
Of course I have no idea how quick after christmas I'll be pulled into it again sice its at least a 1+ weeks worth of job.
Is it wrong that my only motivation for this is money? Because I don't give a shit about this being used on my CV since no one calls me back on applications anyway so.
Jobs are for money.
Thats sort of the point.
Well some are labours of love. This obviously isn't. I'm going to have to borderline OD on sugar or something to keep me going the first couple of days considering my messed up sleeping schedule and the fact it'll be a sitting job.
Because I'm not sure tea will cut it.
MoonWolf how long will you stay up.
Because I am just about to have dinner.
At least an hour ?
Ok I'll let you know once I am finished.
MairBear a true hero of the people.
I should try to finish my genocide run this weekend.
Genocide run more like feelsbad run.
Nah that's ordinary badguy.
True genocide is just grindy and then nobody's around *to* make you feel bad =P.
He still believes in you.
Asgore is... not smart.
Also that's totally Undyne who thwaps spaghetti iirc.
But he's the KING.
Tbh it could be either of them and I wouldn't be surprised.
Undertale shows up in the volume mixer as Leading Brand UNDERTALE-type Software.
Its not... wrong ?
Ok there's a room just before Undyne that is sorta dark but normally you can still work out where the path is if you angle yourself toward your monitor right.
Actually full-out black in this mode.
EVEN GRASS HATES ME.
Life of a murderhobo aint easy.
MoonWolf game over I lost for not being magical enough.
Noelor oh no- lor.
MairBear I am watching the sans fight.
The fuck would I have ever even.
You would have had a bad time.
Noelor did you see the mettaton fight?
The music and everything...
The cap in this game is Lv 20 with 99hp.
If you reach that point there are no fights left =V.
Cooked_Auto i have questions.
I may or may not have answers.
Wtf is going on.
Decided to watch symphogear starts off pretty modern day magical girl. suddenly people are vomiting blood and the minister of defence is getting ambushed by foreign militia.
MoonWolf wtd is that ad.
How did Ford end up being the ones with that license.
Remember when cartoons just came out once a week.
Those were good times.
I might have watched S1 of pokémon as weekly saturday eps.
In terms of ones I remember.
I see she has her priorities sett straight.
MoonWolf any chance you could do a HS for me?
MairBear do you still need me to do that ?
Also pls kill me.
Did another bunch of fates in Azys.
I have my fancy crystals powered staff.
Still need me to go into dungeons though.
MairBear playing the hearthy stones.
GlennCuttlefish wish to join me as i do the groupable roulettes ?
Sure give me just a moment.
AF mumble but yay got the crystal things.
Got a free wireless speaker.
It wants me to install an app to get it to work.
I mean I'd ebay it if I had an ebay.
Wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone.
The world’s ending in four days and I’m in love with a robot girl. You're alright Persona 3.
And the prom sorry fair is in 2 days!
And the exam is due in 3 days!
Also senpai just gave the protagonist a key to her motorcycle.
Senpai is the best.
I believe this is the point where she's also in your active party ?
This is endgame so yes.
I've had the LP sitting in my dormant tabs for ages.
Symphobear the main antagonist is an eternally reincarnating woman who wants to blow up the moon.
I was not expecting this game to secretly be the best Zelda game.
She wants to blow up the moon because her ancient civilisation built the tower of babel and god got pissed off and cursed everyone with multiple languages by putting the moon in the sky.
She's going to blow up the moon with a giant laser cannon.
I was not expecting this game to secretly be the best Zelda game <- uhm which game are we on at this point.
Not sure i get it.
Its okay though a magical girl knocked the giant laserbeam of-course now the moon just has a massive chunk missing.
The moon is secretly EVIL.
Aigis is being very helpfull.
That's what robots are for!
Aigis is the best protago-sexual robot.
Actually i'm not sure female protag gets romance with aigis ?
Hence 1711 The world’s ending in four days and I’m in love with a robot girl.
So now i know where half of one-punch mans budget went.
To the last episode.
Aigis is sad about not having bits no matter which bits she thinks you'd want.
I'm sure that after the end of the world they can get tenga to install her some bits.
Or at least vibrating fingers P.
Those are bits too.
Saitama used one of his finishing moves Serious Punch.
Its the end of the year so its time time for more TRUE SLUT ADVENTURES.
Alright back to magical girls who get their powers from singing to ancient artifacts from a long lost high tech civilisations.
How else would you?
Noelor social links ?
!note MairBear SERIOUS PUNCH.
Am in Glesga now.
I really really wish MS will do something with the Midori code every one of Joe Duffy's blog posts is amazing.
Anathema when are they pulling all this stuff into roslyn.
Most of the big things you need a new OS for.
Or are things you can't change.
Windows 10 shouldn't just been windows midori.
With backwards .net compatibility.
Like in Midori Async is a struct but Task in .NET is a class.
With backwards compatible VM for old .net stuff.
This seems like a small distinction but if you have a system where *everything* is async the added overhead of a class vs a struct will matter.
If not in actual memory usage then in in GC pressure.
Midori about a dozen different GC processes.
One GC process multiple stacks.
This is really good.
Doens't timing get utterly fucked up with asynch EVERYTHNG.
And of course the problem with a new OS would be the drivers.
Yeah drivers are a pain.
Getting third parties to rewrite their drivers in midori language in a proper async safe fashion would be hard.
And if people can't use their hardware they wont use a new OS.
Maybe on midori printers would finally not be shit.
This is also why Windows 95 has so many amazing hacks like sometimes disabling interrupts when you ask it to but virtualising it other times.
Since they'd be forced to write proper printer drives from scratch.
Instead of slowly upgrading their shitty ones.
Maybe they could be an NT wrapper I dunno enough about drivers to comment.
Every negative thing Joe Duffy says about .NET is true as well.
You're going to find out what a language is bad at pretty quickly if you plan to write an OS in it.
Like trying to do string operatings without allocating dozens of new objects is /awkward/.
Or writing high-performance code in general.
Because nobody ever designed it to be super high performance.
Well they should have.
It was made for possibly huge managed desktop applications.
You can write a pretty good bit of game code in it.
But it was never designed for really pushing it.
I mean take your string example.
They made it they knew it happened.
Nobody really though thats a problem we should make it more efficient.
Well the worst example.
Is fcking bytes and streams.
I'm all about Shulk.
MoonWolf did you know you can run instance methods on null pointers in c++? they only segfault if they access `this` o_0.
Why would anyone know that.
Symphogear has a girl that i have dubbed girl-otacon.
Static variables are very expensive in Java and .NET. Way more than you'd expect. huh.
Basiaclly every scene with her in involves her saying this isn't an anime this is just like an anime or if this was an anime.
Also like every array access in c# is bounds-checked the query builder I wrote does a lot of array indexing since I took the gamble that some extra bounds checked would be cheaper than linq.Aggregate.
Since I didt want to allocate a new collection and then all the junk foreach does I really hope foreach isn't bounds checked assuming it compiles down to a for loop.
You are overestimating the impact of your bounds checks on performance.
They cared about the performance of a whole OS.
Including disk io and fucking ram io.
You just care about your own program.
Yeah you selfish programmer you.
Thats not really what i meant.
There is no opt-in way to get out of bounds checking p.
Sentinels also had a problem of being utterly indistrucable in one espisode and then cannon fodder in the next.
MoonWolf Joe Duffy's next blog post is going to be a deep look at the Midori-flavoured C#.
Did you read the safe native code bit? they taught their compiler to recognise the soup of inlined classes and instance methods that lambdas compile to so they could optimise them.
Also an incredibly scientific EGS today.
Why are yanks so bad at breakfast.
Dude I'd take either of those for breakfast.
MairBear neither of those are a breakfast.
ChaosSmurf are you going to put up an actual review/op-ed about Undertale?
I am curious as to your thoughts.
I'm so happy Nishkriya is back.
Captured today somebody getting mad about the etymology of the word meme.
In this the Year of our Luigi 2015.
Captured today somebody getting mad about the etymology of the word meme <- that was pretty good.
Shirley Oh they've got a class on how to write jokes.
Annie Don't take that I dropped it after the lesson on set-ups. The professor is so old.
GlennCuttlefish if you care to roulette i'm going to do them in a moment.
Err. sure. Gimme a few minutes.
Or..Apparently not. Seems my account ran out of time and my bank account is empty.
A more edgy protagonist than Yuri?
I take that back MoonWolf reminded me how chill Yuri was.
Butts my danganronpa save is corrupted.
Lol someone with a 2013 mac air gets 20fps in pillars when running windows not gonna bother seeing if it is playable on mine.
20 fps is playable.
On a 2013 mac air I have a 2012!
Wipeout was corrupt too wouldn't even start.
What did you do to your vita ?
Not use it for 6 months p.
This is interesting.
MairBear Patrick Stewart was considered for the role of Pierce Hawthorne.
Well at least the pain is not quite as bad even if they did not manage to remove the tooth today.
Stewart Pearce would just have been a different character.
Which is fine tbh.
GlennCuttlefish what did they do.
Anathema that article basically outlines what I thought was the point of Ep 1 when I originally saw it.
Before 2-3 went on to tell a totally different story but with arguably better execution.
Fixed the gap inserted some medicine couldn't pull it out since the x-ray crew is on vacation.
Got an appointment for when they are not on vacation though ?
MairBear strict workout routine of suplexing boulders.
A lot of those covers are pretty good.
No RPGs at all this week.
Including no exalted tonight.
So I'm going to get pizza and then.
So much free time.
I'm going to play SC2.
Because I did tell Smurf I'd play it after I was done with Undertale.
You finished genocide? O.
I realised that I never will.
If I end up with an entire day on which I have nothing else to do but git gud.
Maybe when we're invading xD.
That way we can totally support.
Maybe I'll play it up to the bit where Flowey tells y'all who're just watching me to git gud.
I was on the wiki yesterday.
Having decided I was basically done.
If you ever genocide.
Any future pacifist ends will be forever tainted.
Even if I could beat Sans.
Hey he does warn you multiple times.
That you're not gonna like what happens next.
MairBear a bad time indeed.
MoonWolf <- this is a photo that can appear after a true pacifist end.
You can't get out if you ever genocided ?
On the above as well obviously.
There is a girl in Life is Strange who is just nerd you save from things being thrown at her.
She's not relevant at some later date ?
The LP's just at the start of Ep 2.
Which is the point at which you save her from the second thrown thing.
Ff14 has ridiculous bows.
Some bows are literally fucking harps.
If you actually use a bard skill that uses a harp.
You pull out a tinier harp.
The acoustics are important ok?
I should not browse oglaf this tired because I'm not sure if this is a crazy dream.
Or the real life.
LiS deals with some serious shit.
There is a moment in this new Tales' trailer in which the kid character just stops and stares at the protagonist's butt.
Also is this related to Vesperia or not?
Because these characters are dead ringers for Raven and Flynn.
Don't think its related at all.
ChaosSmurf why does Zeratul have nipples?
My G13 forgot half of its keybinds for no apparent reason.
Iirc if anything it was supposed to be in the same world as zestiria.
But I think they scrapped that plan.
Is people with werewolf arms a thing in zestiria ?
People turning into monsters was.
GlennCuttlefish i got an Owlet Minion today.
Its the cutest little thing.
Check out undertale store page -> Minimum OS Mac OS X NOT el capitan.
Anathema unsure if undertale joke or actual apple os x version.
Noo I think this was the last yuru yuri episode of the season.
Well fall season is ending.
So that is pretty likely.
I hope there is something comfy in next seasons lineup.
Only one way to find out.
Spring has more JoJo and Phoenix Wright.
And Girls und Motorbikes- I mean Bakuon.
The thin men ARE HERE.
Everybodys been playing xcom.
Gotta reap any possibilites of save importing.
When the hells is Heavens Feel.
Its not feeling up to it right now.
Today I learned that during the colonization era in america native americans didn't usually destroy the homes of Finns.
At least not around the delaware area.
They didnt want to face the wrath of pissed off Finns.
Actually it seems they just got along that well.
I didn't even know there was enough fins there to count as a population group at all.
There weren't that many. I think they had disappeared by the 1800's probably assimilated into the general population.
MoonWolf el capitan is the latest OSX version name.
What happened to cats ?
Previous one was Yosemite.
OPM so good.
I should watch that.
Started watching Perfect insider.
This anime makes me wish I had a smoking room.
Finished watching perfect insider. It was a decent murder mystery.
It tried to be intellectual a bit too much but other than that it was good.
ChaosSmurf did you manage to book a train ticket for the 28th?
Bleh died to final stage of the boss in Convoy would have made it if I had gotten a single vehicle beyond the starting two the entire run.
Noelor genocide is true ending imo.
Which is why it taints future playthroughts.
MoonWolf do you have access to this.
You mean the whole thing ?
From being a back0r.
Its on my HD.
Have you watched it.
How old is it.
Techniaclly its part of my game as dlc.
Bits and i don 't really know.
Yyou cna probably torren tit.
Probably a good way to find the original release date.
Apparently we already wrote about it.
May the torrent is from.
IN THE FAST MOVING WORLD OF VIDEO GAME NEWS MOONWOLF.
I'm going to watch this relic of a video just now.
I might buy it anyway.
It looked p. interesting.
And I have nothing to watch because Christmas.
When is the great exodus to Bath happening ?
When I find a place.
End of jan probably.
Seems I was wrong MoonWolf they didn't scrap the plan after all.
I just hope the gameplay is better in this.
Going to be honest.
Considering the timeframes involves.
I mean the base mechanics were decent in zestiria it had a couple of problems like the AI being dumber than a bucketfull of retarded chipmunks and its over reliance on fusions and elements.
Really fusions were important because of the elements since that added the spirits element to your attack.
Well it doens't look like fusion is a gimmick this time around.
Instead it sturning your arm into a werewolf.
No instead you get a werewolf moodo.
Which while aesthetically different seems like yet another use this mode to win thing.
It was a fun gimmick the first time round in xillia 2 but I think it ruins the dynamic of the game.
Maybe it'll just be the overdrive ?
Or whatever they call it.
Build meter press button get supercool for a while.
Yes thats what it always was.
Still ruins the balance of the game.
Okay in zestiria it wasn't.
ChaosSmurf ya git answer my question.
GlennCuttlefish I've been in a queue for The Aery for 15 minutes... as a healer. wtf.
Nws for mentioning boobs.
Well that was a thing.
The original wasteland has not aged very well at all.
I didn't expect it too ?
The one you are on.
How was town ?
Crowded wet so on objective 1 was to pick up a missed delivery.
Came home to find a mail slip of a second missed delivery >.>.
Yep at this point I'd assumed it was just not gonna make it before I was back from New Years.
Don't worry the storepage is dead for me.
Yeah I can't login.
Thats how you know.
MairBear my anime weapon is now awakened.
I just did 10x 80% chance-of-success actions.
I got 1 sucess.
It's so totally fun and not a waste of all the valuable ingredients.
Noelor Where in Composite as in say composite bow is the stress ?
Some people will say it com-POH-zitt?
Thats is what me and MairBear were debating.
ChaosSmurf you seen this game called Squad?
#1 reason for Valve to take the time to make the steam store out of native windowing stuff backed to an API instead of a website? so it can remember my fucking date of birth.
At least it mostly remembers the date you last put in in the boxes...
It still accepts that I was born in 1900.
Can someone look up who plays Teruteru in danganronpa 2 so I don't accidentally see if he lives or dies?
Recognise the voice so much but can't place it.
/ Jun Fukuyama JP.
Oh he it in lots of things I've seen but probably FMA most prominently Ying.
I really wanna play Mount Blade again.
Huh Warband has a mac version but Fire Sword doesn't.
Anathema mac version probably didn't do well enough the the developer cared to expend more effort ?
Although IIRC Fire Sword is basically a Warband mod done by a third party.
You loved hatoful boyfriend now enjoy hatoful attorney.
Omg in the latest Rimworld your colonists can have pet dogs and you can train the dogs to rescue wounded people 3.
Thats nice an all.
But its hardly aviary attorney nice.
Anathema only in people mentioning it and Marsh's thing on RPS.
One of my guys got hospitalised by a rapid tortoise.
Somehow I got a new colonist and i don't know.
But its a 16 year old girl called Conrad she has a gladius.
Don't let 16 year olds play with swords anathema.
Protip don't leave batteries out in the rain.
At least they weren't next to anything.
Big Red finally recovered from the tortoise attack.
Tortoise more dangerous than you think.
One of the guys just hunted a wild boar with a knife and took less damage than the guy that got attacked by the tortoise.
Your game lacks realism.
Or not its one guy.
One of my hunters spent 6 hours trying to shoot something before giving up and going to bed.
What the fuck.
>my sister unironically shares Celtic FC posts on Facebook.
Anathema did you somehow not know about this?
I barely ever log into facebook.
And also no for the price thing too.
I meant the price thing.
Now I could be sleeping.
Or I could be betting on retarded super mario party 3 AI games.
MoonWolf what do we think of the GDQ schedule.
I hope Ori is good.
Oh shit someone's actually doing Cloudbuilt okay I need to check that out afterwards.
ChaosSmurf its okay ?
Do you think they're going to go full e-sports again.
Oh god its nice to be home early.
Today I even had my own office for a while O.
And then I get home early and get dragged into troubleshooting our wifit network. Again.
MoonWolf So much salt.
That is quite a bit of salt.
Wow it just keeps going and going and going.
Not sure what I want to hate right now the appletv device that refuses to work or our wif.
Apparently turning it off and on worked. As in ripping out the powercord because it doesnt come with an on/off switch.
That was an incredible scroll.
I didn't read it.
Who is John Wick.
He seems slightly psycho.
He's written two books played Play Dirty which tell you to be as much of an assholish DM as possible.
Ah he's worked for white wolf I'm surprised.
Seems like he knows his card games tho.
Here's a readthrough of the second book first one is most likely archived now.
Nobody even kicked any of them.
Hardly a boston dynamics video at all.
Once a year they'll get a break.
Omg this salty DD3 rant.
Noelor its so long.
He's actually losing sanity as he types.
Yeah Wick has a bit of an ego. An ego the size of a medium sized asteroid.
Shame that the Playing Dirty 1 review is in the SA archives by now because its an amazing insight into his ego and his way to GM which is pretty much an archetype of GM vs the Players and the GM should always come out on top in the most bully-ish ways.
ChaosSmurf SC2 has so many Blizzard Cutscenes.
I swear SC2HotS didn't have as many.
I'm two planets in.
Super 3d.. noahs... ark.
Fucking WISDOM TREE GAMES.
Noelor where do you reside?
How get there what do etc.
MairBear I'll meet you in town on.
Do you have an actual portable device I can get in touch with you on?
Channels of communication available in this modern age include Skype Facebook Twitter IRC SMS.
I don't think Steam has a mobile app.
I might also be imagining the b.net one.
Ok I think I was just thinking of.
Which is WoW g-chat only.
Hearthstone is on mobiles and must include at least some b.net functionality?
MoonWolf watching this numberphile.
Noelor yeah they pulled out all the stops.
They are the worst they are actually amazing.
It has way more Stuff than any of their other games have.
Noelor I have shitty texts.
That should hopefully get reception in NCL.
Wait Smurf is here.
ChaosSmurf what time do you and Ana arrive in NCL?
My dad goes back via flight at 8 PM or something so hopefully I can escape by that time? 28th etc.
MairBear assuming I'm reading the backlog right and ana and Smurf are on the 1500 out of Glasgow Central.
They should arrive into Newcastle Central at 1733.
Allowing trains being trains of course.
So aim to get there for around then.
And we'll all meet up at the station.
So this year my friends gave me a chocolate pipe and some pipe tobacco that smells amazing.
Like the packaging alone smells like some kind of christmas tea.
Both of these conversations are fantastic.
Update for christmas I also got military grade pepper spray.
In case you meet a bear in the finnish wilderness?
....Yes lets go with that.
Why do you have that glenn.
Friend gave it to me.
MoonWolf if Darkest Dungeons was not an early access game would you be happy with how complete it is? its 50% off atm.
Its just missing the actual dungeon its named after.
So what do you delve into at the moment?
The cove the ruins the warrens and the weald.
But not The Darkest Dungeon.
Think I'll nab it then.
It might even run on my mac.
Allegedly it can opengl 3.2.
Probably won 't have great performance.
If anyone wants 50% off Endless Space I have coupons expiring on the 1st of Jan.
Seems to run ok.
Trip to town mostly successful.
Got parents' presents but forgot wrapping paper.
Wrap if in newspaper its novel or something.
Like that exists any more.
Hm annoying. Decide to finally make the switch from an old utorrent version to qbitorrent. Only problem is that now my torrent speeds fall under 1MB/s.
It might be set to the throtle mode.
Click the little dial thing at the bottom.
But thats been checked off in the options.
Dont have any rate limits set.
Dont think anyone else is torrenting right now and the router we have is good enough to split that up.
Right now the combined speed is 1MB/S so I think it has to do with that.
Hm regardless of what I do it refuses to even go slightly above 1.0MB/s.
That is really weird.
It just reaches 1.0mb and then evens out there.
Its capped at 1.0 to the point that it will throttle other torrents if something else is faster.
Meh I'm digging up my old utorrent install since this refuses to work.
Hm deluges site is fucked. So lets try transmission qt then.
People who know when do I get a 4th weapon slot in Borderlands 2?
Go to the big city i believe.
Was that not 3rd?
Though thinking on it that prologue is looong.
Ill return alive evne if it kills me - anime dialogue.txt.
Now thats a fucking weld alright.
There gifts finished. Christmas is over.
Software developer job adverts are almost literally useless.
Cooked_Auto still doing it wrong.
I have Lego to built and you don't so clearly I'm the winner here.
Well I have Lego some books a pair of glow in the dark Star Wars coasters an Alarm Clock and an Evil Genius mug and pillowsheet.
My brother got the Lego Batman Tumbler. The big one.
He wanted it too if I remember right.
Sadly dad couldn't get me the Lego SHIELD Helicarrier.
So I got a jet and a helicopter instead.
It is rad as balls.
Danganronpa 2 does not fuck around.
First christmas dinner was good. Christmas boozing was decent until we moved to the traditional pub.
I mean its a tradition and all that but that pub is terrible. Music is too loud drunken middle aged karaoke doubly so.
Sort of streaming video.
What was the place we stayed at during summer?
Cant remember the name specifically but I guess I can check emails later.
Well thats not helping I was trying to remember what the lake next to it was.
Oh looks like those mails have been deleted from my gmail due to age.
Ah well. Thanks anyway.
Ask Edi if anything.
I'm sure you have on some kind of social media or steam.
Sadly she is not on steam atm.
Hang on I think it was Magelungen.
Look it up on gmaps if anything but I think that was the lake in question based on its location.
Good morning also merry christmas.
Last night I learned my brother supports Donald Trump and doesn't think Scott Adams is a dickbag.
It snowed for like 10 minutes last night so I got my Christmas Wish to see snow.
I don't know who Scott Adams is and I don't want you to tell me.
ChaosSmurf the dilbert guy.
What did I literally just say.
MoonWolf / Cooked_Auto - what's the deal with golden keys in BL2.
Does the loot scale to your level?
From what I remember yes.
Is it all ridiculously OP.
You can do some ini fuckery to increase the drop rate if you really want to get some of the better stuff without having to grind like an MMO player.
From what I remember the golden chest just gives you some random blues and oranges but nothing ridiculous.
I dont recall the boxes dropping oranges all that often.
Mostly blues and purples.
Oh yeah. my bad on that part.
ChaosSmurf you shoulda said nothing then.
Anathema why is it every time i hear about him your brother becomes worse.
Your sister is just normal amounts of annoying.
He really works at it.
I have no idea.
Next year I'm going to use all my holiday up so I can't be here.
<- why is this so good.
It makes no sense.
Managed to have family dinner without any fighting great success.
Its not THAT hard anathema.
But they're scots MoonWolf fighting is in their blood.
MoonWolf you havent met my family.
I bet i could get along with your family.
Your sisters not the worst your brother i'll just have to deal with.
Wow Steam is absolutely fucked right now.
I have seen thes things.
Yeah apparently there is a major DDOS attack or such going on.
Not just sale hammering ?
That should not show somebody else your payment details wtf valve.
The only thing people can see in full is paypal e-mails.
I can access someone elses steam wallet.
Â€“ownage5557 6 points 29 minutes ago.
I went to try to buy something in my cart next thing you know it it lists some random persons name address friends list and partial payment info....
You can do nothing with it though.
Nvm I got my own wallet back now.
Go to try to buy stuff and it'll fuck up.
ChaosSmurf showing other users someones address is still really bad from an IT security PoV and may be in breach of data protection laws tho.
Huh where did I get 50eu from. If I didn't know any better it's my brother christmas gift to me as he mentioned yesterday he gave me money. I'll have to check with him.
Yup just got some guys name and address.
All I get is email and last four numbers in their phone number if they've set it up.
If you then select visa from the dropdown you can sometimes get more.
Hey look another stupid thing happening because they don't have a proper native store in the client.
Ah turns out the 50eu on my account was my brothers christmas gift to me. He just forgot to tag it anything special.
Steam store has been shut down now.
EDF! EDF! EDF!
I'm sure we can link these images aaaaaaall night long if we so want to.
Not my steam payment obv.
I reckoned as much.
The bagpipes are not nearly flaming neough.
Reached out to unplug an USB cable.
Pulled out the power chord instead.
One of these days I'll actually wire this thing properly so I dont have to start it with a screwdriver.
There should be a show called 'The King of Bel-Air' where Will Smith plays a similar role Uncle Phil was playing in the fresh prince. yessss.
One of these days I'll actually wire this thing properly so I dont have to start it with a screwdriver <- yes do that.
Wait crap it was saturday already?
Emergency exalted planning oh!
Might turning into exaled planning oh no! at some point.
Well so much for that plan. Found a commando stream.
It's snowing.... It's a little late for that now I think. >_>.
Snowed here earlier today. And I was so close to having a snow free christmas.
Apparently been snowing for the past couple of hours based on the coverage. Pretty thin one but hey snow vOv.
Well time to finally have some genuine christmas leftovers.
It seemed like it was a really a show that required your full attention.
Maybe after I fix some food.
Broken food is the worst.
Includes steven universe songs.
How is this still going and only at this point.
Its a lot of effort.
Disgenious answer They want to milk it as much as they can. The obvious answer People have lives and its a hobby.
Nah I actually was wrong about where they are.
Because I remembered the sequence wrongly.
Thought Gohan being super-saiyan was waaay earlier.
Thought Cell was SSJ2s.
Ohhh right the superpower that spawned a thousand vore fetishists.
At least they are the less creepy variety of vore fetishist ?
ChaosSmurf I'm gonna be in town significantly earlier than planned tomorrow.
I really hope you mean Glasgow.
Because we've arranged with Mair to all meet at the station.
When your train arrives.
Both parents are working tomorrow so if I want a lift into the station I need to leave the house at 1030 if I want a lift to the station.
I'll just play my vita or read if you can't make it until the agreed upon time though.
Have you been to geek retreat yet.
I might pass out early.
Do you have my number.
Is that the place just outiside Central?
Aye was there last year with Gimble.
It's loathesome in theme but alright in practice.
Noelor is a good albumn.
I do not seem to have your number.
Is that yours or ChaosSmurf's?
I know you didn't mean mine.
Ok that is yours I have that one.
I can't remember the last time I saw you and got a new phone um...
Last year I guess hells.
Have I seen you since Hogmanay at my house 2013?
I don't think I have.
I have yours Noelor.
Could swear my phone's newer than that though.
Noelor all the texts I have on that number are about Mage.
ChaosSmurf gie us yer number.
Huh I used to have your number...
You've commented on its tiny number of numbers before.
Where do we torrent these days?
I have a site bookmarked.
Is tpb back up?
Been for a couple of months.
I use both tbh. Mostly because its easier to find mvgroup releases on tpb.
That MC theme is cute.
No listing for s2e4 of Flash.
Guess I'll... check elsewhere.
Arnold is a hero _.
Well finally managed to watch inside out.
These are my questions.
At times tears werea possibility.
But clearly I am dead engouh inside.
Was on a plane.
Which I'm told gives me an excuse.
I mean sure but how?
Apparently men maybe women as well idk on planes cry more.
Because of atmosphere both in the literal sense and the who is around me where am i one.
To be fair if I ever found myself on a plane I would probably cry as well.
Have you never flown glenny.
And I never will if I can help it.
It's just a giant metal death cage.
Vantaa has been lost.
Fucken died on the first level of the dungeon last night in DCSS what shame. I blame all the whiskey.
Jeez the transistors in the new intel cpus are 70 atoms wide.
Beautiful sunrise this morning.
Nice clear and cold.
Sun still isn't up here.
Problem with winter is that if the sun is up it's always so low that it hurts your eyes.
Balls I should pack.
Noelor its good grace isn't stalling to give people a chance to talk about their feelings that would be rude.
>orc wizard on the first level of the dungeon.
I appreciate they have new digivolution vids to show off.
But when all 8 digidestined show up to the first fight and all digidestined-mons need to digivolve at once it makes for a twiddling thumbs period.
How many levels of digivolving are they doing at that point ?
Because if they have to go up 2 or 3 steps.
I think thats just a whole episode right there.
Well 7 of the 8 arrived rookie status with Gatomon hardlocked to champion level.
5 of that 7 had digivolutions playing out just up 1 tier.
But I did think hey Tai sure it's a Kuwagemon champ I think on its own but why not send Agumon through warp digivolution and let's get this over with.
Yeah but what would the episode be about then.
Passed that onto some other FF14 players I know.
On train wifi ChaosSmurf got sent to his ctual seat instead of the one opposite me.
This wifi is questionable.
Wish we could move to actual winter weather now.
Fuck 10 C in the evening at the end of december just isn't right.
Wish the winter would go away.
MoonWolf I showed that video to Mair.
And he said thanks.
Tell him no problem ?
GlennCuttlefish do you have paypal.
Mair said you ran out of FF time and it's Chritmas.
It's Smurf just got paid mass.
Me trying to learn accurate inputs instead of mashing with the stick.
MoonWolf you got a url for that cute futurist lesbian webcomic from the other week?
I had to keep adding adjectives to that sentence to get specific enough still not sure I managed.
It has an rss feed.
You could have gone with webcomic from the other week probably.
Also you have an update to read.
Omg it's even cuter.
Better lovestory than shades.
Mair Noelor and ChaosSmurf are still all asleep and it is nearly 10.
Passively aggressively make breakfast loudly.
I had the kettle on that was pretty loud.
I'm not sure how elves are involved.
I died in DCSS again after a good run because I fell down a hole in the elf lairs and got smacked by floating weapons of Holy Wrath I was a demonspawn they huuuurt.
Thats what you get for being a demon.
Also falling into holes.
Still not feeling it.
Oops a city council here accidentally declared 5000 people dead.
Then sent letters to their next of kin informing them of the death.
MoonWolf from Mair.
Thats not even a joke.
Tell mairbear to get some irc capable device so i can inform him he makes terrible jokes.
He has been confirmed.
GlennCuttlefish how are you finding Grim Dawn.
Its solid. Still has some bugs.
Just got gifted it for belated birthday present.
Music is good voice acting decent if you liked titan quest you will enjoy the gameplay.
Going to 0C friday.
Might get frost at some point this winter even!
Warrior is a bit slow on gameplay arcanist/whatever witch doctor was fun in my experience.
Actually warrior might not be quite so slow if I wasn't on veteran.
Also was built for anything but auto attack until I get my shield build going.
What does veteran do ?
Also more named monsters I think.
So better/more loot ?
And then i assume three increasing difficulties for beating the game.
Since its a diablo-like and all.
Also more shrines which allow you to get bonus skills.
They just didn't do anything to the character/inventory screen.
They just reskinned it.
Same layout same tabs same weird additional bags.
Why fix what isn't broke.
Mitsudomoe is on crunchyroll?
Sure why wouldn't it be.
Well I wasn't expecting lewd chubby lolis on croll.
He's not Harvey the wonder hamster.
A perfectly ordinary classroom hamster.
This series has the best anime dad.
You sure are watching a show.
It escalated from there.
Well since I decided to cut back on gaming until my wrist starts working properly again I have now finished first season of mitsudomoe.
I had prevoiusly seen half of season 1.
So I've been watching these for 3Â½ hours now.
I had no idea that they were releasing a new Planescape book.
I have not seen so much child murder since my second to last fallout 2 playthrough.
Anathema after everybody is awake etc could you please make sure the blinds and window are opened in the bedroom?
Also my stomach is currently expressing disapproval of the volume of meat and/or alcohol I put into it last night ~>__<~.
Or apparantly in Ministers case slightly less good.
Moose don't give a fucking shit.
That's what the long legs are for running in the snoo.
Minister it is done.
You make that sound so sinister.
I don't like undertale's combat.
Anathema omw home do we need owt from Tesco?
No clue what you meant by owt so i'm going to go with the idea that you just shorthanded/modernized ought.
Owt is the opposite of nowt.
Its so obvious now.
Clearly makes sense now. Clearly.
Minister when are you back.
Oh you're on your way.
I'm going to start cooking.
And no we don't need anything.
Also we broke a lightbulb but then we bought a new one.
ChaosSmurf what are you cooking.
*insert burning apartment community gif*.
With the pizza guy?
Huh TIL its sauce then.
Could've sworn it was community at least vOv.
It's the most overused gif on the internet.
Eeh I'm sure you can count some old dancing gif of a dancing animal or whatever as that because who knows how many of those got used on geocites back then.
Took em a while.
But at least they've said somehing.
High level cooking from a 2 time personal chef.
Is that your input.
I'll play this card.
Shut your whore mouth dixit is amazing.
MoonWolf Undertale spoilers on Nishkriya.
Dunno if there's anything you can do about that?
Noelor's house is making my face swell up this is un-good.
I didn't know I was allergic to anything.
Pets? mold? indoor plants?
Whiskey didn't fix it last night so I'm all out of ideas p.
Feather pillows or duvet?
I used a memory foam pillow of Noelor's thinking that might be it. My sleeping bag is down but it is only my face that is itchy.
It might also be washing detergent on the pillow case.
You can try using your own shirt as a pillow case and see if it helps.
I'll use the hood on my sleeping bag prooperly.
That should help too -.
I understand Undertale Star Wars and OPM.
All the others are lost on me.
MoonWolf is that the whole thing?
It may not be but thats what was linked to me.
It's a 2015memes version of the usual comic.
Which is in fact longer and more about gym ppl.
Do you know the source? I just know them from /fit/.
Google image search for source ?
Found the rest of the pages on /fit/.
Minister is there a towel I can use.
In the cupboard under the pans.
Minister not where i'd look for towels.
It is the cupboard inches away from the bathroom door.
B not going to press play but.
The makeup looks rad.
Ana is currently playing through Undertale while he's at mine.
I didn't turn the sound on.
But that was exceedingly hot.
It is at athat.
All of the things above.
I'm now humming one of his battle themes.
I'm okay with that.
I really need to get round to copying the understand ost into my phone.
There is now an orange and white spheroid astromech rolling around my office and slamming into the door and I couldn't be happier.
Concept stuck in my head.
Look i can't help it that just saying the phrase once is enough to make you get music in your head.
BwaS but how big is it ?
Just shy of the height of a can of coke.
I reall yneed to go see that movie.
I would say you should but ISTR liking phantom menace during its cinematic release.
Minister do you want anything from Tesco.
I want somebody to !note me that gif because omg.
I think milk's ok but check it and maybe replenish?
We need more mixer too right?
Can get some from across the road tho.
Did Ana get meds?
He did but they aren't working I think.
Is an eulogy correct.
Because it's a diphthong.
One thing I like about Star Wars is or feels like it obeys the laws of physics.
What the hell Star Wars has Brady Haren been watching.
One of the recuts.
ChaosSmurf why did you even ask me.
Keeping track of NPC relations.jpg.
Diphtong is one of those words my brain has for years refused to learn the meaning of because that just cant be a real word.
Kirisu because a colleague typed it in a tweet.
And it read weird but I wasn't sure if that was because it was wrong or because english.
ChaosSmurf ok I assumed you had written the tweet.
So it was more like why would you ask and then ignore me.
Anyway it should be right but isn't.
GlennCuttlefish in theory English diphthongs are w and y.
They're the sounds made by running two vowels together.
As opposed to true consonants.
It's only really a distinction that matters to linguists though.
Linguists are all just horrible nerds.
This is a fact.
Many of us are quite good at it.
I believe MoonWolf's point still stands.
Kirisu sure some linguists are not horrible they are in fact massive nerds.
Kirisu do you know when you'll be back?
Half past mebz a little after.
I see what you did there.
<- tis actually looks really good.
They must have had originals stored.
Happy new year.
Happy 2016 from the Noelor flat.
Gasp Outsider updated again O.
MoonWolf Wait for it.
How long was I supposed to wait again.
That was more wait for it until you get the dumb joke.
Ah. Too drunk for that P.
I am on a train.
The wifi is free this time.
They bloc imgur tho LITTLE DO THEY KNOW i have an SSH tunnel.
My face is really itchy right now.
Maybe it's just Newcastle in general.
GET OUT OF OUR CITY.
I think I am now.
If the itching is immediately cured.
You should be good.
This train smells of burnt rubber.
Don't you love public transport ?
Sounds about right for tusk.
Should be in Peterborough soon o/.
Anathema OSX wasn't smart enough to realise I didn't want to boot to the non-existent Bootcamp partition any more.
So when I rebooted it said there was no bootable drive.
<- how does this thing have SO MUCH FANART.
Ah yes. That.
Looking forward to that!
From an interview with Flash I`m not a guy who can do love and work both my APM isn`t that high.
Giong to wait for it to go into release before i tackle higher difficulties/new characters.
Its warm enough out there to stay out there for 20 minutes with my coat open yet cold enough for my fingers to go numb it seems.
Still hvent beaten it. I think we are in chapter 4 with my friend on my highest character.
Been running an absolute class cannon warlock build if I can stay away everything else dies under my skyshards if anything gets close I die instantly.
This does not seem like a great idea.
It works in coop.
Whats warlock arcanist + ?
Except when it doesn't.
Err. whatever the summon/eye of dreeg class was.
I picked occultist for curse of frailty.
Just the two straight up casters.
Well that was easier than I expected. Dropped the skill that made me a true glass cannon for now picked up mana shield.
Actual mana shield or just a magical shield ?
Seems to be magical.
So Ayla fucking murders people eh.
Had you perhaps misunderstood her character arc ?
And also kises apparently.
Oh it's a dude.
MoonWolf Well that last boss was on some bullshit.
Yes yes it is.
Maybe if it wasn't so happy to spawns so many adds.
Bit awk that Frog has this super sword.
Oh wait he can.
He just didn't have it yet.
ChaosSmurf you may or may not enjoy this lp.
MoonWolf this vocals-only Champions is... something.
At minimum hilarious in the instrumentals.
Likewise I need to process that it's been nine years today since I started my first LP. Jeeezus TDI.
So far in this game Oh I'm not drunk anymore? Time to go spend 300euros on a shot of whisky.
Yakuza 3 to be precise.
Damn you yakuza 3 you drive me to drink.
Wonder where mair is.
This meme is going places.
Cooked_Auto Arkham Asylum the game guards have awful trigger discipline.
Are we talking guard guards or goon guards?
Guards you can speak to.
Dob what is your opinion on Mercedes Benz?
They exist and are a car company.
Maybe outside of my price range.
They do good F1 though.
Mair and I have discovered free Mercedes Benz DLC for Mario Kart.
Yeah remember playing that at uni.
Resulting in my run with Nico Yosh-berg.
Great scrolling downwards on my mouse is getting slow.
Im guessing my mousewheel is giving up the ghost slowly.
MoonWolf>> well I'm glad someone got it.
Aaaaand I think my mousewheel just stopped working completely.
No response on scrolling and clicking with it.
And now its back to working. for now it seems.
I'd go out and get a new one tomorrow anyway.
I dont think any nearby computer store has the mouse I want.
I'll have to order one in this case.
I just cheap default mice.
Ah I prefer one with at least two sidebutton for PTT and forward/backwards in exploder.
Up to the point i left for lunch anyway.
Much much faster than the previous run i saw.
These internview bits are still maximum overcringe though ChaosSmurf.
They kept the interview bits eh.
In theory its a good way to fill downtime.
Was kinda hoping they'd learned.
Hey you guys want to help me with a map at some point?
You know I scan up my map then you add areas to it maybe even name some of them.
Just draw random splotches in roll 20 or something.
What is the map for ?
My exalted 3rd edition.
That is rapidly turning into romance of the hundred kingdoms.
It was very oglaf.
Noelor tell mairbear to go home i need him to win a match of HS.
I left him at the airport a couple hours ago.
He's probs airborne atm?
Also isn't ChaosSmurf online?
I never try asking CS because its like 50/50 if he ever reads it.
Y'know I don't think blizz likes win-trading.
Its not win trading.
There is a daily quest that requires you to see one of your friends win a game in spectator mode.
Huh that's a new one.
Its worth a pack instead of gold.
Also I thought mair was somewhere in the uk seems odd he flew out of ncl.
Mair is in the uk.
He's in wiltshire I think.
Distant SW of England in any case.
Hmm I guess train would then take a while...
Maybe I'm just the sort to hold back from uk domestic flights for commutes.
But maybe it turned out cheaper for him or something.
If you're doing the height of England though train and plane are comparable.
In both price and time.
MoonWolf I'm going to flail at brawl for a bit.
Please just decimate + flamestrike already.
Oh that explains it.
I am bad at secrets.
If you're stuck on a bad heropower.
Because its worth it to get more useful ones.
Over sitting on one you never use.
I actually thought I couldn't if it did nothing.
Some do work some don't.
Ok this one only works if there's minions.
So I guess I should have reduced the minion to 1hp before dealing 4 damage?
Cooked_Auto she has horrible running form.
Noelor see now thats value for mana.
Sorry it took so long =V.
C_A I've heard about that minigame will experience it once I get to yakuza 5.
Yakuza i mean i guess i could do some japanese crime but what about all these dumb side missions and minigames.
Medibot brings up a good point space is pretty formal.
Figured what totaled my phone.
It was my charger.
Because it's just totaled my other phone.
The old one is now taking charge.
So presumably this one will too in a couple of days.
Despite air delays of 2 hours.
<- UnderTale peeps.
MairBear how did you get delayed 2 hours.
On a 50 minute flight.
I think the plane goes to Southampton and comes back to Newcastle and does nothing else?
But apparently it broke in Southampton or some bullshit.
Fucking winter has arrived.
Slept in so bad I didn't have time for breakfast luckily it is the start of the month so there was free fruit.
Ftrbzzs I turned my notification sound down so Telegram wouldn't beep in the office so instead it plays a sound through the media system very loudly...
I need to yell at the developers that is really rude.
You can barely see it someone said just been to the bathroom entire face is still red and lumpy p.
They were being nice anathema.
Anathema any clue what caused it?
I've had some rash for a month or so think I need to find a new washing powder.
My best guess is either the washing powder Noelor uses or the foam in the pillows.
This song is amazing.
Should've bought that pomegranate from the shop after all..
Basically done by one guy too.
Oh really? it's really good.
Some proper hipster metal there.
Yeah its really warm.
-20 forecasted towards the end of the week.
Stig's Japanese cousin.
She's the strongest... at motorcycles ?
No I'm pretty sure she just likes Motorcycles.
Bakoun is a series about girls who love motorcycles in this case. The anime of it starts next season.
If â€™s buddies in the First Order have a manifesto don't be surprised if point one is actually it's about ethics in galactic domination.
From an article I don't want to link because not everybody has seen Ep7 yet.
Its -12 out there.
Maybe where you are vs where a measuring station is?
According to one of the stations near me its -14 feels like -20.
<- sauce?
GlennCuttlefish complain to the weather service i use.
I have discovered that MEGALOVANIA.mp3 loops perfectly.
Listen to it for hours and hours.
A contrast in LP methods.
I'm sure a thoughtfull comment is coming any moment now.
I did not successfully ctrl+v.
This might help?
Okay thats probably been enough understale ost for today.
Enough for me for today.
GlennCuttlefish May or may not be up your alley. So far I like it even if I'm only 2 minutes into it.
Will check that out once I stop watching AGDQ.
That'll be a while then.
Alchemical exalted status we ended up in Malfeas met the Scarlet Empress.
Were persuaded to free her.
Are now fighting a 2CD her pet DB akuma and a handful of 1CD mooks.
So for tomorrows SR session we are doing a christmas special because downtime happens during christmas and new years Including gift giving 3c.
Also I suddenly need to get more Glitch Mob stuff. Christ this is good.
So how much lego did you get this yr CA?
My brother got the Batman Tumbler.
I wanted the Shield Helicarrier but dad couldn't get it.
So instead I got a pair of the creator kits.
I found myself at this event over ecksmas was pretty rad.
This is the kit my brother got.
Those front side panels look like they were in a TIE fighter kit.
The big one I got. I am really easy to please when it comes to Lego.
Like a wing piece or something.
Separate pieces you can see them on the side of the jet as well.
BwaS> those front side panels look like they were in a TIE fighter kit <- you mean TIE Interceptor?
Could have been an interceptor I dunno or maybe one of the thematic prequel ships like a trade fed droid fighter.
I'm trying to find those cute comics about bugs.
I know the ones i think.
I hav eno clue what they are called.
I couldn't remember who the other bug was.
Oh gods that new years sherlock episode was dreadful.
Like I know it was dreadful when S2 ended with them writing themselves into a dead end.
Which they then handwaved had tumbler fangirl wank for an entire return episode.
The entire latest season was wank.
Then got bored being original and needed to resurrect killed off characters.
Not as in bad as in masturbatory.
But this just took it up another dreadful notch.
Still fantastic last season haven't watched this season Smurf says it's still good.
O intensifies as the episode continues.
Yeah flurries is a good word.
Flurries and fucking ijzel.
All hail the spider pagoda.
Oh no Exalted this week.
Pls no SU spoilers this week binging it all with friends on sunday.
Man we need more build machines.
>3 agents all busy two with 20m+ builds 3 items on the queue for the other.
Meanwhile today is Shadowrun Christmas special time 3c.
Haha got an email Your recent Maelstrom's Edge order 487501 has been shipped. I've already received it.
It was also shipped.
Think the screen on my phone is proper fucked now.
You and CS can join a club.
I rebooted it 5 times and it works again.
Thats not a good sign.
Spear of Justice best song.
Thats a terrible euphemism.
Hm. stores are closed tomorrow.
Hopefully its mellowed out there.
Checked my thermometer that shows -14.7.
Just slightly around bitey.
Nice and nippy at -166 Â°C.
See thats about 10c below nice and nippy and right into oh great bear gods teach me how to hibernate for 5 months until this passes territory.
At least it's warm inside -.
If only it was.
Unlike at anathema's place *cough*.
Ftrbzzs I put the fire on fer ye!
Your rooms are still freezing though.
They are at least 8 degrees above 0.
Still pretty damn cold.
Anathema much appreciated -.
ChaosSmurf doesn't suprise me.
Hah on my birthday of all days.
Damnit white march part 2 and xcom 2.
Basically at the same time.
All these games I can't play because of Path of Exile.
Maybe some day I'll play Pillars.
So can we talk about gay spacerocks now anathema ?
MoonWolf those space rocks though.
MairBear they were pretty rocky and from space.
That starts next month =p.
Then I have no explanation for.
Well it was going to be dimmu or cradle of filth.
Yeah I know Melodifestivalen is a long slog but I don't think it's january.
Undertale stuff don't look if you're Ana Noelor.
Plenty of the behind the scenes pre-national selection stuff is going down though.
And I think some of the vote by acclamation of the non-powerhouse competitors might be getting done.
Our takes start in February.
I remember this because last time I got hospitalized the same weekend the first trial or such started p.
Last year that is.
Have caved and started smurf accounts for the Heroes RAF gimmick. Feel violated.
MoonWolf censorbird who gets confused when boobs disappear is a good character imo.
Tonight I will try to finish Undertale I guess.
How far are you?
Not played since I got to Undyne.
Played Hero Quest last night my hero is now a Champion!
That doesn't do anything.
Didn't brew my tea for long enough might as well go home day is ruined.
I woke up at 5 this morning so I played some PoE got a boss that I could literally not kill but could also not kill me.
Had to just run away _.
It was close a few times!
This motherfucked got possessed by a Tormented Cannibal.
So he kept summoning adds which I killed because I can't not do AoE damage and he ate the corpses.
Sounds like kiting was the solution.
I have no ranged!
I kill things by blocking attacks and doing 3 counter-attacks.
Also had a Kole that got possessed by a Rogue...that is a lot of incoming damage.
It was a thrilling fight.
This is magic.
My boss already did a blog post saying out framework wont be supporting 10 in the next version in that we wont deliberatly break it just wont go out of our way to fix with the version after that actively blocking 10.
Not too shabby.
Also these chrome version numbers are stupid.
I like how everyone besides safari has gone WE NEED MORE VERSIONS.
Chrome has high versions.
We need high versions too.
Well basically Firefox did that.
Other people who are based on chrome probably just bump their version when chrome does.
Opera went from a reasonable 12.1 straight to 15 and then followed into the same major version bump every update.
Andriod browser moved from 4.4 into 46.
Edge decided to start high at 12 instead of 1.
12.1 was the last non-Chrome release.
Android Browser /was/ seperate is now basically Chrome IIRC.
Edge probably starts at 12 because its kinda IE 12 p.
These are all great rationalisations.
That don't change the fact that the chrome versioning warped everyone to do the same thing.
We must have high versions.
If your versions are not at least two digits you're not good enough.
Why are you looking at this ?
External platforms built on top of us have taken.
// dependency by using private reflection on them for getting system resource strings.
Someone pointed out the first comment to me because it is amusing then I kept reading.
Honestly i'd break those out of principle.
Option to disable tabs cycling with mouse wheel the Vivaldi developers are wise.
Or they wouldn't have put that in in the first place.
Sadly disabling it doesn't make the page scroll instead it just doesn't switch through tabs at lightspeed.
This sounds really dumb.
If the mouse is over the tab bar.
Still weird to be in there in the first place imo.
Lots of feels in this thread _.
Sure there are.
Ok those weren't visible on the thumbnail.
I meant on the Rex.
One of the guys in the Edinburgh office doesn't do new developments he is going to open a PR for on feature branches.
How's your face btw Ana?
Funny enough the source I found that on is pretty big on scientifically accurate dinos and recommended it.
Not swollen mostly not lumpy still read various areas that were hard to apply cream too are flakey should be normal soon.
Still itches like a motherfucker.
Doctor said I shoulda gone to hospital earlier >_>.
What did you do try eating live bees?
Clearly I'm not welcome.
I realyl want to know wtf caused you to have such a reaction.
Was it full of bees?
Description has the word wazoo in it not opening that.
>Implying that the guitar/kazoo cover of Rules of Nature is not the best thing ever.
Legit good though.
Cooked_Auto I still have no idea what that is but it is cool.
Someone on SA has this as an avatar.
And its the cutest fucking thing.
Its a proper adorable.
Well caught up on that crazy murderer lesbians manga again.
Is the manga about crazy murder lesbians or is that a description of the author?
Its a manga about crazy murder lesbians.
Pretty sure glenn means murcialago.
Which is about a crazy lesbian mass murderer.
Who kills other mass murderers.
Who are sometimes also lesbians.
And also her driver/handler and her ever expanding harem of girls.
And if you're like.
What kind of name is that.
Pretty sure its the name of a car.
Because japan names lesbians after cars.
GlennCuttlefish one day this will be an anime.
And it'll be the best anime.
Dunno. not sure it would be as good in anime form.
Pre-emptivly put down salt just now.
Hopefully we won't get to much freezing rain.
Noelor some seriuos freezing rain basically shut down all non vital traffic in the northern part of the netherlands since monday.
I somehow forgot that was a thing.
We are on the internet.
Language is weird here.
Anyway more freezing rain is predicted for tonight but work for my mom can't really get away with not having them go out much longer.
Morning routes my still get cancelled.
Hopefully for the old people they won't have too.
But she needs to actually be able to get off of our driveway to start with.
Noelor i have magalovania in my head i blame you for this.
-18 is warmer than today.
MoonWolf does this help.
The image on the Undertale wiki that warns of spoilers is Toriel =3.
Dreemurr is an anagram of murderer. sure.
Don't have time to watch.
The one you just linked!
Can't afford more music in my head anyway.
Never are people more critical or nitpickish than in matters regarding things they would prefer to find sexy and I do not desire people messaging me to let me know that I did not draw areolas to their personal satisfaction along with guidelines for how to draw them “properly”. people are the worst.
The nice thing about taking people on dates in yakuza is that you can order everything on the menu.
Have some extremely excited basset hounds.
Mairnai so this is a thing now.
Sadly not voiced by Nolan North or Pete Dinklage.
Mairnai btw tonight there will be an xcom 2 stream.
Also thinking about the gatekeeper more.
They finally put in the FUTBOL.
Beagle will be so happy.
So it will probably be absolute hell to shoot for reasons.
Really hope cyberdisks are still in.
Welp thats what me being done with my assigned work task until dad gets back to me on feedback v.
And outside its still snowing ffffff.
No idea if I want to head out to the cafÃ© or not because of that.
Walked to work in -24 today you'll survive.
Its still below 0.
Ftrbzzs where the hell do you live.
It's -24 in the south close to -40 in the north.
Must be worse than Glenn then p.
It's fine outside as long as it's not windy.
At least my phone app says its light snow.
Ftrbzzs do you still have skin left?
Oh well cafÃ© doesnt open until 1 anyway so plenty of time for the weather to get better/worse.
It's all about layers -.
The skin has multiple layers.
It'll grow back. It's fiiiiiineee.
Anathema did you say you're watching SU on Sunday?
Also how's Undertale progress?
Was too tired to play it last night.
Just realised I never got round to showing ChaosSmurf the dating sequence.
Considering switching the constant loop on my phone from MEGALOVANIA to Spear of Justice.
I'm on atm.
Spear of Justice did not loop as well.
Ngahh! or whatever it's called.
I was not far off NGAHHH!!
Got a US and UK time for that stream btw?
Wanna pass that along to friends.
Ftrbzzs in 15m I have a skype meeting with someone called Terje and I don't know how to pronounce it despite hearing it pronounced already D.
Is that enough dates ?
I cant help I know a Canadian and a Scot who both are interested in it.
Is this guy okay MoonWolf ?
This tuber you've linked.
Will need to throw a few moneys towards this 0.
Is this guy okay MoonWolf ? <- don't know don't watch him.
He was just the earliest guy with an overviwe video about the 5th class i knew about.
ChaosSmurf apparantly beagle is going to start streaming xcom2 at th etop of the hour.
Don't know if you enjoy watching him.
Otherwise there is the firaxes stream the hour after that.
I'll have to watch the punch-out run for agdq later.
!note MairBear Beagle started streaming xcom2 first thing he did was MAKE IT HARDER in the .ini files.
The description on this video for Bonetrousle is Someone requested this I think.
I bet it was Papyrus ¬_¬.
Sounds like a boney situation.
I should go cook but I dont want to leave my room.
I am sure its at least 5 degrees warmer here than the rest of the house since I have 2 displays a computer PS3 and my amplifier running.
Its still cold in this room.
My radiatior is so warm that I worry it'll mess up my warhammer paints that are standing on the table somewhat above it p.
MoonWolf did you see Solomon's tweet about it.
I hope it's fun hard.
Its probably perfectly doable on normal.
They just like pointing out how hard it is.
I assume easy is normal.
Classic is impossible but fun.
And legend is lolxd.
Legend has almost double research and build times.
I guess it's Long War Mode.
Because legend is for people who think impossible iron man is too easy.
I don't think there's anyone who thinks impossible ironman is FUN though.
On the stream today they described it as doable but you have zero leeway.
Oh did they do an official stream.
Bout 2 hours ago.
On the firaxis youtube yeah?
It'll probably end up there yeah.
Oh my god waypoints.
Also if your move would put you in LOS of an enemy it gives a little symbol next to it.
So no waste can't actually hit from here moves.
Yeah I saw that in EG's vids.
Probably the best thing ever added to a game.
Also reloads are now a move action instead of a turn ender.
I don't think they've actually fixed the LoS.
But I guess making it so you aren't ever tricked is probably just as good.
Meanwhile the worst change is making the cinematic camera not = a kill.
Just turn off cinematic camera completly.
Ah okay he edits his live streams.
This is pretty good.
If you blow up a roof and you can blow up roof tiles now things on it fall down and take fall damage.
This is a great way to kill stuff.
Yeah that's pretty useful.
Its basically double damge on a grenade.
One of the better parts of Apocalypse.
Sectoids can make cryssalid zombies.
They die if you kill the sectiod.
I assume they also don't hatch.
They just get zombied.
Those new orb enemies have an aoe version of it.
Yeah I posted about them today.
They look fairly terrifying.
I prefer the new UI so much MoonWolf.
They can actually use pc UI features.
Like every part of its design is just better.
Not being console is the bes tthing.
ChaosSmurf also its going to be modable.
And it has women in it.
Tbh I'm kinda surprised the full build isn't on TPB yet.
It only went out to press and youtubers.
They get nothing from pirating it out.
Anathema>> aye saw that one.
This vid better have some solomon in it.
Yeah but it went out to a lot of people.
And PCG say it's the full thing.
RPS and our guy thought it wasn't.
Beagle said it cuts off after the second ingame month.
Probably has all assets and stuff though.
Seems like PCG's header was just a bait.
Pretty kinda shit one though.
Wow this livestream is garbo quality.
The one you linked.
And the game window isn't even centered.
Beagles YT was A+.
It looked fine live.
Looks HELLA piss now.
Oh wow the first mission actually changes.
RANDOM MAPS OH GOD IT'S GOING TO NOT BE SHIT.
Yeah they are procedural like drop in tiles ?
Yeah I assume it isn't true random.
Just lots of predefined bits put together.
They make a tile for a kind of enviroment and it changes a little bit inside of the tile and then shoves those tiles into a bigger layout.
But there was what.
12 maps in XCOM.
Bit more than that but yeah.
I know the basic layout of every xcom eu/ew map.
I expect I do and I haven't even played Long War etc.
Long war randomizing start position helps a bit keeping it fresh.
But its not nearly as good as randomizing.
Because you still know exactly where everything is.
And before long war randomized pod positions.
You could even predict exactly where enemies would likely be.
I didn't have the quality of stream turned up.
Yeah that it doesn't a have auto and b start on the highest.
Come on you can do it Twitch VOD.
I believe in you.
I can download at 18 megs a second twitch.
Also a lot of the combat bark lines were kept.
Jesus what a complete pile of shit their systems are.
So your guy with a shotgun still shouts they are adjusting sights when they missed someone 2 tiles away.
Maybe he should adjust eyes.
Resorted back to medium because Twitch's servers can't handle it.
Imagine actually working for Twitch and thinking we're doing a good job.
Services community it's going well!
We still randomly give people the old flash player every now and then.
It can barely handle medium.
One of the most constructive AMA's I have seen on reddit evar.
Adding loot over meld and then actually good objectives is such a good idea.
I get the feeling Shen is going to be an unbelievably shit character.
Compared to Doctor Dark.
I'm sure waifu shen will be great.
I hope the other chick shows up.
Her dad's confirmed dead though right.
But probably not actually.
The ski mask seems hardcore.
Do Sectoids not have guns.
They prefer bullshit over shooting.
Is this EU/EW sectoids or open XCOM ?
MairBear its xcom 2 sectoids.
Because they just lifted the xcom2 embargo.
MairBear xcom 2 sectiods can Mind Controll from mission 1.
Want to know another fun fact.
Xcom can shoot units they take over.
If there is nothing else to do enemies will gladly shoot MC'd units.
On top of that.
They know you don't want to shoot them.
So they take really risky moves with them.
You no longer taze people.
You shove MIND SPIKES into them.
Its the ethereals chosen mount.
But on a positive note.
Reloads no longer end your turn.
And also all the other things they did.
My guess on the bot...around....-17.
Stupid Ana stopping me talking about space rocks.
Spacerocks are good though.
If you have a burning need to talk about them I could set up a regex to ignore any lines containing #SU p.
MoonWolf how has FF been going btw?
It hasn't really since the new year.
Have not renewed my subscription.
Ah expired too? Or just not refreshed?
It expired towards the end of december you were not there GlennCuttlefish doesn't play atm. didn't have anything to do besides the same stuff again.
So i just didn't pay again.
Yeah makes sense. I was just wondering so far I've logged in plenty... but had no compulsion to do roulettes yet. xD.
And next month is xcom month.
And Darkest Dungeon month.
I mean tehnically yeah.
Whoa what? Speaking of darkest I logged in and checked the option changes.
Combat delay penalties- Heroes get stressed and enemies can call reinforcements if you take too long to kill them. The stress part I knew.
Oh this combat's hard huh? Guess we need to add more guys.
Can we just keep the reinforcements and remove the stress.
To be fair the only times I have triggered it is when there's 1 monster left and I'm abusing stuns to get free rounds of healing.
Just throw reinforcements when that happens.
Also one Quality of Life change I love.
When characters go all crazy from stress and you tried to heal them and they refused it right.
It no longer steals the healers turn entirely.
You get the action back.
But can't attempt the heal again ?
Can't heal that one guy that round at least.
Also they've added more easy options for example you can set monster crits to just do max damage instead of multiplied.
I like that one.
I'll skip it for now but I do know I've grumbled about how a single crit can ruin a perfect run.
Yesss now I can get the level-up sond for my ringtone.
Welp it's been three years eight months and a couple days since I wrote that first Final Fantasy X update. But here are looped around back to the opening scene. Holy shit this LP has been a goddamn trainwreck.
For the first time this week I can't bring the tune of MEGALOVANIA into my mind.
Because someone started humming Gold-digga.
You had a good run.
MoonWolf or in fact a bad time.
It was the best of times it was the worst of times.
More Undertale spoils still no Ana MoonWolf Kirisu.
Todays spacerocks was pretty O.
Depending on your day perspective.
I need to catch up >.>.
I somehow didn't realise it was just the one episode.
Pls feel your sins crawling on your back already.
You feel your tem allergy crawling on your back.
Isn't the tem allergic to me?
No no the human has an allergy according to the fight with the temmie.
MairBear its a stevenbomb.
See when I was visiting for new years Noelor told me that. But I forgot the relevance beyond that SU was just back.
A Steven Birthday Bomb.
I got MEGALOVANIA back \o/.
Caught up on spacerock.
I was going to be like already?
But actually half an hour would be right.
Fuchsia pink or purple?
The British government apparently is getting rid of the drink-driving limit in favour of just don't.
Glad someone noticed we don't live in Mad Men.
I can't fathom how or why.
But I'm sure my grandfather would object to that.
Tone it down on the product name.
Also even if you take the stats out its a Sumvision Cyclone Mini Micro Small Multi Media Desktop PC Full HD Streaming Media Player.
Mini Micro and Small.
MairBear this is neat.
I keep forgetting that's a thing.
Oh yeah steven universe updated.
Guess i'll have to check that out.
Since my friends are a bunch of bastards sired by judas and brutus.
What did they do?
Acquired their 30 pieces of silver by stabbing caesar in teh senate.
Just things getting in the way of our friday gaming sessions. Again.
Damn missed the start of AGDQ D2.
Well s'not like the middle or end are ever catchable anyhow.
Anathema you just missed countess runs.
I just wanted to watch the start 'cause PoE players managed to get the name ChrisWilson p.
Haha what some people order pizza and get it delivered to teh GGG office.
Grinding gear games people who make Path of Exile.
Anathema wouldn't you like free suprise pizza.
Just didnt know it was enough of a thing that a question about it was answered in the latest answers post from GGG p.
In fact I might even get some tonight.
Looks like an interesting puzzle.
If it had something on it.
The shape is interesting.
I don't fancy doing picturesless jigsaws.
!weather Newcastle Upon Tyne.
Unscientific measure of temperature too cold to sit on a metal bench.
Unscientific measure of temperature too cold to sit on a metal bench <- but very practical.
!weather remember newcastle upon tyne.
Now I am not saying its cold out there.
But my cigar froze.
Well it is relatively warm.
MoonWolf who's the foreground Saber?
Grand order is a andriod/ios game.
I think the story is that this is earlier in her life sabe.
Not Jeanne or anyone.
But summoned with caliburn.
Or the sheath to it at any rate.
Oh yeah that is not Excalibur's sheathe at all.
That thing swords go in.
Cooked_Auto that twitter is 100% followed by me.
Omg can't believe I missed this one.
Unscientific measure of temperature too cold to sit on a metal bench <- but very practical <- *butt* very practical!
Finally got my cast on crit build going in PoE.
Thats the weirdest engine I've ever seen.
Well -11 is better than -18!
In t his episode of spacerocks shipping charts.
Shipping charts are exciting MoonWolf.
Well that went better than expected.
MoonWolf tried different characters with my friend oneshot last boss on veteran.
What were you playing for that ?
I'm a shaman/arcanist my friend is full occultist.
I've got a shaman/occultist that i just got to the necropolis with.
Have high hopes it won't die horribly at the final boss over and over.
Will report when i finish ti.
Right I should be caught up on SU now.
Still getting mad over %s.
Warming up for XCOM.
Talking about warming up for xcom2.
Beagle wanted to see just how the game handles the new sequential overwatches.
Dear god what xD.
Thats a 24 person overwatch.
I think my favourite thing.
Is that it's over in the time it takes XCOMEU to do one sniper overwatch.
Oh the awkwardly long time to shoot overwatches still happen too sometimes.
Mostly on miniguns now.
I hope they fix it.
<- pushed it to the limit.
Is that a mod? xD.
Or does the game let you have that many.
I don't know exactly how beagle did it.
Probably modded some ini files.
I'll watch the actual stream later maybe.
Instead of highlight gifs.
MoonWolf you watched the HOtline Miami run.
Second worst commentary I've heard at GDQ.
Nobody has ever tried harder.
It was injoke central.
What did you watch that you rate worst ?
I didn't watch it but that Crash one from last year seemed too bad to place anything above it.
That was just a bad run in general.
Worst part is teh HLM run is v. good.
Thankfully Twitch's VOD service gave up before it finished so I just closed it in anger.
Man that final run was STRONG this year.
TASBOT into reverse Zelda into Bloodborne into Reverise Metroid into FF.
I'm waiting for the youtubes of those runs.
Going to watch bloodborne.
Probably skip the FF.
Hope they export quick.
Yeah I won't actually watch the FF run but they're always good if you're into them.
Hope they YT soon.
I miss 2012 Twitch so mcuh.
They were/are doing encoding and uploading on site.
But i don 't know if they are going to have their equipment in place there long enough to finish it.
Or finish it at home.
Better go check if they've loaded up anything good.
They are up to megaman x.
If you didn't watch it live.
Go wath this at least.
Oh they're pretty far through already.
They have a Beast of a machine encoding on site.
They started doing that last sgdq because they got sick of ripoff bad quality uploads from VODS.
Where do they get the cash for all this.
Putting ads on the videos.
Making money off of their work.
Isn't it literally the top guy's job now?
I wouldn't blame them for skimming 10% off donations tbh but I know they'd be torn to pieces.
Instead they donate to Prevent Cancer Foundation.
And Prevent Cancer Foundation hels fund their company.
Its a bit circuitus.
Oh I didn't know that.
I mean when i say helps fund.
Its not like they are paying tons.
I assume Twitch puts some cash in as well.
But thats how they you know.
Was more successful than ever viewers-wise this year.
So I guess e-sports is here to stay.
What's their highest donation total.
Last years agdq did 1.5.
So long as it regularly does 7 figures.
This year was 1.2.
About the same as the last sgdq.
SGDQ's gone up pretty significantly.
I hope they do DWB again.
It's what my grandfather said to donate to in his will.
Dwb has always been the sgdq target.
I thought it changed.
One of them altered.
Well last year was still dwb.
If they changed for next one i'm not aware.
Someone on twitter says the Bloodborne commentary is awful as well.
The blindfolded tyson was great.
Did you watch woflenstein.
It has really cool skips.
But it takes them liek 10 minutes to get one of them.
Commentary is chill as fuck tho.
Are we calling MSF DWB to avoid confusion with Metal Gear?
We're calling it that because thats their official name in english ?
I genuinely have heard it as MSF more.
MSF is also fine.
Vision% sure is GDQ.
Oh they have an indicator of which game's sound is playing.
It's still the same couch from year 1 right?
It's still the same couch from year 1 right? no.
Couch is aqcuired on site.
In ongoing boardgame movie adaptation news Russia is making a sci-fi action movie out of Mafia.
An ad in which maybe someone heard about subliminals but... myabe didn't get it?
Noelor i don't know.
I'm getting a weird impression thats a herbal essences comercial with whispering.
I think its working.
The one at the end is A+.
ChaosSmurf from a discussion of FF7's episodicness and paying multiple times for a game At least I'm paying $250 for a story better than something Chris Metzen did...
Its a pretty simple corruption plotline when it comes down to it.
MoonWolf Vorgen updated O.
MoonWolf how was the Diablo.
I liked it anyway.
Twitch VODs seem a bit more stable.
The Pokeglitch exhibition is glorious.
Yeah this seems about right UT spoilers for Ana still I think.
Omg MoonWolf these cute transhumanist lesbians are so cute -.
Further UT spoilers Papyrus.png.
Fourth exalted game in the end one person is missing an arm two people have been impaled by the remaining players spear and he is dying from a crushed ribcage.
Also must create a kingdom ruled by a prinsess who has one weapon of mass destruction.
Call her mononuke hime.
GlennCuttlefish finished Veteran difficulty on my summoner.
Let me tell you.
Log'somethingsomething is BULLSHIT on a summoner.
Because your minions just don't want to hit the bastard.
And even if they do.
Only one of them fits inside of the little niche you can actually hit him in.
If it was american cops it would read After 911 call about a woman with hypoglycemia two policemen shot womans dog confiscated five kids dinner.
Obviously spoilers but even more of everyone's favourite characters!
Papyrous for what i hope is understandable reasons is not my favourite character.
Papyrus is the best character right after toriel tbh.
I know I was already hooked on SW7 but seeing it imax 3d today really blew me away.
In a good place right now.
Also that last one is 100% accurate except for the number of arms I guess.
Noelor you've seen the temmie to colege video right.
Just from in-game or?
...I found a series of remixes in the Temmie soundfont.
I will find it.
Anime runtimes keep getting more bullshit.
It is probably the first result for temmie on youtube.
I thought this anime might fill my bullshit cutesy slot for this season episode runtime? 2 minutes.
The opening alone is 25% of an episode.
It is the second result.
I saw this before I played the game.
And didn't get it at all.
Played it saw it again in the same place and nearly died.
This seems like the sort of thing I should blame Tarquin for somehow.
Though with the 1.1 million views probably woulda seen it eventually.
Also with this rap its worth it to listen to the lyrics at least once.
It was a good rap song even before the temmie remix.
ChaosSmurf 747 full of women and cigars get money.
Did he say something about a floor made of scalps?
...and teaching robots how to love?
Not sure about that one.
Is Metaton meant to be a chick.
Their gender is being fabulous.
But I have been surprised by that interpretation multiple times.
People seem to think the main character's a dude so.
The game goes out of its way to only They you.
I just thought they were a girl.
From the first time I saw the spirte.
Yeah here we go.
ChaosSmurf Mettaton is male.
As assigned by Alphys anyway.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
All the female interps are A+++ tho so I'm okay with it.
Breakfast burgers for dinner living the life.
GlennCuttlefish did you see my anger about the last boss of Grim Dawn ?
GlennCuttlefish>> it's breakfast in australia.
Havent tried him as summoner yet.
It isn't teaching robots how to love.
It's how to LARP.
Did you look at the lyrics ?
That I just linked.
And having listened while reading LARP sounds righter.
>Jet Ski made of wine.
This is the best song every written.
Here's a Temmie-less version if that's somehow something you want?
Noelor not really but i'll give it shot.
That was a thing.
I'm so glad to be alive.
Living is pretty rad state to be in.
Have you seen the top comment on those lyrics Noelor.
Noelor having read the verse.
Still think it should be larp.
Some of the comments say it's love when they do it live.
Still think it's larp in the video.
DUHN DUHN DUH-DA-DUHN DA-DUHN-DUNH.
Guess i'll have to invite the witch doctor in again to drive that out of my head now.
This is in fact how you should defeat undyne the first time.
None of this running away.
Just shouting about how anime isn't real.
How would you even know at that point.
Omg imagine if you could do that on post-pacifist playthroughs though.
I started a game of CivBE the other night.
It's somehow still bugged.
At least I hope it was a bug.
I got to a pretty good place I thought allied with everybody on the map except Koslov because he was my neighbour and also Koslov.
Then Koslov and Élodie declared war on Barre which meant I had to declare war on Koslov and Élodie.
Then the next turn one of my allies declared war on another of my allies which meant I ended up at war with all 6 other nations.
So I shut the game down.
Is that with the expansion.
Specifically the expansion in fact.
Â£25 well not-spent by me.
Because you couldn't iirc ally in the base game.
Certainly not to that extent.
What a fucking waste.
They now won't do it again.
Next civ will be ordinary civ.
It's pretty cool otherwise imo.
The base game was p. garbage tho.
Though it was far from great.
Well the problem really is how good Civ 5 was.
After an extra 3 years of dev.
And tonnes of mods.
Though I really don't get why CivBE wasn't build on top of that.
Instead of on top of something even less featured and functional than base 5.
Or base 4 from what i remember.
Unless you mean literally as another expansion.
I'm not sure I understand.
BE is pretty clearly based on 5.
Yeah but it doesn't have all the systems or subtleties.
Which I udnerstand some of because SPACE.
The biggest problem was the other leaders being complete enigmas because they were fictional and not as obviously or explicitly niche as and this is a comparison they more than invited Alpha Centauri's.
Like I played enough to know that I never wanted to start near Koslov or Rejinaldo but the more diplomatic ones were just ¿¿¿???
This was fixed in the expansion.
They just somehow made the fix with some stupendously huge bugs.
And in a way that people have different complaints about eg not being able to deliberately give more than you need to to someone.
ChaosSmurf please explain.
Great now I have to get up to Stockholm at some point to visit the comic store a friend on skype just pointed out to me.
What's in this stockholm comic book shop then?
It's just that I've missed it completely whenever I was there so.
Have a South Korean Les Mis tribute.
Yakuza 3 is turning out better than I expected.
You have reasonable temperatures again.
Do you know what my stupid fucking brains first thought was when I read it this morning was? Sarah will be really upset fucking brains |.
Also hasn't agdq ended?
Its still in the channel title.
God you had _one_ job MoonWolf.
I need to watch the archives later I missed Mirror's Edge.
ME is already uploaded.
Is it easy to find or just yeah its somewhere inside this 4 hour video ?
Similar to what my game looks like when I play it - whooshing with very satisfying sounding explosions.
Does it also have a rock-ish version of canon in d ?
No I didn't listen to the audio in the video because work.
Now I want to though.
Its fun I know everything around me is about to die whenever my game skips a frame or two p.
Games shouldn't skip a frame or two.
Even when there is suddenly 6 giant blue explosions to render?
I really wish I had one of these.
I'm sure you can get one for the extortionate price of like multiple times what you've earned in total in the games lifetime.
There is a necklace I want for my build that only dropped in a previous league but you can get it you open a map with a certain modification.
So its like 16+ex.
I've had 1ex so far this league and I spent it already.
Grimgar is a pretty good anime first episode anyway emphasis on the Pretty.
Its really really good looking.
So it has more than 5 frames of animation per second?
But it also has really nice backgrounds.
I really like well done anime backgrounds.
One of the best bits about FMAB >_>.
What the fuck.
That instrument is mental.
Garnet's backstory was so 3.
All of it or just the first episode of the bomb ?
Yay we can talk about spacerocks.
This kazoo version of bonetrousle has grown on me.
Anathema it's easy to find on the YT channel.
And the ME run is fucking incredible so I'd recommend it.
MoonWolf GDQ need to make a press pack with all the photos they post on twitter.
ChaosSmurf tell them not me.
I can't make them do stuff.
ChaosSmurf sweet I'll check it out tuesday then arrpee tonight.
And I literally have no clean dishes left so I gotta do that before the game >_>.
MoonWolf I didn't realise Long War was out of beta o.
Only bugfixes happened.
Has it not been forever.
If I just.... install it over my current one...
How fucked will my campaign be?
ChaosSmurf it's been in beta forever.
Do they have an announcement psot.
It mentions a report from nexus forums.
I didn't realise it was two weeks back bit old now maybe.
I'd give the mod a shot if I wasn't on XCOM-starvation while waiting for 2.
Are they not the best.
X-COM was released on linux?
Damn it was and so is x-com2.
That is really cool.
Ew/eu was released on EVERYTHING.
That it could run on.
Its on either andriod or ios.
One of those not sure which.
The sequal is PC only though?
EU is on both android and ios apparantly wow.
Out on basically anything it can be.
I tried X@COM the XCOM roguelike while at Noelor's its boss. By the guy doing Cogmind.
Have you guys seen these sectopod videos.
Because oh my god.
I'm not watching anything so it is fresh when I do decide to play it.
Yeah I wish I had that luxury right.
Because this thing is shitting terrifying.
Anathema imagine a regular sectopod different paint job but it can turn into a war of the world tall walker when i twants too.
Also it has a billion HP.
Are there better vids than these ones on the millenium dailymotion somewhere MoonWolf ?
And its changed its barrage abality for a giant fuckoff laser.
ChaosSmurf not that i know about.
I don't want to live on this planet any more.
I can't remember what a sectopod looks like I only played XCOM without the expansion and it wasn't very good so I didn't get very far.
Man I REALLY hope they've left some stuff in reserve.
Whatever's past that 2-month barrier must be incredible.
ChaosSmurf well i'm sure we're going to fight ethereals at SOME point.
So those are going to be in.
I guess we haven't seen ether- yeah.
And then there will be the general unit upgrades.
Muton elites heavier droids etc.
There's some of the super-advent in that video.
Can your guys in robot suits punch the aliens?
I'm hoping the models for EW aliens are available in the modding tools.
Assuming you can get robot suits again.
If not that someone makes them available.
So we can put in packs of old sectoids.
Anathema there are no robo-suits in the base game.
I believe both games are unreal.
So assuming the mod tools are as good as they're saying.
They have a dlc that most people think will be robo-suits though.
It should be fairly easy.
Thats out later this year.
Is that the one with the humongous spoiler in its name.
People have already ripped the XCOM aliens for SFM so I imagine if they arent available in 2 they will be.
If nobody else does i will make the attempt.
Buff sectoids are all well and good.
But i want tiny sectiods too.
Did you see the pic of one lying like PAINT ME LIKE ONE OF YOUR FRENCH GIRLS.
That model is /weird/.
And all the old robot units.
ChaosSmurf the ragdoll physics are TOP NOTCH.
Have they confirmed what happened to cryssalids.
Did they become faceless?
If not CAN'T WAIT FOR THOSE.
I'M SURE THEY WON'T BE AWFUL.
They are a little different.
Have they been on streams etc.
There was an article.
They don't zombie people anymore.
Instead they create eggs.
Yeah I remember seeing these and being kinda disappointed.
Taht hatch into more.
Three new Chryssalids will emerge.
They're the zerg now.
Twitch managed to break video controls in chrome...
Websites are hard OK.
I realised that not only does our site regularly crash shockwave.
But it runs better once shockwave has crashed.
Anathema on the side of The Man o.
MairBear on the side of fuck you you stupid browser render my goddamn code correctly for once.
Surely the browser is the one that decides what correctly is.
Much like working in retail makes you hate all of humanity being a programmer makes you hate all software.
MoonWolf I think our site layout is good but what we do with it is p. bad.
ChaosSmurf the browsers don't agree on what correct is.
We're not PC Gamer but the ads are a bit OTP.
ChaosSmurf no there are standards documents that dictate what correct is.
And the standard specifies a 5th slightly different thing that should happen.
Not very good standards if nobody listens v.
WELCOME TO TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS.
Man the chicken soup i made last night is even better for lunch.
I'm glad all I have to abide by is the clear and simple rules of the english language.
Please explain how to semicolon in 1 single sentence.
Lists sentence splits or something else I don't remember.
Or the end of a statement.
Otherwise your paragraph wont compile!
Oh wow we have actual web developers employed somewhere at brady.
Anathema and you learned this after being there for two years?
Yeah because they just announced a new version of the corporate website.
So about saving that Â£1.7mil..
I guess the website revamp has been going on for a while thought -.
Its really slow to load.
It looks like someone took a bootstrap template and used some animation js blerghs on it.
Homepage is a 1.4mb.
And sent a big bill.
Ftrbzzs that is basically it.
I could've done that.
And made it smaller.
Lots of stuff isn't cached.
Also their twitter is still just as bad as before.
90% of css rules are unused.
They haven't done anything to understand how to use the different social media channels they supposedly interact in.
Does it have the full bootstrap css?
It does.. doesn't it.
I think it is at least minimised.
Oh wow it isn't.
Flying pixel web design.
Just send them that as a response.
That would probably be considered rude p.
Guess I was wrong when I said we have actual web developers here though.
I think the whole thing has been just ordered from an agency.
The mobile navigation menu is also a bit poor.
Anathema just what we needed in life.
Caffiene in more things.
My space muffins needed an extra kick!
Two weeks until Burns Night I better get a proper haggis sorted.
Anathema can I get haggis too?
Do you know what the eta on people giving up on burns night is.
And teaching bannockburn in schools.
Ftrbzzs ask your local butcher.
I need to find a local Scotsman to ask.
ChaosSmurf go back tae yer ain country.
I'm just hoping to cure the rowdy locals of their self-importance beforehand.
You actually mean being a cultural imperialist.
We could have learned something useful in history instead.
Like the american civil war.
Or literally anything else that happened before now.
Haggis is alright though so Burns Night can stay I guess.
Well that was short lived.
You need to do history at standard grade for the cool stuff like WWI and the Weimar Republic and the rise of Hitler.
I don't remember what we learned.
I think the garbage Scottish stuff was first year.
I never did any Scottish history at secondary school either that or I have forgotten it all equally likely.
We did shit loads.
Wallace and that other chap.
And the four battle sthey fought three of which they lost.
Gee wizz not closing off an does horrible things to a website.
What did you expect would happen.
I didn't expect all the furniture to disappear.
I would have assumed our content wrapper is seperate from the stuff that controls the sidebar and so on.
But seperate just means its wrapped in a and a css file moves it around.
Things fuck up if there is a giant part of the page that is supposed to contain a different page and the browser has no idea to close it or where to end it and now becuase of that how to move it around.
I would have also thought that stuff had protection coded in so I couldn't so totally fuck it.
New shirt in the mail today. WOo.
Its a pretty good name.
XCOM 2's Sectopod is bigger than a house has about a billion HP and will kill Sid Meier if you let it.
ChaosSmurf sure is writing headlines.
Cooked_Auto that thing is magic.
ChaosSmurf if you are here.
There was one line in that article that was just weird to me.
Let me find it.
Millenium return to show that that's all wishful thinking. <- Either this is some advanced reference i don't get.
I don't remember the exact context.
But Millenium are the name of the site that was posting the stuff.
So they're returning with another video below to show that all of the stuff that I wrote before that line is wishful thinking.
Which if I remember was a bunch of stuff about maybe the sectopod isn't so bad.
It still feels really weird to me.
It's not the best line of all time but gibberish might be a little harsh.
Hey you're the man of absolutes.
But now you're all about the nuance.
So he want from a Sith to a Jedi? P.
Cooked_Auto this is great nonsense.
Stop hating science MoonWolf >.
What am I listening to.
Then it is so simplified as to have become meaningless.
Well it was from a training video.
The fucking griffon screech in that WC trailer.
That is really frickin' cool.
ChaosSmurf The Strategy King is on Daft Souls this week for an XCOM2 special and I hope it was recorded recently enough.
I'd like to point out that Mal'Ganis just said 'Only Death to sing the tale of your doom'. Somebody wrote that and voice acted it. thanks Metzen.
It was recorded the day before the embargo lifted I think.
Or the day it did.
I'm half-way through and it's quite good.
I was looking into fixes for the bug in CivBE that put me at war with everyone.
Turns out when it launched the bug was actually that your allies never went to war with you.
So they made it the opposite?
Sure glad they fixed it so allies always help you in war!
They made it the opposite.
I almost drowned in warhammer swimming across the river away from like 20 beastmen.
I think the fix might be to never fully ally with anyone.
That way I never have to go to war.
The dwarf and the bretonian stood to fight.
They seem dumber than you.
Yeah I'm surprised they aren't dead.
One of the beastmen was on fire.
One was a wizard.
I'm standing on the opposite bank praying for them.
What armour were you swimming in?
Leather jack and a mail vest.
Noelor I would but the Beastmen are faster our horses were on the other side and there is nowhere here to hide.
There are people keeping them busy for you!
Don't waste their lives!
I'm hoping the beastmen can't swim too.
I mean maybe the one who's on fire might be put out but.
Both beasts and men are well known for swimming.
Oh man they killed the guy on fire.
The dwarf died the wizard beastman spat acid at him and melted his arm off.
Yeah that'd do it.
Omfg bretonian charged and killed the wizard.
Earlier the dwarf hit him was 1pt off killing him it seems.
I saw dead he just spent a Fate point to heroically hang on to life.
Also the bretonian was on fire because of the giant beastman.
He fell into the river after the fight on 0 wounds.
Huh that's some interesting VA choices.
Wukong is voiced by Goku's VA. This makes far too much sense.
Yeah that one's just obvious.
Oh gods. Teemo is voiced by Pikachu's VA.
Oh gods no 2 is just the perfect choice.
Hah even Saber is in it.
The bretonian went insane.
Also this is the bretonian we had to cut the arm off of because he was wearing a cursed gauntlet.
You aren't dead at 0 wounds.
At 0 wounds you start taking critical hits which are things like your arm is cut off.
They fled after the shaman died.
I failed 3 57% medicine rolls.
Maybe don't try to medic from the other side of a river.
Don't try to medic while covered in infected river water.
I sterilsed myselfwith vodka.
I sterilsed myselfwith vodka <- ooookaaaay.
Is there vodka in the warhammer setting?
Just seems a very specific means of alcohol production that doesn't quite mesh with medieval european fantasy.
Probably just a killjoy...
P sure muscovites have an equivalent in WH.
For what I assume is the final fight it seems I bought 4 health potions 2 knuckledusters a chainmail 2 handbags and 4 tunas.
Kislev totes make vodka and Warhammer is really more early modern era / renaissance.
Wat Florida passed a law saying children can do programming to get foreign language credits.
Or were you being sarcastic?
My amazon orders in 2015 coffee books guitar crap weight lifting crap.
I got nice coffee today for the first time in a while.
Not silver oak but still good.
What did you get?
Mountain blend from the guy in the market on saturdays.
Majority of them are light just over half is a light columbian.
Anathema you know we counted how many coffee brewing methods we have at home and I think we got 5.
And I feel like we're still missing something.
Oh sorry it's 6.
Espresso clever dripper aeropress cafetiere pour-over?
What did I miss?
Espresso clever dripper aeropress v60 pour-over our new filter coffee pot.
I missed something now too.
Oh the little pot that's both for tea and coffee brewing.
I still want a coffee syphon because playing with gas burners is great fun.
Guy opened a PR based on me complaining on twitter o_0.
To paraphrase imgur comments I feel I'm too poor to even look at that dessert.
MoonWolf SA forums are back up again btw.
Anathema guild wars blog at 515.
There will be one.
Do you know what it iwll be about?
It's 4 sides of A4 long.
I thought I saw Sophie Turner in the that still from xman apoc didn't realise she was playing Jean Gray.
Her one line in the trailer is abysmal.
Haven't seen it hopefully she is good in the movie though.
Mairnai so i looked stuff up and apparantly you can make a melee wizard in d3 now with the delsere set.
So going to make one of those for the new season.
If it... ever... starts.
MoonWolf Friday I think?
It's an event happening in January so I assume it is this weekend.
That would have made sense if they dropped the patch today.
ChaosSmurf ff7lp is probs actually finished now btw.
Elentor was working on an epilogue but is super duper sick.
Is he going to die.
He nearly did the other day apparently.
I'll link the post when I get home.
It's probably bad that I wasn't planning to visit my brother this year but now I've remembered it's Pokémon's 20th anniversary I want to go see him so I can be in Japan this year.
Its a little bad.
Luckily last post of the thread.
So I don't have to read the rest of the thread.
And can pretend I'm original when I say This LPer are sick.
This morning a number of new PokÃ©mon-related items were announced or reiterated. Thereâ€™s going to be a PokÃ©mon Super Bowl ad. Thereâ€™s a new PokÃ©mon TCG game expansion. More PokÃ©mon Amiibos are coming. A dozen PokÃ©mon movies are coming to streaming services. And of course the 3DS is getting digital download versions of PokÃ©mon Red Blue and Yellow in February.
Build a bear workshop tie-in re-release of first set tcg chain distributions of more legendaries for gen 6.
Like there's a cycle gonna go through mew victini keldeo shaymin wankers like that.
Please don't watch anime about 6-year-olds seducing their teachers. That's weird.
Noted. And at the same time I pretty much know what show its referring to.
You're not my mom |.
If I want to watch loli deluxe senpai seduction I will!
Doom mods get stranger as they go.
Soooo which show is it?
That is how fists work.
I fire my hands to get the sugar for my tea all the time.
MoonWolf Geert Wilders' Party For Freedom PVV now the largest party in dutch polls by far. how true is that and how terrible are the consequences?
Not important right now.
Also whenever someone is the largest party right now.
We mean out of 10 parties that get seats and 5 or 6 that can actually get big.
They are in the lead by 2 or 3 seats.
Not what the british might think as in if there was an election right now they would have a majority on their own.
Because we have more than 2 or 3 viable parties.
And our goverements are coalitions.
Anathema any other questions ?
If they have the plurality would they be in an easy state of acquiring allies to form a majority?
Or are they all on their lonesome.
They could but wilders is a but of a populist asshole.
So its quite possible the second largest parties would bypass him if they can find a way to agree on issues.
Also and this is important.
Pvv is great at being opposition.
But they almost always fall in ratings when campaigning starts.
And they have backstabed a goverment twice now.
Once by aborting talks and going NOPE.
Forcing it to fall.
Other political parties do not like that.
That was when we had a minotiry goverment relying on PVV support for critical issues.
They were in talks because the goverment had some serious disagreements with well itself really.
When the pvv pulled out it was over.
<- d3 mercy wings looks PRETTY GOOD.
They look way too big.
Never go full Aion.
To me they look like someone took a smaller model and blew it up in size.
Is that in regard to Greymane or Mercy's wings?
Well it seems unlikely.
Well yes but they still look off.
OW's textures and models are almost certainly much better more detailed than D3's.
I think what you're seeing is just y'know.
And if OW is their cartooniest game D3 is probably the least so.
So it's the biggest style clash possible?
I mean I know its not an import like so.
Hearthstone cartooniest I'd argue.
MoonWolf thanks I got distracted by path of exile.
Quote board at work has ended up on Bowie week mode.
And I've been tasked with tomorrow's quote.
And I hate this because I cling onto the melancholy quotes.
Or some of the 70s early queer/androgyny icon stuff.
Which... don't think is what was in mind when I was asked?
Five Years includes the lyrics Cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest / And a queer threw up at the sight of that.
Lady Stardust is literally a song idolising glam rock stars that refers to them like drag queens.
Take a break from the bowie and also the music references i guess.
See if I'd just been asked for a quote yes.
I was asked for a Bowie line.
I take issue with this CAH answer card.
Because Ziggy Stardust moves *like* a tiger on *vaseline*.
Â€œWait is that crazy ass heavy metal album aeon thing Seymour's frikkin' MOM!?â€ haha.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish.
I should sleep and I am tired but I dont wanna.
2317 and I hate this because I cling onto the melancholy quotes <--- go with one its what they get for asking you to pick!
The patch notes are assembled from cryptic commit notes of tens of thousands of small changes that often contradict each other. It takes over a week literally to put them together. o_0.
Listening to the 13A LP.
Level 8-9 sorcerer does a chain lightning attack.
Rolls a bunch of dice.
Give me a minute to work out the math.
1248 damage to the mooks.
They're probably all dead.
They in fact are.
That was five misses two hits and a crit after charging up.
I weep at the people suggesting a better trading system be implemented if the trading system is better there will be no flippers because selling at market price will be so easy.
Its like they never played D3 at release.
People are doing the same things already.
PoE all the issues of having a auctionhouse.
None of the convenience of having one!
Not all of the issues.
The bigger issue would be people selling random rares worth maybe 1c which atm a lot of people wont bother picking up at all since in maps you only have a limited number of portals and dying will use one up.
Why is it an issue that people are trying to make money with rares ?
The issue is what it does to the game.
Ie D3s why bother playing the harder areas when I can get gold from the easier areas and just buy the better gear.
Or do you think D3 should have kept the AH?
No it was good they took it out.
Because that is actually a logical conclusion to make.
If this is a system that is available.
I should use it.
So therefor i should sell anything remotly good that i don't need.
This is the reasonable and logical thing to do.
I can't get angry at people doing that only the developer for making it a good option.
Do you think PoE should have an AH since it has trading?
If it wants to have trading it should facilitate trading.
So as it stands now yes.
I'd rather they move more towards D3.
Then what it is now.
While i get incredibly annoyed at the fact i can't give my friends cool items in D3.
Overall its much much better.
I would rather not.
I still get excited when a unique drops I don't want to lose that.
Hm did not expect that to happen. Foobar controller for android has unexpected abilities.
So today I got a call from the unemployment agency and in amazingly they did their fucking job and asked me about a job offer they have. For a teacher in German. When at best I can say simple phrases and forgotten 99% of what I learned 10+ years ago v.
Time to do some writing.
Hours and hours of megalovania.
Well half an hour.
Because that's my lunch break.
Someone asked what the name is for meat from a sheep too old to be lamb but too young to be mutton.
Turns out it's hogget because fuckin' English.
Are they secretly a sphinx?
But also on the way to that question Google autofill thought I might be looking to search for Between labia majora and labia minora.
TIL there is a name for young adult sheep meat.
Which is a really specific thing for that few letters imo.
Tavern brawl back in 5 hours.
What did they do this time.
Mairnai EU is just permanenatly later these days.
To that I say bah!
Welp I'm fucked p.
Oh god why would anyone do this. Somebody just favorited a post of mine on this forum.
I will now go commit sudoku for all the cringe I am feeling.
MoonWolf diablo 3 confuses and befuddles me.
It's telling me new patch is live I thought we were getting it later. And the game refuses to actually... patch it.
I launched 2.4 this morning.
Try restarting the battle.net client.
It's not getting past authenticating so I'm scanrepairing.
While i wait though...
What am I gonna play this time x.
Crusader did not work no sir.
I'm making a wizard.
Since the slow time set now has spectral blades as a thing on it.
Behold the slightly different buff bars.
And fancy new wings if you pre-ordered titan.
You get mercies wings.
Almost worth buying the game for.
Why didn't I get anything for playing hearthtitan yet? c.
I want a fucking HS d3 thing.
Jesus christ how adorable.
Mairnai 3 more hours for my fucking free pack a week such bullshit.
The best part of a new season.
Spending the first hour tidying up bags.
Also note the little legendary power diamond works differently now.
If its empty you have not cubed it.
If its filleda different colour its cubed.
If its solid it can't be cubed.
I read that as a different colour is cubed.
Yeah cube legendaries now have colours.
Can you collect all 6 colours of every item ?
You get an acheievement.
MoonWolf I'm gonna astound you.
And make a demon hunter.
But are you astounded.
It'll be easier to do the speedrun conquest at least.
Yeah most of my reasoning is... I want to actually be able to do damage this time.
And you're taking wizard and I hate filling the screen with whirlwinds.
I want to try filling the screen with whirlwind one day.
Huh you can embedd tweets and webms on SA now.
But webms are automatically muted.
This was desparately called for.
Could be neat for LPs vOv.
Better quality than gifs.
>requiring LPers to record webms instead of just polsying a YouTube.
Could be for stuff that's pointless to be uploaded on YT. Just short stuff.
Someone else will have YouTubed it.
Is more my point.
Game is going to start late.
30 minute maybe 45.
Robot wars is back has more upvotes on /r/uk than david bowie has died XD.
Ready to go now when everyone has assembled.
Well Dob one of those things happened today and the other on Monday.
Sorting by top > this week.
....Bloodborne has finnish subs?
Pyramid heads weapon is not that good to begin with and they even got the wrong version P.
There are frag videos for pretty much everything I see.
Dog shaped robot buddy!
Also it is snowing today.
We have regular old boring rain here.
GlennCuttlefish alas I'm disregarding your advice for Blazblue but mostly because there's a 60% off sale on PSN store...
Huh that's pretty cool BB still has .... hours to go for the download. But 10% in it lets me start up and play all the basic tutorials.
Like the blizzard stuff ?
Yeah I can't adjust any options beyond the basic every single thing other than tutorial is greyed out. And it only lets me play as Ragna.
But if I had a slightly better internet the game would most likely finish installing while i was still half through them.
Plus good to do them anyway.
Also it only took 80 mins and a loss with mechazod at 1 hp.
But I cleared the brawl.
I went through two partners that just afked after 2 turns.
Happy New Year! -Cancer Jan 2016.
This week cancer has killed both David Bowie and Alan Rickman.
Both at age 69.
Wait Rickman died ?
Jan sure is a good month!
What was even the the point of agdq?
Because there is no such thing as defeating cancer.
MoonWolf is the new season confirmed yet.
Season 5 - starting on January 15th Friday 5PM PDT Americas 5 PM CEST Europe and 5 PM KST Asia - brings a completely revamped Season Journey. There are no more seasonal Legendary items but players will have access to other exclusive items like cosmetic rewards like Pennants Pets and Wings!
Not sure where the source is though.
Delay a week imo v.
Broke stuff after my boss asked are you sure this wont break things.
MairBear which part of my advice are you disregarding.
Glenn Buying it on PC. Will most likely still get Guilty Gear for PC though.
Pretty sure I said I wasn't sure about the quality of the PC port to begin with since I haven't tried the blazblue ones on PC.
GG indeed rocks more literally than most games as well.
The instant kill theme in GGxrd is one of the best pieces of music in any video.
So the main theme of the game.
Its even better with engrish.
Its odd guilty gear is one of my favorite fighting series but I am so bad at it.
Loved smashing away in GG can't say I was ever any good but just liked the game.
29hours remaining on download time... I need to see if I can encourage the PS4 to use a bit more of my bandwidth o.o.
Yeah hoping it's that.
But it honestly could just be my internet x.

Flurries my ass =I.
Whatever floats your boat Cooked_Auto.
Werewolf Captain American is fucking rad.
Well todays pizza experiment turned out awesome. Possibly because I had no hand in making the dough. Still need to learn that part it seems.
The dough is always the worst part.
I still havent mastered it myself.
Aokana verdict Strike Witches minus anything of significance 'on the line' with slightly less lewd outfits.
Erased also looks pretty good from what I've seen it's J name is quite long-winded and I don't recall it.
This season looks bad imo.
Only thing I've seen so far that has come as a positive surprise is ojisan to marshmallow.
This is one situation you wont noelor yourself out of.
Noelor's a verb now huh.
I need this game in my life.
Oh it is the time that it is.
By way of hopefully explaining buttness I am just now going to bed after completing the uni assignment I've been trying to complete for the last week.
!note Noelor considering that today a d3 season starts i'm okay with this course of events.
Ok guess it's just ana who'll be disappointed then.
As I also got a message from Janos overnight saying he's ended up at his parents'.
Awww no game? D.
You can diablo instead!
I might join you actually if I can maintain consciousness when I get home this evening.
Though I'm sure you'll both be 70 by then.
Helck is a good manga.
Noelor its not THAT fast.
Noelor although from the time yo went to sleep.
Maybe just go to bed ?
It is that fast let's be honest.
Especially with 2-3 people.
ChaosSmurf sure but i'm not that fast.
I think I did it in 6 hours without trying.
Anyway I'll get to play next week so that'll be good.
I'm on mumble for a bit until I have to go to work if anyone wants a wee chat.
Don't really have time for that right now.
Poop no game? oh well.
Took the morning off ?
Yeah was gonna be work night out last night but it got moved.
So ~I got my haircut instead.
Was considering going into town and getting the tattoo i want done but I cannot decide on where to get it.
I kinda wanna get the finger tats that the guy who's making unravel has.
They're a bit ~edgy~.
MoonWolf is it 5 hours or 6 till season?
4 hours 45 minutes.
There is a timer on diablofans.
You are actually about x11 more likely to find a Mirror of Kalandra in one monster kill than you are to win the Powerball. lol.
Mirror of Kalandra is the rarest item in PoE.
The odds of a single player finding two mirrors in Path of Exile is roughly equivalent to the odds of a meteor landing on your house.
Ftrbzzs have some more p.
Anathema I'd say it's hardly surprising that mental fatigue has an impact on your physical body as well.
But great to see a study on it as well.
Aye nice to have it confirmed.
Psychosomatic disorders have been around for a while.
Though not sure how seriously various doctors take psychosomatic symptoms.
1 hour to diablo time... and my middle mouse button starts to act up xD.
It only starts at 4/5?
I will defs join y'all then.
Ah yah. Cool cool cool. o.
Should we wait for you to get home?
It'll be a couple hours.
What is happening in diablo a new season?
New patch hit on tuesday new seasons strikes on the hour.
Can you pastebin me the patch notes?
Someone else already did.
I identify with this comic a lot.
Anytime i catch any MTG on twitch.
Its just flicking cards forever.
I'm sure MoonWolf will love it =D.
Anathema I haven't played since before seasons were even a thing so it'll all be new to me.
I love it anytime i cna play with other people.
That's fine you're allowed to like things I don't p.
I mean I might play for a bit to be social.
I swear I'm forgetting a class.
Wizard Valla Nazeebo Sonja Johanna.
6th class? Or is it really only 5?
Monk wiz barb temp dh wd.
They need to get Wizard into HotS so I can make that joke properly.
I think I'll play barb or crusader.
Are either of them looking particularly good/bad/synergistic with y'all's plans this season?
Both would be about as good.
Fall of the Moon-men.
I meant flavour of the month.
I am intrigued by this 50s scifi title.
MoonWolf is allegedly playing melee wizard.
Go ranged crusader to complement.
...Is that a thing.
I'd do throw-barb or bow-sader or w/e.
Not yet at any rate.
Johanna only gets a grand total of 2 talents for her E.
I don't like Johanna.
Thought you said Sonja.
And see Spear of the Ancients is great and has good talents.
One of the dudes from the Exterminatus Now webcomic has gotten a gig with White Dwarf.
Worksafe but somewhat mind boggeling.
Yet fascinating as well.
Hi I'm Darth Vader I just dropped by on top of my TIE Fighter to ruin your day.
When I got on the bus about 30 minutes ago pretty sure the billboard showed -10.
MoonWolf T2 Kulle is hilariously straightforward with my 2 piece bonus. If you want a boost to mow him down just let me know.
Like adorable future lesbians with music.
MairBear the replacement of stunning in xcom 2.
Just a heads up the January 2016 Chipod Ironicast recording is tomorrow at 830pm GMT 330 eastern 1220 pacific. This month the live audience will be public and open to all so I hope you can all join us. It's a youtube stream so I don't have a url just yet but I'll be sure to share one as soon as it exists on many sites and social media platforms.
And itâ€™s launching fireworks that spell out â€œCOME HERE XCOM. HUMANS WELCOME. Hi Cam!â€ Damn it Speedball. ^^.
>laying plot hooks for an XCOM 2 LP.
Noelor when might you want D3?
After I've read this LP update and nuked some food.
Careful or it'll ghoul.
Nah it'll just be ghoulash.
Or it could collapse.
Oh yes a Devil's Third LP.
Huh this sounds interesting.
Yes Vampires Dawn. Not as one would assume Vampire's Dawn or Vampires' Dawn. Not the dawn of a particular vampire or the dawn of vampires in general but it is the vampires themselves that do the dawning... somehow.
Okay points for that OP.
Cooked_Auto otoh Argate no longer has his Navi avatar.
Lemme guess Argate transferred to... Cloud 9? F.
Been in that fb grp for a lonnnnng time I probs will recognise some of these.
Oh hey it's that guy from my college who won us UC.
I'm not convinced 33's stock photo is that of Robinson College's bar.
Or that 28 was taken at Churchill.
Really? but Buzzfeed are such paragons of journalistic integrity.
The Devils Third thread is off to a great start.
Noelor Navi is Ivan backwards Shocking revelations abound in this LP.
EDF! EDF! EDF!
My computer room has been running two computers and had the heating on the past few hours now at a whopping 17C.
I may need to move house this summer.
Whaaat there's a GITS fps in the works.
Its been out for a while.
Its apparently so and so.
With it being a multiplayer team shooter.
First OC character is getting added soon.
Cam does get cold winters ana and you are heat-sinking into single digits.
Also found out why firebirds felt so shit.
The 6pc is bugged currently it only counts as burning if the full 3000% burn is on the enemy which is why it nearly only activates on elites rares and rift bosses and makes the set nearly useless for normal mobs because they die before you can get the 25% damage buff.. The second bug is that if you don't kill the minions of a rare mob you keep the 600% damage buff until you kill another elite mob.
MoonWolf how's the new zone.
A nice new tilesset to play on.
Thats about it ?
They pushed it a little like it was more than that.
Its go tlore bit but i've not been going after that.
Just going there if bounties have something there.
One of these days I will learn to code.
Then I will program an app for my phone that picks up the moment I start snoring so that I will always know what time I fell asleep.
I hate these mornings when I am almost certain I slept enough but feel like crap.
Ah well since I am up now and I have a game in...Hour and a half time to start drawing up that floating city.
You can get them.
But I think they require a smart watch to measure your pulse.
I swear a mate of mine got one that measured his breathing by having the phone next to him.
I dont suppose any of you know of a manual combat tracker for ex3?
Definitely not web based.
I can see plenty of computer based ones but my windows phone is too cumbersome for those.
MoonWolf MairBear and I managed the 6-minute rift but it was tight had to ignore all items on the floor that weren't on the minimap and TP as soon as the boss was down and clear to close the rift.
Nothing new to me obviously but neat.
It is morning good is debatable.
Worst thing about Path of Exile act 4 not hearing at the end.
Just realised this week's exalted which should finally actually happen now I've got my assignment in is set in Un'Goro Crater.
Meanwhile my SR game has been put on hold for a couple of months at best because too low player count. The GM didn't want to play with three players and one coming in late due to classes.
So I got a mail today that my latest Qwertee shirt has shipped apparently via teleportation because it was in my mail box today v.
Your order should arrive between January 23rd and February 1st and no later than February 10th. v.
Exalted is a game about people going 'This time it will be DIFFERENT!' and then it not being different at all while many PCs never notice.
Gods I love this one so much.
Because tahts a thing.
That firewalls can be.
Of course are you telling me movies have lied to me?!
That I have been mislead and if not outright decieved by my choice of entertainment?!
MoonWolf you guys already done playing the new season?
Alright good I might get to play tonight.
I am however a wizard that explodes FOREVER.
Have you already tipped past the balance point.
I don't know what I want to play this go round.
Oh Demon Hunter that was it.
I have plenty more growth to grow into.
Do you have a permanent slow-time bubble?
Have they made the melee classes even nearly fun yet?
Crusader and Barbarian vs. the ranged guys is like night and day.
I am enjoying my Crusader.
But I haven't played since before season 1.
Anathema on one build i have 50.
Oh my god the Devils Third LP is three videos in and the game just goes insane.
But i have as many as i want.
Can you spawn so many bubbles you crash the instance?
I've never seen a diablo 3 instance crash.
Now the Diablo 3 *client*.
Thats crashed on me.
I think this is my third time trying to learn these rules.
Anathema mair and i are hanging out on ze mumbles if you wish you complain about d3.
GlennCuttlefish where is the rules do they explain the part where you become a super aryan ?
From a google performed while playing exalted.
Thats sure is an image.
Then I made an Undertale reference because obviously but nobody else in the game has played Undertale.
I'm sure it was a great reference though.
I just made one of my eyes glow while threatening someone with A Bad Time.
Yeah thats a bit generic ?
I mean oh no glowing eyes while being intimidating.
Not exactly an understale exclusive.
Well ana hasn't watched Genocide yet but.
It is relevant I.
MairBear anyfin can happen paladins are bullshit.
Is this working? trying to show someone my very fps unfriendly build but it says its offline?
Poe says it is streaming.
S'lying to you I guess.
Well its doing something because my fps goes down when it starts to do whatever it is doing.
PoE has twitch integration in the game client using that.
Oh well another time.
>video game art.
Kings bounty is a parody game not to be taken seriously.
It is p. Poe's Law if so.
Exalted status tried to jump onto a flying jellyfish botched.
Jumped through the flying jellyfish nearly plumetted to death.
MoonWolf holy crap the deathwing play in the latest rage orc.
I watched what Mair said and I have no idea what even.
Holy fucking fuck Life is Strange.
Life is indeed strange.
Forgot that you need to use the blacksmith a lot while doing 1-30 in D3.
So last night was not very fun.
Found a build I don't hate now though.
And have some legendaries.
Shame the DH season set is garbage.
MoonWolf do you eventually get an adventure to go get the cube.
Or do you have to just go get it.
You have to just go get it.
I didn't have my sound on but I went to the new area last night.
What're you playing as?
First 20 levels were not very fun.
Hopefully a proper one with crossbows.
But now I have vault/bat/multi-shot/strafe/some other AOE.
ChaosSmurf i have a level 30 something monk i can play with you.
I'm kinda mad cause the season set is garbage melee shit.
I think I am.
I will mumble tonight.
ChaosSmurf you get one season set.
Across your whole account.
Ignoring hc I think.
Between HC and SC.
Fuck hc I guess.
Though I guess that's the point.
So if you get the DH seasons et you can't get the barbarian one?
Assuming ther eis one for each class.
That does seem weird.
The set just drops.
Also I'd forgotten they'd added action combat and oh my lord.
It's just you only get one free set from Haedrig.
It's a proper system for the massacre bonuses and stuff.
And it has an actual timer on it.
And shows you it as it grows.
Oh its Rampage League from PoE V.
Ok that's my D3 troll for the day.
It's action combat from the console version of the game.
But yeah I'm sure it's a better version of something in PoE too.
I can't wait for Blizzard to copy Beyond next that's a fun one.
Well it will be once they're done with it yes.
No really Beyond mod is one of my favourite map mod after Fractured -.
I recognise the XCOM motto.
The second is the MEC motto the third is the gensoldier motto.
What're the other two+.
Or is it just an extended version of the motto I was hitherto unaware of.
BELLATOR IN MACHINA is the motto of MECs.
UTARE AD CUSTODIAM is the motto for gene soldiers.
<- see also the logos.
I love that the MECs get the skull explosion.
Well twitter is back up again but tweetdeck is still fucked for me mrgrgrgr.
Better than constant error reporting.
So much edge.
That skull explosion logo is a great callback.
The latin in those is probably 15 kinds of wrong.
I know the vigilo confido is.
Don't ask me how.
I don't remember latin grammar mistakes.
What's XCOM 2's motto?
ALSO GOD LESS THAN 20 DAYS TO GO.
I think you fucked the Vigilo bit guys.
Did they confirm you don't get psi-soldiers until later? I never got around to the stream about it.
Actually shit I should probably post it.
You get them by i believe disecting a section doing another research building a building then putting people in that building.
Put rookie in building get psi-trooper.
They get a selection of 3 randomly chosen abilities.
Put back in building for more abilities.
They seemed hella OP.
I guess they can't hack? What are their other disadvantages?
They are expensive in time to train and they only get to shoot gun if their stuff is on cooldown.
They hack as well as any regular soldier.
Which is shittyly and only when directly next to the thing.
Apparantly DD is out of early access officiall ynow.
I'm being informed so by Ben Barret of PCGamesN.
It's coming out today.
So you guys know Far Cry Primal.
Do you happen to have a final patch notes ?
Nope just the trailer everyone else has.
They haven't even said if it's getting one.
I assume it is.
And how Ubisoft said they weren't doing towers because y'know pre-history.
Someone at a press event just texted to say it has towers.
I am unreal mad.
Its probably something lame like.
It doens't have towers trust us.
It just has you know cliffs or something.
Rocky bit you climb on.
I hope it's made of bones.
The bones of ubisoft employees.
Ubisoft is incapable of making games that are not AssCreed at this point.
Even games that are not AC are still AC.
And that time some studio had this great game for a pirates with boat combat thing.
It still has to be AC.
Well Ubisoft Desti- I mean the Division seems nice but I'm withholding judgement and still miffed at no WiC2.
MairBear this is that total shit you were playing at Noelor's isn't it.
Did you just call etrian games shit ?
Because you just pissed of a small and dedicated part of the internet.
Mair spent literally the entire time complaining about it.
That is a newer one but the same series at least.
Was on this one.
And it's damn good! It just makes me whine!
Complaining is a sign that I care enough about a game to not just say oh bugger it nevermind.
ChaosSmurf why would far cry have towers? isn't it a shooter? I'm confused.
Anathema it has towers.
So you can find out all the local map objectives.
Welp twitter is back to being fucked again.
The error message says thanks for noticing.
And back to working now vOv.
TweetDeck otoh is still a mess.
Damn weather here I was hoping I could do some basecoating of stuff once I had finished the latest batch of posters.
...Is Bellator in Machina just supposed to be.
Fight in a robot.
Bellator in Machina is Latin for Warrior in the Machine. according to the XCOM wikia.
It's just a 100% literal description of MECs.
One of the guys I work with.
I can't help him.
You got to pick dudes up by the throat and throw them at other dudes was kinda fun.
At least it wasnt FarCry 1 vOv.
Even if it was.
You just had cool power.
Well I no longer have a reason to play that.
Well its a Korean MMO.
When is that due to come out anyway?
But what if I really need that soulless grind in my life?
Plenty of other things available for that.
Update XIII - Spooky Priest Parties Are The Best Parties Cause Spooky Priest Parties Don't Stop. Until Everybody's Dead. Haha.
Check out how bad this looks jesus.
Don't meddle with the Smedley.
ChaosSmurf its not the worst.
GlennCuttlefish if you need that just go back to real life for a bit.
If I want a soulless grind AND dont want to be a part of the system.
But you're already playing FF14 Glenn isn't that soulless grindy enough for you?
It has moogles it isn't soulless.
Not all that grindy.
I mean sure if you want to do cutting edge endgame then yes.
ChaosSmurf MairBear mumble ?
GlennCuttlefish there is always this p.
Will have to give that a try in a day or few.
Well my attempts at using the Black Desert character creation is now being foiled by its security program being halted by what I assume is either the firewall or antivirus because it nags about suspicious programs as it boots up.
The error occurs when third party program runs during the game playing. If the same error keep occurs send the xigncode.log file to support@wellbia.com. We will send an e-mail back as soon as possible for solution. gee that says so much v.
Apparently switching graphics to low fixed this.
Huh Fantasycraft lets you essentially play Groot.
Wildstar its dead.
I'd guess the ncsoft financial statements.
But i just saw this through another channel.
Presumably from this.
They're launching on Steam soon.
Don't see it working.
Fine its a deal. But on one condition You will have to fight my whole yakuza family to get to me Well at least he is up front about this none of that boring old backstabbing today.
*The PCs are talking with a Raven that can speak* PC What's your name? Raven StÃ¶Ã¶. PC Was that a name or a coughing fit? Raven Now don't you try to be funny.
Right thats yakuza 4 done with.
Lineage 1 makes them more money than GW2? o_0.
Its really popular still.
Its like the counterstrike of mmos.
I started a new routine at the gym yesterday + went to a friend's house after work so cycled an extra 10km at least.
My body was no ready.
Enjoy your muscle pain.
I am it fills me with determination!
MoonWolf Shive can't stop ship-baiting Grarah.
Its time to commit shive.
I might need to rewatch Korra.
I just figured there was a specific impulse.
Not just it being good.
Because Korra is my waifu.
Well this is certainly a time to wake up.
It is a time.
Nice fucking freezing weather.
Here its mostly bitey.
Bah. woke up too late to be at stores in time for proper alcohol. I will have to settle for beer how cruel!
Dun dun duuun.
Oh hey MoonWolf isn't a mod any more.
Rip my mod powers.
This is I think the only strip of this webcomic with comments disabled.
What a shopping trip.
Its colder than a frost witches bosom out there some asshole zombie car blocked my normal route on the hill so I had to run to the bus almost falling over in the prosess the store was out of good bread couldn't find proper sized meat package and as a cherry on top they had increased the price of my usual beer by 50%.
Seriously what the fuck was up with that car anyway it was slowly going uphill making a sound like glass breaking every 2 seconds.
Disney-esque animal people are basically halflings right? oh Gnome.
Wizards are known for two things Supreme power and zero responsibility.
Oh yeah game tonight as well. brb dinner.
Well on the positive side assuming this installation of yakuza 5 works out the rest of my night wont be too horrible.
GlennCuttlefish i feel insulted.
Like just have to fetch it brb.
Also kaunmoth did I ever recommend hadestown to you?
GlennCuttlefish I don't believe you have.
Okay here is what you do KaunMoth. One day you will just sit down look it up on youtube and listen through the album once.
That should be the one.
I really recommend listening to it all in one go since there is a story.
Noelor WoD 7d10o9h7 Seven dice hits on 7+ roll again on 9+.
Thats how a WoD roll looks for orokos.
Not sure if that can work for you guys.
I've had a quick listen and saved the playlist for later.
Woo back from my job interview at a particle accelerator.
Yay for like four and a half hours of trains on a weeknight.
Also spider is back.
Seen the HOTS news SunTiger.
It's getting the wizard.
They'll give hots the necromancre.
He was in a quest in westmarch right.
That was not the d2 one.
I tried to do the set dungeon for the DH set last night.
It was not very fun.
I helped Mair with his have lots of turrets set dungeon last night.
And I have no idea how it could be soloed.
Throw knives at things one.
This is very weird.
Blizzard haven't revealed it themselves.
Just loads of interviews around the internet.
IrcGhost I didn't realise that the gatekeeper's zombies don't die if you kill it.
That wasn't made clear in those videos.
Not sure if real or troll there have been talks recently about changing Discharge's effect and adding a mtx for it too.
ChaosSmurf the necromancer looks... bad.
Why did you do that blizzard.
This is not what necromancers are about.
If you listen to the awful razer interview.
They went through a load of iterations.
Or maybe that was in the Gamespot thing.
Basically making it be all skeletons all the time didn't really work.
I meant the visual design.
Fucking edgelorded the shit out of him.
I don't know what he looked like.
He looks pretty Blizzard now tho.
They do talk about art style stuff in the gamespot one actually.
<- the glowy guy.
And porting from the games before Blizzard put their cartoon sheen on everything.
Yeah but they maded him into a guy who duel weilds a dagger legit and a SCYTHE really blizz.
Also they made the glow green instead of blue for no good reason.
Sounds PRETTY COOL TO ME.
And also he forgot to wear his actual armor.
Those are different tweets PatternSpider.
That is all on Twitter.
They deliver the info really badly.
>if an enemy is carrying explosives they can be remoted detonated by the psi operative.
Its like throwing a grenade but more satisfying in every way.
ALSO works on corpses with explosions.
They have an ability called soul steal.
This is going to be the best game.
That does sound fun.
Slightly racist Jake Solomon is my favourite game developer.
I believe a line has been crossed and we can never look back.
Slightly racist Jake Solomon.
Thats not what i wanted to past at all xchat.
Fucking ChaosSmurf stealing my hot irc links turning them into news.
I'll have you know I saw it on twitter before I tabbed here.
I wish I had noticed yours first.
It was 2 minutes quicker than the tweet.
Still got there before any other site though.
What is the beaglerush maneuvre.
Nvm I found it on reddit.
So you just try the same build without a set and as many supporting legendaries as you can ?
Huh I'm great at maths. And I still don't hit.
Yeah so that guy just does not have a chance.
GlennCuttlefish I've listened to Hadestown start to finish and I confirm my previous report that it's really good. Thanks.
Well i'm already not anyway ?
I can't remember everything you do!
Just for reference i have 0 thrown points.
I do think you should be allowed to enhance it with thrown but whatever.
If you want to invest into high occult and also a merit just to get a weird thrown weapon.
I need to re-read Exalted tonight so I'm ready for tomorrow.
Anathema MoonWolf asked me as his ST about the thrown deal and I said yes.
He then went for Brawl anyway.
I had to think about it!
But I stand by my choice even having seen Vance's post.
It just means that choice is now at my table.
We don't use a table though.
At your table death should never be an upgrade ?
Whatever works for you ChaosSmurf.
Got feedback from my tutor for my latest assignment.
The new DC animated movie is out.
Like New52 or else!
Ok that is cool my phone is in another room charging and my PC just told me I just missed a call.
And I can send a reply via cortana here.
None of my fingers have blood anymore stupid useless gas fireplace not heating the room up.
Omfg steam my pc has been on for like half an hour and you haven't bothered to do updates yet?
ChaosSmurf how is Kingdom iyo?
Indie game on steam.
I thought it was a japanese word.
Noelor I've heard v. interesting.
But in a play it twice and then you're done way.
Oh it's in my library.
I haven't played the final build.
How much is it?
One of my DS3's has died it seems. Guess I will have to find my soldering iron tomorrow.
Ah well one pad still works onwards with yakuza 5.
Latest guilty gear character announced. I really like her design.
Actual question on reddit should there be laws mandating politically unbiased news?
So we can forever ensure our news is unbiased.
In exactly the way we prefer it to be unbiased.
Enough time to play Diablo.
10 with the soundtrack!
Should there be laws mandating politically unbiased news? <- all I know is that my gut says maybe.
Hey let's get the press not harassing ppl and hacking their phones first.
Then try and lose the opinion columns.
Ofc this is reddit so 'politically unbiased' equals sucking bernie sanders' ane jeremy corbyn's cock.
It'd be great if we could enforce some actual laws on the press.
Because its not okay if they do illegal things.
So I have finally been catching up to the latest lupin the third series.
I really like it.
Lupins wife is a great addition to the series imo.
Thorns Crusader having trouble vs Malthael.
Need an assist ?
Going to try as hammerdin.
Noelor just lemme know if you need help.
Cooked_Auto i hope your proud of your country.
Gothenburg what can you do vOv.
MoonWolf yeah ok I think I need someone who can actually do damage to Malthael =V.
Noelor give me a moment to finish watching ChaosSmurf win a HS match.
Seeking that horse for heroes are we?
Put your hands - your fins in the air! Oh Flash.
I've not watched it.
But i never got the impression that flash was very classy.
Well he is Barry Allen also known as the FLash.
ChaosSmurf Earth 2 Wells <3.
I'm like way behind.
This is quite nice.
I'm still not sure why everyone else saw Mettaton as 'sex goddess' though.
Because of the legs.
Also that animation is fucking amazing.
One of Flash's super-allies is named after a sex toy.
Could have done with more frames but every frame it did have was amazing.
In the anti-grav sports anime 'aokana' the specialist retailer is conveniently named 'Sky Sports'. Someone alert Murdoch.
MoonWolf when did they fix it so picking up a gem picks up all nearby gems?
ChaosSmurf disappointed by the lack of Who needs arms.
So in the 4 hours I've been playing yakuza 5 today I think I have done one actual mission and one proper sidequest.
Other than that its all been cab driving.
And finally done with the taxi quests.
Goddamn I love this manly macho bullshit in yakuza.
MoonWolf when did they fix it so picking up a gem picks up all nearby gems? <- last season see also the same effect for crafting materials.
Survival now grants rest bonuses. A higher Survival skill will unlock more rest bonuses or increase the strength of existing bonuses.
The end of the game Act 3 and second half of Od Nua has been revised to remove the number of trash encounters and increase their difficulty.
Adding a melee attack for pigs <--- This is important.
They're not great with bows by my understanding.
Today in EGSNP howtheinternetworks.png.
Relatedly ->.
Sort of related.
MoonWolf seems like good changes.
Apparently the British armed forces are now advertising with reverse psychology?
I like how the army is presenting itself as a way to improve yourself and make friends.
Improve yourself is probably technically true.
If we don't specify a vector.
Improve yourself also have a good chance at PTDS.
Make friends about half of them will be some level of sociopath!
When we say lifitem we mean you've got a good chance to die before you leave the miletary.
You'll get fit as hell.
You'll get fit as hell.
Does anything else really matter though?
Does the army teach you that the heaviest thing you lift is not your weights but your feels?
The army will tell you to stop talking about your feels and follow orders.
My body is still in pain lifting my arms above my shoulders is an effort.
I say still I was at the gym yesterday too.
That probably didn't help anathema.
Yesterday is why I can't lift my arms lots of shoulder / chest / triceps.
Still eating up recovery potential of your body.
A day is enough I'm just not used to this.
Maybe get more sleep.
I did a low level elemental reflect map in PoE last night my build = I crit with a low damage aoe physical skill -> lightning explosions it was tense.
Even 13% elemental reflect was near deadly and I have instant leech to counteract it.
Yeah maybe you should just not do maps like that.
Because thats begging to oneshot yourself.
I think the only reason I didn't die was Cast on Damage Taken + Immortal Call become immune to damage for .4 seconds.
IC duration is increased by consuming Endurance Charges but my spell consumes them first for EVEN MORE DAMAGE.
That would not work if you take an small hit first and then a massive one thugh.
Depends I'd need to look into the exact trigger mechanics for CoTD it is based on amount of damage taken and not hits but it probably as a cooldown.
Yeah i figure it has an internal cooldown.
Otherwise its immunity for all.
250ms cooldown in the damage counter for each linked spell DoTs dont trigger it.
Oh immortal call only protects from physical damage.
Is reflect physical magical original element or what ?
It was reflect elemental.
Maybe I was saved by my reflex to use a flask whenever IC went off then it has a very distinctive spell effect / sond.
Ah yes the fluffy meadow bass.
Very popular with kids.
Be a giant woman.
I think it'd be great.
Oh boy. Going to be one of those days.
Ps3 refuses to boot up for mystery reasons.
Now it booted up.
And I am not awake enough to figure out that the hell.
Did you give it coffee?
Well with the crisis over time to continue yakuza 5 Kiryu's smooth ride.
It wasn't made in Finland so I did not dare.
Yeah probably safer that way.
Stop being so anime cats.
Omg the tiny kitten with the purple eye =3.
I need to have all of those cats.
TIL Japan has a law against having a large waist size.
TIL i'd be breaking the law in japan by stepping off of the plane.
It's not a criminal offense to be obese but the maximum waistline for anyone 40 or older is 35.4 inches apparently.
Breaking the law means that you will at worst be required to go to counselling sessions or dietry experts.
I bet they have a license now.
But yeah the Metabo Law.
License to be fat.
I need it for my job.
Well certainly no lack of actual plot and characrerization in these games I think that cutscene took 15-20 minutes.
Its the jrpg of gta's.
I really cant see the comparison with GTA.
Both take place in modern crime world but thats about where it ends.
Don't you drive about?
No. you run everywhere unless you take the taxi.
Theres a taxi minigame in this one =.
MairBear can you read moonrunes?
Not kanji and stuff but otherwise yuh.
Anathema I can read some æ±‰å­.
That better say moon rune and not kanji.
Tried to google that.
You know when I said the taxi part was over? I lied. I went back.
Also told a pun so bad my drunken passenger sobered up.
Also in the game?
I almost accidentally cut my sideburns off. It was a close shave.
Hey look this might be working? if you want to see my epilepsy build.
Anathema its working at least.
It claims its live.
But its taking forevr to actually show shit.
Anathema this stream just isn't loading.
Say something in chat to see if I can get it in the game.
Oh its working for me now.
I had a glimmer of activity when I spoke in chat.
But then it froze again.
Oh I saw that.
Maybe it broke when I changed zone?
I see things now.
And gone again >.>.
It dies when I go into the zone.
Oh well I leveled up now time to cook dinner.
MairBear how do you feel about giving me a hand with my set dungeon ?
Anathema I lied it's 4 solar xp.
Sven Co-op Stand alone is out now.
Meanwhile in yakuza.
So you know how I mentioned spending way too much time on that dumb taxi minigame?
I progressed in the story for a bit and then I've been spending time up on this mountain hunting.
GlennCuttlefish remember you have organized crime to organize.
Look these bears aint gonna shoot themselves.
And your honor to uphold.
And a girl to coach into an idol.
By running down streets.
Oh and here I thought glenn did uber...
Well I have hunted enough to make a million yen it seems.
Now to waste it on booze!
Havent actually had to do that in this you get plenty of XP from doing those sidemissions.
This stuff is pretty good through and through.
Somehow my least favorite MC from 4 has turned into my favorite so far in this one.
This guy is a goddamn tank. also can clear out random encounters in seconds just as long as there are any big ass poles on the ground.
Naturally the place is always full of those ?
Most street corners have those posts.
Yeah Mini Metro's p good.
This keeps going through my head while playing yakuza just replace the name with haruka.
I am 5 minutes into the haruka chapter and already I wish there is a special woodchipper in hell for these people.
This time its rhytm games.
Just pretend it's Drakengard.
Look I never actually finished drakengard.
For a good reason.
I have reached the confusing running girl minigame.
I'll leave the rift open.
Ftrbzzs how is blade soul? as grindy and porny as I assume?
Anathema not too grindy totally porny.
Getting up to speed so I can see what the dungeons are like with a couple of friends.
There was not a single option for female characters where you wouldn't see sideboobs or thongs.
Anathema the dynamic battle system is ok want to see how it develops.
Anathema Draken Melk.
Ftrbzzs it looks very pretty.
Anathema it is all flashy and shiny and pretty.
And has about 1000 gold spammers in the general chat.
Is it fun though?
Yeah I like the dynamic battles.
Want to try out dungeons to see if it gets more interesting.
MoonWolf ah found it! a Hel Verdoemenis variant.
Ftrbzzs ^ beer I mentioned this morning.
I've had something from them before as well can't remember what.
Li-Ming is actually dressed.
This shouldn't be revolutionary of course.
Ok she isn't in either of her alt skins so never mind I guess?
I dunno man you're the sailor moon fan.
I mean yes Star Princess is fantastic.
But what about her butt? p.
Lunar Jaina is p cool also.
I mean it's a 100% top-down game Cooked_Auto.
All about the Darth Leoric to me.
MoonWolf finally got an Aquila Cuirass so I'm even harder to kill =D.
My toughness nearly doubles.
MoonWolf ah found it! a Hel Verdoemenis variant <- that'd be hel and damnation.
I did the conquest.
Even though the goddamn rift.
Gave me 3 floors.
Why the nervous chuckle.
That were ALL act 3 keep depths.
AKA my worst floor.
Ps Still stuck on idol rhytm games.
What happened to bear hunting and taxi.
And the running show remains incomprehensible.
I finished hunting and taxi.
Now I need to bounty spam looking for a gilded goblin.
No I need to instead Grift spam up my goldfind gem. whoops.
Sure in a moment.
Anyone remember the name of those harp demons from exalted?
Someone name a Silent Protagonist from vidya.
Other than Link and Freeman.
I cba'd the quote board.
So I have just put ... and am rotating the attribution.
Literally nobody else in the building gets it.
But it's keeping me amused.
On a p dull day.
Let the record show Minister is a giant nerd.
P sure it's already recorded.
Does Bioshock guy have a name?
Pretty sure his first name is mentioned in the opening but the name escapes me right now.
I wanna say Jack.
But then he's Jack Ryan and I think that's something else?
His name is Jack in this case and its also the name of a Tom Clancy character.
There's an argument that his identity at the beginning of BS is fabricated of course.
Wow the entire final act of What_Chogs is awful.
Even the last characters sudden but inevitable betrayal was bad.
Still watching the final video.
But the entire final mission is fucking awful.
To the point where your eyes are apparently hacked to.
Power is out in the entierty of cyberpunk chicago traffic and pedestrians walk around as per normal v.
Oh gods the final monologue is insufferable.
Ahahaha Episode 34 D.
Oh Chip is finally doing ZoE2? O.
So hungry should have had a larger lunch.
TWO bottles of nutrient sand? =D.
A jug of nutrient slurry instead.
I can do the rhytm game parts right but I just cant seem to be able to do these interviews properly.
Minister I had leftover haggis neeps tatties for lunch.
Wait did I miss Burns?
Its tonight I had dinner early.
Wtf is a neep.
Yes Scots sometimes willingly eat vegetable.
Oh Chip is finally doing ZoE2? O <- doing zoe 1 again. first.
Didnt know that the first ZoE1 LP hadn't been online for years until he mentioned it.
MairBear level up set was a success.
33 minutes to level a witch doctor.
I knew this game was weird but I didn't know there is apparently a card game slavery ring that ends in marriage.
Noelor wtf game are yo uon about ?
Cooked_Auto guess i'm buying hat instead of playing the current pc version.
Evne though i own that already.
Literally a Jojo chapter name.
Jesus christ this comedy minigame is bullshit.
So you have to play the part of tsukkomi in this comedy group.
And you have to get the perfect reply both in humor and timing.
Problem is you have like 5 seconds to read the lines all while listening to the tone of the other comedian.
Who of course is speaking in japanese.
So I have no idea of what he is actually saying outside of subtitles.
<- dutch guy had HUNDREDS of bikes in his house.
Yeah that happens in Cambridge from time to time.
Maybe not literally hundreds though.
What with how small houses are here.
MoonWolf I now have both parts of LoN ancient.
Which is fun =D.
Time to build LoN something or other ?
Dunno what else is going into that set yet but.
My only other ancients so far are set pieces and shields.
Some sort of buddies build ?
Yeah my current LoN build would be single ancients from three different sets a shield and ???
Think it's something to wait on =P.
Oh wait I have an ancient Haunt of Vaxo!
I dunno what a stun build looks like for Crusader.
Noelor did you see my speed leveling result ?
So can I get Haedrig to make legendaries then reforge them in the cube?
If I have way more forgotten souls than death's breath.
Nah it specifically yells at me for using a crafted items =<.
Guess i never tried that.
Is Bovine Bardiche worth saving until we're all around?
But if you're just curious go ahead i'd say.
MoonWolf the fact the police's reaction to all these bikes is just.
Well not like we need any more might as well dump 'em.
Can't even auto transcribe let alone auto translate.
They're both p experimental.
But the translation definitely relies on the transcription.
MoonWolf highlight was it somehow going from >300 bikes to >300m deep of bikes.
MoonWolf highlight was it somehow going from >300 bikes to >300m deep of bikes <- it was basically translating dutch on hard mode.
Since a lot of those people were using rather thick city accents.
How the fuck did it translated the word Yard isolated into island.
These are adorable.
O more Bravest Warriors later this year.
The SNEK PORN is getting too good NSFW.
New fitness goal be Azula.
Step 1 learn to firebend ?
Step 2 become an asian 17 year old ?
MoonWolf dont you worry soon you'll have a mod that lets your snekfu be part of XCOM.
I'd love to have a viper on my team.
They are great ways to pull people into the middle of nowhere to die.
MoonWolf what the fuck are these fucking golden suit guys.
With the shadow stuff around their head s?
And they can clone themselves.
But they've not been announced yet.
It divides their hp.
They need to leave.
The massive AoE that disables all weapons.
Wow I didn't even notice the shadow shit.
Yeah i don't kno.
Blinded by their golden splendour.
I like how it just shows up in this dev mission.
And they go nah this is normal.
I think they are holographic or something like the outsiders were.
Also the intro for this episode is amazing.
Yeah there's a happy middle ground to be found between American broadcast tv with a ton of eps to a season and 11 seasons and the British model of like 2 seasons of 6 episodes each basically a televised cocktease. Haha.
MoonWolf I think they need to not be.
ChaosSmurf shoot them first then.
Apparently they're critical to the plot in some way.
According to our guy.
Ghosts of XCOM's past.
You might not be a million miles off.
He said something about living data.
I am so ready for this game to go totally batshit 75% in.
Cant wait to hear two of my friends go apeshit on skype then. This is going to be great.
I expect one of them to off all the characters she based on our Shadowrun team in rapid succession v.
From my OneNote a page simply titled Ohto pens.
Does oht opens make more sense?
Also one just titled '10 Masked Men'.
Anathema a useful number of them.
Depends on what you need.
Ten masked men can be great for a number of things.
Only up to ten though probably.
Nah you start with ten.
If you need more than 10 things done you want more than 10 masked men.
I mean why have five masked henchmen when you can have 10?
Or you'll not get all your things done.
You need something to throw at the powerrangers when they show up to ruin your day.
Cooked_Auto totally looks like a cyberdisk.
I'm an expert i can tell.
But are they not just masked men?
No they are made of clay and have no masks.
Clearly your perspective is skewed on just american power rangers.
Did putties not have masks?
Its Power Rangers of course there are masks.
I'm pretty sure they just had hard clay faces.
Moved on to next character in yakuza.
Finally done with rhytm games.
Maxed out all your idol'ing ?
And then RHYTM GAMES.
Not quite maxed out in the end skipped some missons on haruka since they started repeating themselves a bit too much.
Also the comedy show. Fuck that not doing it.
Don't know what gender don't care hot anyway.
John Smedley has pulled the plug on his company's new Kickstarter game after just one week. snrk.
Didn't see that coming.
Don't worry the game will still be released though.
Then why did he pull it!
Hero's Song managed to raise $136849 of its $800k goal over the past seven days. That's no small amount but apparently not enough to convince the studio it would hit its target.
I think we have finally reached some kind of 80's event horizon. Its just too much for me.
You mean Dark Millenium Online.
Also this one.
Well technically not since Dark Millenium died with THQ.
Woot my first level 80 in a path of exile league.
The waifu age has begun.
This one is pretty rad too.
The internet is such dicks.
That Panzer has started polsying the *soundtrack songs* she links for Life is Strange.
Oh that's just the algorithms YT run.
Nah spoilers in the comments.
Oh. Why are people not running with a comment blocker?
I mean why would you even want to bloody read the YT comments anyway?
Wow it really is the proper ending.
Pokemon Black and White take place in Watch_Dogs' Chicago. Now that just sounds horrible.
Wow it really is the proper ending <- wish that was the ending.
Jordi was the best character.
Good thing he barely showed up then.
I think I might finally have reached the end of this part in yakuza.
I officially won the princess league so suck it t-set.
Great. firefox tried to automatically update itself again even when I have told it not to do that multiple times then the updater died and now my firefox wont start.
Do other browsers have noscript and adblock yet?
Up for preorder.
Well chrome has adblock at least.
Well thats half of what I need but I refuse to give up noscript.
No idea with noscript might be available for chrome as well.
Grumble my favourite FF skin hasn't been updated yet. Have to make do with a replacement.
Well this years evo officially has too many pokeymans imo.
2 smash games and pokken.
Yes what a shock.
This article is everything i've said 5 years ago.
You are great at journalism.
The only difference is that they made it.
Instead of me speculating.
Did you say just a C++ MC will outperform Java ?
No i said a c++ MC would outperform the java wank they have now but would break the mods that basically define the game.
And horribly split the community.
There is more than that!
I stopped reading after the first paragraph.
Because well why wouldn't i if all they can be bothered to write in the first paragraph is the bleedingly obvious.
Looks like starbound but you know actually going to come o ut and have features.
Instead of in development nothing is happening limbo forever.
I feel I am dreading tomorrrow for all the wrong reasons.
Got a dentists appointment to get that wisdom tooth pulled.
And all I am dreading is that I have to wake up early.
Hey you get painkillres for the pulling.
Yeah but historically I have not been a friend with needles.
Like that one time I had root canal without drugs.
Cured me of my fear of needles let me tell you.
That was not a good time.
Glenn A US friend of mine has it worse he has Mt Dew teeth.
I dont even know what that means.
And please dont explain.
Weeeeeell Mt Dew has like three times the amount of sugar than other soft drinks. You do the math after that =p.
Its apparently a serious problem if you then skip out on proper tooth care.
Iâ€™ve managed to source alcohol-free whisky from the internet because weâ€™re actually doing Dry January.
Alcohol-free whisky? The world is horrible.
Its a parody site.
Anathema skips the part about Scottish people living in England being way more ott-ly Scottish than a Scots in Scotland b they do the rest of the year.
I enjoy this series.
Noelor its a solid series.
Holy shit that onion is massive.
Man is bad at fruit.
You think the early fruit is bad.
A watermelon shows up later.
John what are you doing with your life also quarter also watermelon.
A friend on Skype Neil Degrasse Tyson and B.o.B. the rapper are in a Rap Feud over flat earth theory And my only reaction is Sure.
Noelor gotta counteract the cultural oppression somehow.
Oh is that where it came from.
The rest of the stories about that party is kind amazing.
In just how dumb they are.
Well havent started dinner game in 30 minutes today my diet will be liquid bread. and maybe some crackers with cheese.
Get some proper food.
I'm not even that hungry. I just had some eggs.
Slightly over a week MoonWolf!
WHY IS THIS A THING.
Teen relationship drama ... my first relationship ended when she cheated on me with a mutual friend of ours and I didn't find out until weeks later when a different friend's older sister told me about it. When I told my mom about it apparently she already knew and though we had broken up already??? TEENS!
What thing why who i'm confused.
Dunnok people are terrible.
Also I debate that being easier.
The time it takes to grind that many bounties.
But you are going to have to grind some bounties at some point.
Is longer than levelling the gem and blowing up corvus.
I admire it as an alternate method more power to those who can do it but I'd die of dullness halfway through.
For some reason the cheapest bear at my usual shop was now some danish beer.
Ehh its decent. Certainly better than what I feared would be the cheapest this season. That stuff just tastes like horrible finnish flour sausages somehow.
GlennCuttlefish <- Can we conspire to make this the Orc Lord now?
Also I am a bit disappointed thats not painted red.
No that's the car.
Taxonomy from the perspective of trees The kingdoms of Plant and Not plant aka animal.
Plant is very complexly divided.
Not plant's first division is between Pisses on us and Does not piss on us.
Is that the binary of invertebrates is it?
Trees don't really care about skeletons.
MoonWolf Fae has responded to her RSI by starting a SSLP of a VN.
Noelor this is a terrible choice.
MairBear You contrary butt / Sitting on what others don't / Fuck these robot dice.
Who wants a go at pronouncing Thaïs?
It is a girl's name.
That is as much context as anyone in the world has for it.
As in the neckwear.
Or I guess a plural of the adjective pertaining to Thailand.
So a long I then k.
Be sure to remember that when I inevitably meet a girl with an i-umlaut in her name.
GlennCuttlefish.
This is one of the best brawls yet.
Yes mage fear my board of 6 boombots and dr boom.
For it is terrible.
Noelor Exalted is still in the past.
So that Azula thing I linked the other day is hard as fuck.
Noelor Daunting a Jamaican sunrise.
I like how my warmup bench press sets 40kg feel heavy until I do some progress sets 65kg and then going back to the 40kg feels effortless until I get to the 8th rep...
Anathema dude you could lift me in a bench press.
It sounds like a lot but a 65kg bench for someone my height who isn't impressive p.
Anathema pfft it's plenty.
Nope I need to hit at least 100kg this year.
Yeah well there's lots of 2016 left!
I should have been able to hit 100kg last year if I didn't fuck my elbow up and get lazy.
Better not to rush!
I'm spending my day making pretty presentation slides.
All developers in the cambridge office it may be streamed too I guess? are getting BWF training on Monday and have been ordered to do the tutorial.
I gotta be there to help with questions.
So you getting a new dev manager now?
Not that I know off.
Well I heard that you had some internal candidates for it.
I can think of some people who may apply / be qualified.
Chrome fixed a bug in their implementation of flexbox and broke my grid p.
Damn people fixing bugs.
IE11 still has the bug.
Last time I checked they weren't gonna fix it!
Well I was wrong didn't get te wisdom tooth pulled today. I did get the other critical tooth fixed however.
And now my nose is numb.
That seems like the wrong place to be numb.
But i'm happy your teeth are somewhat better than before you went!
MoonWolf they released a point release yesterday and changed the behaviour back it seems |.
Did they break something else when they fixed it ?
That exalted date should probably not be in the past.
Made 13a also not the past.
When is Sneks-COM out anyway?
Less than ten days now.
Man I'm all jet lagged and I havent even gone anywhere.
This is the worst.
Waking up in the morning is the worst.
Ok so that 3rd is probably accurate.
But 10th might not be.
Are you implying that a certain someone will forgo his DM duties to instead purge the xenos? p.
CA I'm simply observing that big game releases can knock back RP.
I knocked back Ex3 two weeks for uni stuff.
Minister it'll be fine.
Wait what xeno purging?
Better not be xcom.
But will it be? WIll it really?
GlennCuddlefish VIGILO CONFIDO MOTHERFUCKER.
I dont even know what that means.
MoonWolf from the commit message it degraded performance quite a lot.
So can you guess what comes after idol games in yakuza?
But jokes on you game after christopher robin you aint shit.
I can breeze through this with my eyes closed.
Huh The Witness is out.
MoonWolf it might have excellent sound cues.
Those would have to be some amazing sound cues.
Well the problem comes down to not everyone having decent audio equipment. like it would be difficult to do with just stereo or 2.1 speakers.
Speaking of xenos looks like games workshop games are on midweek madness sle.
Maybe they finally realized they need to earn money.
Oh i should mention.
PatternSpider has a new feature.
Store some loctions won't you.
What is cuck in the context of SA then.
Short for cuckold a word people have been throwing around waaay to often anytime utterly out of context.
Its the new 'beta male' term.
He's no strategy king.
MoonWolf DD related twitch sounds.
Some of them are fun.
These developers get it.
I... what? It's not that cold and the winds not that light get it together internet weather checker.
Oh wait it is that cold I read -10 somehow.
Work email that just went out Does anyone have an Oscilloscope I could borrow?
Someone is doing some hardware shit.
Japan in weird financial shit.
Makes its central bank interest NEGATIVE.
Not sure I like this last character in yakuza.
His story is fine but goddamn his combat is slow.
Sure he is good with weapons but weapons cost a whole lot of money.
I think I've come across one enemy with some kind of weapon on this character.
Well 2 now sadly it was a gun and not a melee weapon.
I mean guns are great just not this guys specialty.
Now I am not saying this game is driving me into alcoholism.
But this restaurant offers mug of wine on its menu.
Glenn plays yakuza as a little girl.jpg.
Stop being an alcoholic little girl glenn.
Chip's been busy I see.
No Deputy CHief Judge Fish!
I have never been happier than in yakuza to see people lose their shirts.
When ever that happens its go time.
I hope her moveset is good.
Because life is endless disapointment.
The FFX LP has some problems.
Its not a problem.
Well its a problem of not getting a clea result.
Omg it's a kitten.
Thats in the game Noelor.
There is a kitten offhand for WD.
Swaps PS4 to rest mode so that it can download without lagging everything... forget to unpause download. Sure is me.
Now I wanna play WD.
The off hand isn't great though.
WD peridot is perfect.
It's a cat MoonWolf.
It's a wolf MoonCat.
BwaS is it though.
Btw exalted will be starting late.
On account of my only having got home ten minutes ago.
MairBear half an hour?
I need to start watching bollywood movies.
Carbon continues being the best element.
Did you say carbon cabron? P.
Anathema 5xp and 4sxp.
MairBear MoonWolf also ^.
Well this fight is just so many kinds of bullshit.
So if you want to increase your level cap you have to fight this old dude Who is the primary main characters teacher.
Who is the only opponent I just could not beat in arena in the previous gamesa.
But wait thats not all this time he is joined by his grandson who loves activating some kind of raging god mode counters half of your things and can slide across the room to throw you.
I'm sure I can do it fairly easibly by spending half of my health items on 2 characters on one character its probably going to be difficult and on the final character I suspect I will just fill only half of my inventory with health items.
The remaining half will be reserved for shotguns and lightsabers.
I dont even know how its supposed to go on haruka.
Well that fight was a lot easier as the tank. Since he is immune to staggering most of the time the counters did nothing.
Anathema what do you think of Burning Heart as a daiklave name?
How druids spend their downtime.
True origins of XCOM2.
It is not remotely an article about the city.
Which I neglected when linking because it's nearly midnight.
<- I'd watch it. Alone. And then keep it it my dirty shameful secret for the rest of my life.
That doesn't play on the OST and it is a shame.
Anathema I put the daiklave's story and evocations in your Roll20 journal =.
I have no idea how balanced it is it's probably op when teaming up with Tuscatsi.
But its too casual as it is.
Something fishy is going on. My leveling whisky costs only 10000 in this.
And gives only 330 xp?!
Well that explains why Audiosurf 2 never seemingly got any further support after release =p.
I have little experience with elaborate fight scenes and at some point I said to myself self you're going to draw an elaborate fight scene between a six armed spider vampire and a magical griffin. Dan Shive is smart people.
Dan Shive is smart people <- sometimes i feel that isn't true.
Oh gods America.
You did it america.
Noelor Burning Heart is a boss name.
Or as in should be a boss?
As in I like it.
This man has spent a long time looking at bank note maths.
When the world becomes unhinged he's there to bring balance... To breakfast.
MoonWolf PAX Firaxis panel is on.
But thanks for the heads up.
Is that soldier in the Tron pajamas the new psy whatever?
No clue what that armor is.
Fuck yes officers it looked like.
He makes a joke.
But actually the bethseda editors.
Almost alays throw out a few errors on startup.
The pigeons are actually a particle effect.
Intro was pretty cool.
I think thats just the intro for the first mission.
Doesn't really cover the whole start of the game.
Failing grifts because I don't have enough damage =<.
Engaged the boss with less than a minute on the clock.
Noelor i'm listening to an audiobook of Ancillary Justice. I don't know how you feel about space opera as a genre.
But you might enjoy reading it for its protagonist.
Also its use of language/gender/gendering.
A ship AI stuck in a single human body plans to kill the leader of the space empire.
And now Devil's Third has introduced a new type of enemy. Not-Las Plagas.
Apparently this game is a secret Resident Evil game.
MoonWolf why is XCOM 2 not out yet |.
Because life is suffering.
Embargo lifts tomorrow though.
MoonWolf did I mention we got in trouble for mentioning that on the site.
Also it's 1pm GMT I believe.
Why would you get in trouble for hat.
They were like PLEASE REMOVE THIS.
I have no idea.
Nothing in the embargo e-mail about an embargo on the embargo.
2K UK are one of the worst publishers I've ever seen.
The intro vid from PAX last night still isn't online.
A friend of mine isn't getting his review code until tomorrow.
We are embargoing your embargo with an embargo.
A friend of mine isn't getting his review code until tomorrow <- ugh.
I'm not sure who he's doing it for.
But it's somewhere major.
Telegraph or guardian I think.
ChaosSmurf someone has started porting Infernals into Ex3.
In which Infernal Monster is a charmset on the level of a Yozi's instead of a MA.
Hmm maybe the weekday ones arent all that prime for game reviews.
Get the code play over wk publish in sat/sun supplements.
!note MairBear Grats on doin git.
Noelor well they've got the right idea.
Making characters in Fantasy Craft is fun v.
It just keeps going.
A fillable PDF sheet and the GM guiding does help I can add.
Wait no the other thing.
I shall watch it once I am done procrastinating and actually have my dinner.
See rss updates 392... see we comic category 350 turns out oglaf pushed the entire backlog as udpates.
MoonWolf do you use feedly?
I think my bed was too cold last night I had a dream I was in Finland in winter.
Anathema I was freezing in Brussels was so happy to be back at home with cosy +21C inside.
Ftrbzzs have a good sunday?
Anathema was alright though I still had a bit of a cold.
And arrived home late last night.
But otherwise it was good.
Got lots of stickers -.
MairBear snek dancing not quite safe for work.
What _else_ do you want from an open source conference.
Ftrbzzs buttons ? cheap pens ?
Nah I stick 'em stickers on my laptop!
I don't see the appeal I haven't even used the Lavabit sticker I got for backing the kickstarter years ago.
MairBear so beagle just put an xcom 2 stream coming up soon warning on youtube.
Aobut an hour ago.
4 hours from now he starts streaming.
It is a beaglerush soon x3.
Hellsing Ultimate Abridged 6.
Not sure if that's your reaction or a miss-link.
Its topical to the video.
That was certainly also a thing.
Listening to a sequel of an audiobook different reader using differen voices and pronouncing things differently.
Bugs the shit out ome.
I need to listen to more of the books I have >.>.
Moon me old Wolf.
How would you like to powerlevel a secondary nub of mine when I get the gem of ease up a bit?
Just let me know when.
ChaosSmurf btw look at irccloud it has some of that slack-like stuff you where whining about last year.
Anathema its all about the Discord now.
Oh maybe that was it.
Whichever silly proprietary chat system then.
Today I spent far too much money for me on pants and shoes.
You got told mate.
MoonWolf add to PatternSpider so I can ask it if I need a jacket tomorrow.
Just turn on siri on your pc ?
I'm not always at a PC with cortana!
For example right now!
I thought I had an invite but I can't find anything on the website.
P sure that's just not the c- yeah.
I was too busy laughing at anathema geeeeetting duuuunked ooooon.
Welp I just did LP co-commentary again. Been at least 4 or 5 years since that happened last.
Which is funny because my first co-commentary was for Ace Combat 6 way back then.
Ofcourse there is an ace combat 0.
Well yeah? It's the prequel game chronologically speaking.
English and celts.png.
Qwertee continue stealing designs.
This time from MoonWolf of all people.
Tbf I was thinking of OTS as well.
Tonight in exalted I did nothing but complain to and correct Janos about Infernals.
This is in the alchemicals game mind you.
We're in Hell because tED.
Noelor So have you ever used the term Batter the bulk out of it before? p.
But out of morbid curiosity.
Wtd is the context?
Well...'batter' is slang for beating or hitting something and bulk is obviously majority. So it just means to quickly finish most of something in a rough slapdash manner.
Well at least you grew up without hearing AHM GONNAE BATTER THA FUCK OOT AE THAT CUNT being yelled across the school playground Scotland v.
But yeah I'm just going to write this one off as being a scottish thing.
Sweet jesus poppy updated.
No. Nonononono. NO. Nope fuck no. Na-ah. Nooope.
I have finally found proof that no post can get me to make an imgur account and upvote.
Because if this doesn't do it no post will.
GlennCuttlefish what if every picture had a pun?
Ohey one for Glenn.
MoonWolf how good are you in theory at grouping up squishy monsters in diablo without hurting them?
How much damage is not hurting them ?
The squshies have about 35m.
Can't really help you i think.
Maybe in a week i'll have the gear for a support monk ?
Pls never make me repeat that next season blizz.
Or I will literally jsut not make DH.
The UE set dungeon is like rift farming you either get lucky in mob layout or you just fail.
Err progression* not farming.
Decided to follow The Rock on instagram.
What does the rock post pictures of ?
My goal build for Ascendency p.
A flickerstrike discharge build... because who want to know or udnerstand whats happening on the screen.
Anathema wouldn't you get headaches from playing thta for over an hour ?
Probably I'm not actually going to do that.
You need a very specific weapon for starters.
Oh god flickerstrike on a boss is terrible too.
I figured it'd finally stand still.
Flickerstrike is one of the spells that is fun to use but will make other players hate you.
Since discharge is another one of those spells p.
I love it when my coop partner is a teleporting lag inducing madmen.
Which isn't exactly... good. with latency.
Since they added lockstep latency is ~rarely~ an issue the massive FPS drops are the biggest issue.
Like opening strongboxes can cause clientside pause as the client loads the resources for the monsters that get spawned.
But the monsters can still attack you obs.
D3 loads all monster data with a level.
And streams in class stuff some sometimes you get lag when you use your abilities first time you loaded the game.
But strongboxes can bring in monsters from other tilesets.
One of my problems with underrail is that I keep getting lost.
Like I just took a train to an outpost and I never reached it from the trainstation.
Oh come on! Wandered around the underground maze for 30 minutes found another train took it to the place I was going to.
And got lost again.
Now if a sign says -> thataway to the place you want why am I still not there 3 screens later.
Til GlennCuttlefish is bad at trains.
OH BUT OF COURSE THERE WAS ANOTHER SIGN SOMEWHERE ALONG THE way.
That I couldn't see because this game is darker than a doom 3 with the kill all black children mod.
And do you know why I had to go there?
Because I talked to a guy. A guy who had vision of me finding some great treasure.
You should talk to more people.
Which I did. it was in some abandoned warehouse in the middle of nowhere in a hidden room that was some kind of maze made by an asshole who had a fetish for bear traps and freaking mines.
I swear thats the last time I take quests from anyone drinking mushroom brew.
Internet is really really odd today.
It's only my PC that'd dropping literally every other device is 100% fine.
Have you tried rebooting ?
Have you tried turning it off and on?
So letâ€™s recapitulate. Namco-Bandai cannot afford even the very minimal changes required to support arbitrary resolutions or superficially QA their product but they can afford a completely ineffective DRM system. An ineffective DRM system for a game which people if they were so inclined have been able to pirate freely for over a decade. snrk.
A Rampage movie? Really? v.
I look away from the internet for like 2 hours.
And suddenly hearthstone has format.
I'm sure ChaosSmurf enjoyed writing that article.
While I do love the yakuza series I am starting to be tired of seeing people shot in the back.
Ho honor at all.
What are these common criminals?
Meanwhile the fiddling continues.
Wait that came out wrong considering I am back playing the idol.
..wait I can do the dojo training as haruka.
Oh boy dance battle with komaki.
Against martial arts master.
I meant to paste a link to this stream and instead pasted a link to an alpaca I tune in to highly professional streams.
Oh gods one of the PCs playing a bird character who is now trying to setup a retail chain named CAWsco.
Noelor i think you made a typo.
The stream I am watching is of Black Closet custom games.
Which let you load up whatever 5 names and images you like as your minions.
It's about to be the default 5 but with googly eyes.
I have a >0 amount of blame for this.
Googly eyes are pretty great though.
Someone brought up.
So one of the guys on stream has just been scrolling through it for...
Easily half an hour?
Oh it was because one of the events in the game is a minion filling another minion's room with googly eyes.
GlennCuttlefish one of the cases in this game ended up with someone's science project creating drunk bees.
Noelor drunk bees are an actual thing!
They get drunk off of fermenting nectar and such.
They get wobbly and bad at landing.
And then other bees cut their limbs off!
I should write a poem about drunk bees.
Bee life is tough.
Clearly it is time for me to go to bed.
And this choice has nothing to do with your pun.
I should have gone to bed at the end of the first Black Closet run instead of staying up for googly eyes.
Why would you ever make drunk bees.
Well turned out the martial arts fight was easier than I expected on the weapons master character.
My weapon of choice Shotguns.
Look it was 2v1 to begin with.
I did it fair and square with 3 characters.
Let me tell you it was not fun with the juggler.
Because these people are immune to it.
Goddamnit dont do this to me game.
Well not only did the game do that to me it kept going after I told it no I am not enjoying this stop.
Well with yakuza 5 finished I have completed 3/4 of my backlog I meant to clear this year.
Up next vanquish maybe that zombie yakuza after that if I am feeling like it.
MoonWolf top crusader atm is running a legacy of nightmares.
Other discovery from last night's Black Closet stream one of the possible cases is worries that one of the girls is a goth.
She wears black clothes and everything!
The metaphor the Ex3 combat system uses becomes less metaphorical when you're using fists and rapidly ascends to greater layers of abstraction as your weapon of choice becomes pointier. Holden there the great communicator of our age.
What if my weapon of choice itself becomes more abstract Holden.
Are we now in exponential abstraction ?
What if i'm in the wyld and hit someone with the abstract concept of pointyness!
Also dammit it takes me way too long to remember the topic.
Talking about the topic.
Mairnai how is brother status vis-a-vis tonight ?
...Ok I'll not change it if you're about to.
Because you have a real keyboard.
What do you want to change ?
And something pithy about fighting a stag.
If we do not 13A tonight I should probably put stag stats into the roll20 sheet for easier reference.
What is more likely is that I'll play some more Kingdom.
But on mumble and with Steam switched back on.
I can hang on mumble while you Kingdom.
Well there's nothing planned so I'm free tonight.
It's a cool wee game.
So yeah will be there!
13A it is then!
Yeah as in monster crits and glenn-salvo.
This is both adorable and kind of creepy at the same time.
MoonWolf steam tells me this is my last chance to pre-purchase XCOM2 or I'll miss out!
*sees no bonus for preorder*.
You'll miss out on the... i think free soldier with old xcom armor ?
Ah fair I thought it was just an amusing steam popup. Preorder this thing! If you don't! You'll just have to buy it at no difference!
If you don't pre-order it.
You'll NEVER be able to pre-order it instead.
You'll have to REGULAR-ORDER IT.
Poetry is so dumb >.>.
The Imperial Radch series is great and anyone who likes language stuff gender stuff or standing in line in front of public offices as a form of protest should read it.
Also imperialism stuff and transhuma/ai stuff.
Most of this is my bag yes.
Its the name of a fictional empire in space.
I was reading some IT documentation earlier.
Which was so dry I genuinely started falling asleep.
However I did learn something.
Keep it in reserve.
MoonWolf the valentine event in FFXIV this year...
Group up with someone else. And have your love-fortune read by NPCs.
The company I work for an international construction/engineering firm does not have externally-verified public security keys for data encryption.
Your company is bad.
And should feel bad.
This came up because we wanted to send sensitive data to a bank.
Mairnai start a greater rift before i can do anything get charged by an elite pack of those reaper assassin guys die.
The solution was we'll just use the bank's encryption.
So I guess we still don't.
Kirisu that works but your should have countersigned keys for this.
Might be delayed tonight btw.
An important computer is fucked.
Grmbl the one time I actually need the receipt for my bus card I cant find it.
You ate it your sleep.
!note MairBear It is done.
At the bus stop now.
IT decided the computer couldn't be fixed today went home.
Didn't bother telling us.
GlennCuttlefish MairBear Noelor sorry to do this at this point in time.
But i'm cancelling game for tonight.
We have guests staying longer than i was told about.
Just got back from dinner.
I'm going to hang in mumble but i can't commit to hours of gm'ing.
Cooked_Auto that link from 35min ago is already 404.
Cant imagine why the thread was only about ERPing after all and that image was an ad for an escort service. In EVE.
Welll thats a thing.
Mair you having internet issues ?
Oh wait someone remade the thread because why not. With the same image. Contains ASCII tiddies/nipps.
EVE EVE never changes.
Perfect trap if anything.
Now half the g-ads I see are from Amazon.
Specifically telling me to buy that book.
Because I looked at it.
Didn't realize it'd be that agressive.
Have a funny pie chart.
Noelor you have two tweets refering two a thing.. but no tweet of the thing ?
Phone what are you even.
Mair continues to not have internet worth a damn.
One of my skype friends internet seemed to pop a fuze whenever we did Shadowrun with roll20 and skype call at the same time. Kept lagging out constantly.
Really skype and roll20 was too much at the same time ?
Apparently. Scottish internet vOv.
Iphones can't play webms.
For whatever that's worth.
Iphones are ... shit in ways i never expected.
Doesnt mac have issues with webm playback in general?
MairBear xcom2 is preloaded now.
Looks like its a midnight release.
And it's your LAST CHANCE to preorder and thus preload!
I mean I already did.
Brode has had a beardcut.
The Hearthstone zodiac yes Ben.
That was a thing before.
'll definitly be a thing they remember.
Anathema what's the server details again.
MoonWolf assume you've seen this.
Well not the slow part xd.
Maybe they are still distributing and you are not caught up yet.
But i get short bursts of download.
13 megs a second.
Mid-europe server almost certainly more strained than UK.
I think you can change download location.
I think we have an amsterdam server.
But steam has never been transparant about that.
Settings -> downloads has a server selector.
Just sez Netherlands tho.
Which could mean anything from a server right there.
Or that one in paris.
I think we have an amsterdam.
But i don't know.
Of the 10 HS people I e-mailed Kripp was the first to get back.
Not very usefully but there you go.
Every time I try to activate the second code in my e-mail from GMG it crashes the client.
Honestly not a big fan of Kripps game insight.
Okay it worked it out eventually.
I assume it's for the DLC? I don't kniow.
LolxdCS i finished the d3 season.
What does finished mean.
And yeah Kripp's not the best but having his name in an article is a good idea.
The season has a bunch of goals in the season journey.
I completed them all and got the fanciest portrait.
Then 10 were Frodan Savjz Purple Kibler Kripp Reynad Amaz Kolento Trump and StrifeCro.
Were any of them actually hard.
Not really that hard.
Our news guy just reposted a story we did days ago.
Come the fuck on.
Isn't it your job.
To keep that from happening.
It is in that I'm meant to tell them hey fucking check if we've done stories before before you post them.
And make sure things are tagged properly.
Tell him to post about xenonauts 2.
He is doing that right now in fact.
Oh wait I lied.
It's next on the list.
He's doing something about a COD modder.
ChaosSmurf|Mibbit didn't realize cod had mods.
Yeah I don't actually know what it's about.
You know I swear I copied my putty over.
Procrastination is the best motivator.
I was supposed to do the dishes. Cleared front yard of snow instead.
You sure procrastinated succesfully.
Well the dishes remain unwashed.
You win the mould trophy!
Oh come on theres no mould.
I am not that big of a slob.
He said trying to locate his amplifier among the ocean of empty beer bottles.
ChaosSmurf MoonWolf thinks Infernal Monster is just about punching.
ChaosSmurf what game did TELL ME YOUR SECRETS PILLAR! come from.
Was it me and Ana in your Infernals half-session?
Joys of living in finland failed to take out the trash since the bin is frozen shut.
Also my mailbox was frozen.
Ehh. Hopefully that goes up during the day I would like to be able to retrieve my mail.
What are cats.
These are some lazy cats.
A thing I really like about the WiiU.
Is that you can use its controller as a remote for the TV it's plugged into.
I did not know that.
But that is neat.
I got IRC back.
Oh yeah I never linked the complete FC character sheet did I?
Decrypting is taking forever.
I need an ssd.
Well points for accurate thread title.
Lemme just... acheive consciousness.
It's taking forever to install D.
Lots of mysterious .bin files.
A brave new world.
You sleep about 1.3 hours more than the typical person in this group.
You have more hours of restful sleep than the typical person in this group.
Your sleep is less restorative than the typical person in this group.
The restorative scale goes to 100 average is 38.5 in my age / gender group.
I have 18 |.
Get a warmer bedroom?
I'm plenty warm at night!
Anathema what if it starts freezing agan.
I'll put on socks and get a hot water bottle again.
Anathema I know a place where the inside temperature is nice and cosy all the time..
Anathema cosy +21C indoors.
MoonWolf think I'm not gonna bother with mumble till net is more stable B.
Did it help ?
I wish I knew on what basis my computer decides that sometimes USB transfers must be slow as fuck.
Moving 10 gigs to external should not take 30 minutes and hog up all of my resources somehow.
Theres a PC version of splendor.
Is that a sale window they've used before? feels like a new one to me.
Cant remember seeing it before.
Aaaa next sales going to be who knows when so I probably should buy some games now.
But I really need to save up a bit more to buy that GTX 950.
In todays religious news public prayers are no longer allowed in phoenix city council meetings.
This came about because they had to choose between a moment of silence or allowing the satanic temple to voice their prayers as well.
Need to rewatch ParksRec at some point.
MoonWolf didn't answer because I was eating a carrot.
Gah sorry right right.
? <- the first serious upload to xcom2 nexus.
I expect Snek mod.
What a dick.
Anathema 5xp 4 solar.
MoonWolf how I change operation names again? D.
I'm going to have to resist to keep posting the xcom emote on skype v.
Pokemon battles on motorcycles!
Post of the day from the local streetpass grp some brony is having a crisis of identity because he loses at smash bros.
Don't anchor your self worth on smash.
Of course that's a skill she has. Of course.
XCOM2 mission complete screen Wounded Gravely Wounded Gravely Wounded Active this last one is a sniper.
TIL how they did BB8s voice in Star Wars.
MoonWolf I swear XCOM EW did it for the arc thrower too...
But XCOM2 loves to dick around with my skulljacker.
Oh you got near an officer? Let me mindcontrol you while the officer runs through several overwatches at nearly no health.
Have you manged a skulljack yet ?
Good Luck You'll Need it.
Is it a low %?
Do I need to weaken them to 1hp again.
I am not going to spoint it.
Are you internet stable enough to mumble ?
The same thing that appeared in the room they took the great commandy one from.
Mairnai how did the thing treat you ?
What if they want tea but they really enjoye it if i force them to drink tea.
Is it okay to force them to drink tea then?
Have you set up a safeword and agreed to any limits?
MoonWolf Operation Shadow Slap.
And I haven't even edited yet.
4 gravely wounded the only one unscathed was a sniper who missed all but one shot B.
Noelor why are these future lesbians so fucking adorable.
Omg I have forgotten to read future lesbians.
For apparently 4 whole weeks.
I may have actually looked up a latin conjugation chart.
Nothing wrong with that.
Noelor change your game date ?
Dammit I knew there was a real reason I'd looked at the topic.
Before getting distracted by latin.
MoonWolf the loading times.
Sometimes skyranger is realtime.
I'm gong to make immersive xcom.
Neptune's Pride but sometimes you have to stay up late to do the missions.
MoonWolf you're now playing nursemaid to the wounded.
Unlock better weapons by making them yourself.
Xcom 2 are you okay?
My next mission is going to have 3 sharpshooters by the looks of things.
That is not a healthy roster.
When are we powering surveillance cameras with candles?
Is this that lightbulb kick$tarter?
I prefer salt water powered lamps instead.
1 dot left before avatar completes.... I take down facility.
I fly to base to get supplies dark event gives enemy another avatar point... great.
Noelor real life kinnaru.
But of course you would want to put a door there that doesn't show up in high light.
In one of the darker areas of the game.
Behind which is a mandatory area.
Look harder next time.
I just used the dumbest naming joke ever.
I realized one of my snipers had a fairly well upgraded gun with no name.
And had had that for a long while.
So i needed a name.
And eventually i was like maybe it doesn't have a name because its anonymous.
But anonymous doesn't fit.
So i typed in anon-san.
Because i'm a huge nerd.
And then i remember that korean has an equivalent honorific -nim.
So now its anon-nim.
...Fuck the endgame of underrail. This game has become some kind of fun repellant down here.
MoonWolf I indeed approve.
Well I got surrounded by 4 bullshit endgame mobs covered in tentacles stunned on round 1 my brain was destroyed by a psychich zombiemonster I died and THEN THE GAME CRASHED.
Not only did it crash it crashed with that annoying sound loop crash.
This seems like a really late review to do v.
It also feels more like a review than a review.
MoonWolf Codex prepares it's weapon-disable-explosion. I hit it it clones..... into the sphere.
Mairnai i lost campaign over due to avatar progress.
I am expecting to any mission now.
Both Major perks for Sniper are pretty great D.
I broke one facility Avatar progress reduced by 1.
I break a second facility. Progress goes down by 5. o.o.
Suddenly I feel I'm not about to lose xD.
What does the avatar thingymajig do?
Its the big evil project the aliens are doing.
If it fills up all the way you loose.
Since in the past my I have been bad at dealing with written notes and descriptions while GMing this week I'll try a new approach scribble down sketches in a couple of minutes and see how that works for notes.
Wonder if I should go outside today. Stores should still be open Not that I really need anything but its been something around 10 days since I last left the house.
The sun set 3-4 hours ago.
And if it isn't I'll probably sleep late and not see the sun anyway.
Mairbear is it just your connection or are you constantly restarting the game ?
Great. PS3 splitter is eating enough resources that mumble crashes every time I try to connect.
Amazon.ca never ever change. A customer review on headsets opening with a thesis on the film Casablanca.
Scrolling the steam sale seeing the 'in library' tag wondering when it was you bought a certain game adamant it's never been installed.
MoonWolf flashbangs work on codex it seems.
MoonWolf the number is accurate but does not include turrets.
Also that mission briefing lied it was not Very Difficult at all.
I forgot the special thing about andromedon.
It was not good to forget that.
MoonWolf you ended up Irish btw.
Thats okay by m.
You got gravely wounded on your second mission sorry friend =<.
My first mission in my new campaign with a mech in it.
No reloads or anything.
MoonWolf you have been promoted to Acolyte.
Of who or what ?
Could anyone do me a favour and type `e?
Nm XCOM doesn't do ctrl+v.
It does do alt-codes though!
This was probably too much effort to give my french soldier a french nickname but WHATEVER.
Entirely apropriate amount of effort imho.
And oglaf put the whole backlong in the rss feed.
I'm not seeing it.
Maybe your rss feed is better at filtering it.
The more I play vanquish the more I want to replay metal gear rising.
Man its weird that a Marvel F2P mobile game has Dave Franco voicing Iron Man Alison Brie voicing Black Widow and John Cena do doodoo doo as the Hulk among others.
Also has Ms Marvel being voiced by an indian for that part. Which is a nice touch.
Also the waifu is strong in this.
MoonWolf oh lord.
I buffed it >.>'.
The hack bar was 1 bar off taking control of it too Dx.
Hwo was the death ?
I ran the feck away and managed to buy a turn needed to stun it with other specialist.
And then it missed its shot.
MoonWolf so hellweave is fun xD.
Cooked_Auto> Also has Ms Marvel being voiced by an indian <- somewhere some pakistanis are angry about this.
Mairnai no clue what a hellweave is but it sounds great.
I'll not say anything beyond it being a non-experimental research.
Mairnai are you sure it isn't just Legion's new tailoring tier?
Pectoids ain't shit. Kill their escort they're weak asf. Rules of NatureCOM is the best way to play.
Noelor it may well turn out to be!
<< twitch plays... controlling a bucking bronco that is also a couch to get its rider to fall off while carrying microwavable lounge snacks.
I intend to one day write an erotic story about a magical shipping wand that makes everyone’s shipping fantasies come true. The target audience will be punctual package delivery fetishists.
Ouch there goes my first full annihilation of the squad.
I saved at the start of my first retaliation with I assume chrysalids.
In preparation my squad is the A+ team including incendiary rounds and grenades which Shen just invented for me.
So that was the prophet. A bit too artsy for my taste but well worth the watch.
I did end up watching it in one sitting.
Yesss the perfect dark ost is on youtube.
Oh man the xbone can play the 360 hd remake.
I may need to buy an xbone.
Have you even played Perfect Dark!?
But its only one game.
There are probably other games.
Anathema get one and we can play stuff online ayy!
I got to play the PS2 version of Oni as well last night its lower res than the PC version and way harder to control.
Go error model sidewipes.
Anathema i really like these contracts.
The countdown has started.
MoonWolf got distracted by actual work just before he got into describing them.
Gotta code review one of the biggest new features being added to our sort-excel data-grid.
Not copy/paste but now we have pretty colours for new / edited data!
But those buttons you are using feel busy as fuck.
MoonWolf you think that is busy?
That is probably as bad as it gets though.
Most types don't support all of copy view audit lock open mass assign!
Something is making loud hard drive noises.
Someones disk is about to fail p.
Not mine though I have an ssd.
Anathema cute buttons looks almost as busy as Aquarius -.
Ftrbzzs I still don't know what most of the legacy products look like.
Harry threatened to have someone give me and Jamie a tour of Trinity a couple weeks ago... D.
MoonWolf greatest crime in the world that Midori isn't being actively pushed by MS.
I realize full well it'd be a dead os on releaes.
Shoulda been their basis for a mobile OS.
Anathema and you don't want to know.
Seems to be working out for the moment.
Well that kind of ruins my plans of playing metal gear rising today.
My usually trustworthy tracker as failed 2.2% complete.
Wait noI was wrong.
Which means yes XCOM tonight.
So I get to experience chrysalids sooner than expected D= but also burning chrysalids =D but still chrysalids D=.
Xcom 2 feels good Because it lets you win against things that feel unfair.
I just watched a video of JadeStar trying to get a squirrel out of his kitchen.
The second comment was XCOM pathfinding.
Someone made a romhack.
Actually let me find a link.
It is Super Metroid with the entire map rotated 90deg clockwise.
Anathema did you change the default room in mumble?
Mental note rules of nature on sectopod while hilarious can hurt bad xD.
Dragons dogma mods.
Bodyminds are serious Glenn.
I have two options to finish this sectopod.
I did not know they exploded when they are killed.
She got a crit even.
I did not know that either xD.
It made my poor ranger gravely wounded but it is indeed worth it.
Who was that apocryphal? russian ww2 sniper lady?
Her or someone else?
Sharing just for the preview frame no spoilers.
Mairnai your XCOM-self has the Englishest accent btw.
All according to keikakku.
Mairnai what class is/was your Jane Kelly?
She's making it through so far.
Mu probably edited its name.
What the hell.
Thats one hell of a workout.
Agreed to attend a course about working environments for computer users.
So far have spent a morning being taught about general health safety.
Legal responsibilities of employers.
And which acts of law are relevant and legal *structures*.
I'm sure at some point they'll be done letting you know exactly that this is all your problems and responsibility.
And teach you a thing.
Just the one thing.
The guy keeps... I assume he's trying to make it interesting?
But it just ends up as him either repeating himself a bunch.
Or going on total tangents.
So when are you actually going to talk about the actual topic ?
I played some reno controll warrior today for dailies.
That was a bit of a weird warlock though.
Where were any of his spells to just say nope.
It was rank 20!
MairBear SECRET MAGE.
Amazon decied its done seeing unity make money.
And UE4 I guess.
One of the license clauses is you have to use either AWS or physical hardware you own for hosting your backend servers.
Becuase amazon is just such a nice company.
Floridians are basically RPG player characters.
Overwatch beta is live now apparently.
Holy suck Scott Brick has done 325 audiobooks.
Thats a lot of hours of talking.
ChaosSmurf so the overwatch loot/cosmetics system is basically the dota2 s ystem.
Dungeon Siege 1 a cautionary tale of how not to skimp out on generating good loot.
Brocolli is much more delicious when you cook it.
ChaosSmurf Kaplan had time to shave in the last month game must be shit now.
Nah Metzen ate the beard.
Brocolli is much more delicious when you cook it <- also you can derive more nutrients from it.
We don't just cook shit just 'cause.
MairBear Noelor.
Haha I like that punk!Tracer has the word Punk written on one of her arm things.
Just in case you didn't get it.
Especially because that's actually p punk.
<- a good mod.
Seirousky a good mod.
The thought springs to mind of tracer listening to avril levigne *shudder*.
It shows an exact health numbe.
And it tries to do some pip grouping thing.
But thats pretty awkward for nw.
Noelor>> urge to pause that top gif to determine individual acts represented.
Probably because he's trying to do it in unrealscript.
Yeah the grouping thing's odd but.
But the actual hp bar is scaleform.
A commonly used flash bad ui thing.
Initially i was like why not recolour every 5 segments.
Jolly good! Pip pip and so forth!
But then i quicly learned that you just have very limited access to do that.
Without ripping open some flash files.
<< PCG on Dark Millenium Online.
Cooked_Auto that is p excellent.
I particularly like the part where they discuss how some of the playerbase arrivals might be the unhelpful kind a trait they may not desire running contrary to the grimdark.
In the Closed Beta right now Loot Boxes can only be earned by leveling up your account though we do intend for players to be able to purchase them with real money once the game is live there ya go.
Cooked_Auto that is also really cool.
The system is basically hearthstone card packs.
Only the packs are cosmetics.
And you gain them for levels.
Instead of on average every 2 dailies.
Watch them add dailies for bonus xp though.
Swap out of torborn he's useless on this map I need him for my daily!
Dob 'e woz a skater boy she sed see ya latah luv!
It'd be like HotS' dailies.
If they add that story-level stuff to in-game GUIs.
Man no matter how many times I stumble across that particular comic I can't get over that fourth panel.
4th panel is 100% why it was linked.
Not kissing yoooouuuu.
Well that looks like a great deal to me! v.
Cooked_Auto rip wayne england.
Good way to start the day critical issue to fix before the weekly catch up call with the team that noticed it p.
Noelor btw I mentioned it ages ago but you might have forgotten I can't Exalted this friday.
MoonWolf yeah I saw.
Undertale fans are the worst.
The proper song is no longer the top search result on youtube for Stronger than you.
I updated my password this week.
Unknown to death -> nor known to life.
Keep typing death instead of life because it's real similar up to that point and that tricks my muscle memory -.
Kirisu did you see my message re Exalted.
Noelor btw I mentioned it ages ago but you might have forgotten I can't Exalted this friday.
Kirisu i hacked a sectopod.
Those are great fun to have.
Also the tier 3 psi-amp requires the gatekeeper autopsie and a second gatekeeper corpse.
Which plotline are those down?
Investigate the codex brain coordinates.
Think I need to update my commas.
Do you know why they never have two eggs for breakfast in France? Because one egg is un œuf.
MairBear you are terrible.
As in resistance contacts limit.
Because the Codex facility is in China or summat.
Is it weird that I find tiny ladies attractive?
That could probably use qualification but pheh.
I'm glad I have the approval of MoonWolf.
Its not worth much.
Typical. When I finally get the motivation to start drawing I am out of time.
Which reminds me game on for tonight moonwolf?
Unless someone cancels on me.
<- great imperial radch author has a tumblr.
Just hwat i needed in my life.
Consonant can be used as in harmony with / in accordance with.
Radch culture has a thing for Propriety.
If only they were so keen on sensible spelling.
And yes I know I speak English but shut up.
ChaosSmurf I was listening to last week's Videogamer on the bus last night.
Someone at work who was on the same bus was just telling me he was afraid the guy behind me was going to punch me.
On account of how loud I was laughing.
Unsure how to take that.
Kirisu you'll probably like this post.
MoonWolf they were discussing the VGCU.
MoonWolf if it wasn't discovered yet.
Ctrl is waypoint mode.
Mair did you know you can walk though water to stop being on fire ?
The proper song is no longer the top search result on youtube for Stronger than you <- that cover is super spoilers as well that sucks.
MoonWolf that the water thing is great.
> Why Nintendo fans are excited about a just-revealed Pok?mon • Eurogamer.net <- Steel/Fairy or something?
Aw man the types aren't in CoroCoro.
Defs steel though based on its description.
Noelor np I didnt listenjust generally mad.
Anathema tbh if you want SU music online.
The show's musicians put up the whole soundtrack as a playlist on soundcloud.
This includes the version of Stronger Than You without the show audio over it midway through.
And it's generally updated a little while after a new episode so it has the last Stevenbomb for eg.
Oh no I'm lying.
It's just the first ep of the Stevenbomb.
Mair is a little girl.webm.
MoonWolf I killed a pharah as widowmaker and she said I think we should see other people.
Got up at 6am so I could have food before going to the gym and did the dishes.
I had an espresso for breakfast and now I'm hungry.
What stuff do I need to clean my machine again?
Also an espresso is not sufficient breakfast.
No no its not.
Why would you ever think it is ?
It's better than nothing right?
I don't do breakfast..
You make bad life choices.
I sleep longer dress up and go in 15 minutes.
Eating breakfast would meen less sleep.
I like to sleep.
That's why I eat breakfast at work!
It's a good point.
Maybe I should start doing that too.
Hooray my refactor of how entities visible to a user based on the permissions that user has is woooorkiiiing and is faaaster less DB roundtrips!
And tomorrow I get to see.
Loading a view with 1.3 million rows breaks something in the web page and breaks it so bad I can't use the dev tools to collect a profile.
Oh I know what it is.
Okay that's just straight up horrifying yes its worksafe.
Cooked_Auto unsure if real or just internte being internet.
I know academically that offense isn't a competition etc.
However when Janos complains to me that his Pathfinder DM misgenders his character a lot.
I have difficulty coming up with an entirely sympathetic response =P.
I can understand that.
Anyway he's confirmed he'll be around for tomorrow's game.
So it's still on.
And I need to decide if I need another pokÃ©mon.
Ok I just realised what pokÃ©mon I need.
So you need another pokemon then.
I know which species I need.
Want to know what else is straight up horrifying?
Things I did not need to read.jpg.
MairBear you should watch that rageorc qa if you have some time to spare its actually sort of interesting.
Gravitational waves woo science!
And by wave particle duality graviton confirmed!
Man firefox rampant hate for gifs is getting kind of frustrating.
End-of-episode monologuing Scully may be my ideal woman.
Ouch think I hurt my back today.
Aww I was hopin that 'bradford' was referring to the city around the corner from leeds.
Taking the mickey out of bradford is a very honourable passtime.
Why are the tumblr bits of that page in french.
They are not for me?
I blame the fact that you know some french.
Clicked on food cooking board on 4chan after 30 hours of not eating.
Bought Besiege in teh Steam sale.
Built a siege engine with flamethrowers.
Turns out flamethrowers ignite wooden siege engines.
Luckily the water cannon emplacements extinguished its smoldering corpse.
Yeah I know I have a rule about not touching early access games with a 10ft barge pole.
Cambridge is legit cold for once.
Its nto even freezing anathema.
Its colder than that outside there is ice!
Also excuse me mr my house is above 10C p.
Its a good quality in a house!
Anathema nice and toasty in Cambridge it seems!
Did you turn on heating yet?
Anathema not much different in south Finland tbh +0 and snow.
Ftrbzzs nah I didn't bother was just awake early again to have food before going to the gym by the time the house would be warm I'd be loving.
Got some painting done though.
Ftrbzzs done any painting this year yet?
Anathema too busy trying out new turbo trainer!
Well other than basing I've finished my commander.
Check out that moustache and monocle.
Never gets old.
Hardly seems worth starting a new task with half an hour left before I'm done.
Glance at the news as I pop into the cafe for lunch.
Subtitle Do women earn less than men? Or is it just a slow news day?
Ok so I haven't read this yet but it seems like a p good premise.
!note Noelor might also like this mod.
Is it substantially different to the other one?
I don't think I've opened the game with the other one active.
So I should be able to switch.
But I may open it with neither first tonight just to be sure.
I'm testing if this will override the other one.
If so i'm using it for this playthrough.
Otherwise i'll use it for another.
Man the week after next is going to be fun. First a hospital appointment to photograph my eyes on wednesday and then today I got an appointment at the doctors for friday. Bloody good timing.
Now I just need to figure out how to get the blood tests done since I need to do that on an empty stomach.
You think thats bad? I have tooth extraction and then proper root canal in a couple of weeks 3 days apart.
Man I'm glad my teeth turned out fine after the bracers.
And it looks like I get dumped at the hospital on monday next week at around 7 and then have to survive on fumes until after the blood tests are done.
MoonWolf did we not get an advance th'other night?
Also that mod worked fine with the game that had the other hp mod installed.
So that was nice!
They both work together?
They both overwrite the same class.
But it looks like whatever way that conflict is resolved.
That's very much prettier.
I like it a lot.
While i like the segmented hp bars in theory.
They don't work with the numbers you work with past the early game.
Especially on the big threat enemies.
MoonWolf something you might like on our front page.
She is a cool old shark lady barbarian.
ChaosSmurf if you can still edit that article.
I can and will.
Just happen to follow sawyer on twitter because he's a cool guy.
Handoff was a fucking shambles.
They sent us a single paragraph no blurb nothing.
No idea why I was even doing it I think it's because the dude they sent it to is too fucking lazy.
I do not like being working at 630 on a Friday when my signoff is 430.
Article did seem a lot like you found a video on their channel and just had to write a thing about it as fast as possible.
We have this exclusive vid do a thing on it.
At least it was 2 minutes.
I've been given exclusive shit that was 50 seconds or less.
And I'm like um.
Not only does nobody want to watch this.
MoonWolf this seems all up your alley P.
I have been made aware of the gay ghosts game.
My work here is done.
But thats forbidden love.
The ghosts never had any forbidden love.
So now they need other girls to have some.
./another/ eeveelution qwertee? jeez.
That one was honestly the best of the three.
Yesterday it was nothing but Deadpool shirts.
Mrgrgrgr the snow is back again.
At least it'll melt ?
Not yet at least.
Stupid winter broke my arm last week and now it's back to finish me off.
Nah nothing I slipped last weekend and cracked my wrist when it was thawing outside and today it started snowing here again.
Right now its either raining snow or hailing.
Careful winter's after you too.
Im inside and have no plans going out today.
Good safer that way.
So I just ran a session for my 13th Age group tonight and you guys get story time tomorrow. Featuring corrupted elemental spirits ransacking the town two lieutenants for the Prince of Shadows showing up and giving the party their hardest fight yet without doing anything themselves and our Wizard reading some of the Chaos Mage's books. And finding out that while they're several hundred.
Pages they're Skyrim books. Short little synopsis with a lot of filler page. Despite the fact that he clearly -remembers- reading the several hundred pages of the books.
Lots of other highlights too but those were the big ones. Oh and the Chaos Mage melding with a shadow made from another shadow and thus becoming more real. Despite the fact that neither of them existed.
!note MairBear watching HS winter tournament thing frodan has a pink 3 piece suit jacket and pink frosted tiped hair.
Mu what happend to next week ?
Congratulations hero for opening this trove of artifacts now you can proceed to use barely anything from it because our itemization is so shitty. Gee thanks Dungeon Siege for giving me a yellow item level +magic skill bow when neither of my casters can use it anyway v.
God I hope they actually kicked their collective asses for DS2 and improved the itemization because my god is it awful here.
The dumbest part really about the loot is that I'm practically at the end of the game and it still gives me drops as if I was at the beginning of it v.
Anathema they're pretty good imo.
I am defs a fan.
Is... is Freddie Mercury actually Dio in this video?
A more relevant question would be is dio actually freddie.
I mean that's semantics really.
That lass is rockin that plugsuit.
Â£5 says that's a nerf gun like a nightfinder or something p.
Nerf guns are great cosplay props.
Especially if you are willing to customize them a little.
Or customize them a lot in some cases.
The Maverick is far too obvious these days.
It has a nice profile!
Maybe but its really really recognizeable.
Wasn't dissing it just making an observation.
There was that time the rifle props in Terra Nova were spraypainted longshots remember that one.
I got some moisturiser today.
And it was security tagged.
And I don't know why.
Cosmetics and such articles are frequently stolen.
Moreso than many other products.
Alcohol content for purpose of moonshining?
Baws if you had the equipment to moonshine you wouldn't steal moiturisers.
For when you need your tea now.
Then clearly you've never wanted a cup of tea that badly. And you're supposed to be british. For shame.
SunTiger I still don't understand how these hidden abilities work but my most rules-of-nature soldier just got given Lightning reflexes D.
Mair okay your soldier has a predetermined rank at wich they can get a hidden ability.
If you have an aws up when they hit that rnak.
It is rolled from a pool.
That includes some abilities you cannot normally get.
If you missed your ability because you didn't have an aws when you hit the rank you can respec.
Or install a mod that makes it retroactive.
Got some plastic cocaine today.
Finecast cocaine is a better hit though.
I have to pay Cambridge house prices I don't have that kind of disposable income p.
Well that was fun.
Bsod'd and got cpu overheat error.
It cool down a bit and my idle temp was 74c.
Thats not a good idle temp.
Time to clean some fans ?
So my local GW is doing a kill squad event on the 27th right.
And you earn points for it by buying stuff and I spent like 200 on models today so I have 400pts for an infantry-only army list.
A squad of 10 guardsmen is 30pts.
Sadly I don't have 130 guardsmen.
And you earn points for it by buying stuff and I spent like 200 on models today <- argh.
Literally pay to wi.
Its just a stupid little fun thing no biggie.
They did a zombie survival thing before that was similar.
Now i could just clean the fan except it was running fine.
Or i could do something stupid and plug my hd from amd into intel mobo and see what happens this time.
Hm might have to reinstall this time.
Liking audiosurf 2's feature of a live 'ghost' mode.
Pity about the rest of the game feeling unfinished.
As you play a track it gives you a mini scoreboard showing what other players had at that timestamp.
The two thirds of the music browser that is you should play hatsune mike is obnoxious.
Yeah and the unfinished UI in general is awful.
Kind of sad since the first game was pretty solid this just isn't.
Hm. Cleaned the fans and idle temp is still 45c and rising.
Lets see how this works now.
Reboxed black reach models it seems.
Yeah thats been known for a while.
Go to bed early roll in bed for 90 minutes or so.
Wake up its 2 hours too early roll in bed for 90 minutes.
Bodies are the worst.
When can we get our brains uploaded.
You know I wouldn't trust that uploading bit.
I just wish to gradually replace my brain with a more efficient graphine network or something.
So I think I just finished Dungeon Siege 1. I say I think because once the boss died I got thrown out into the main menu because the ending cutscene didn't want to play v.
Its just that anything that replaces my brain in one go gives me existential crisis.
Which is a reason I wont ever use a teleporter if one is invented.
Hilarious it didn't even give me time to check my loot.
Guess I should unlock the expansion since its in the Steam version but hidden.
I can't believe I ever played through that.
Or did I? I think I did?
You didn't miss much =p.
If there was one word to describe that game its forgettable.
Kind of yes. I mean its a Diablo clone that fails at being a Diablo clone because the loot is terrible.
Speaking of diablo clones.
Why are lightning builds always the best.
Then again according to steam I clocked in 28hours playing DS1. Which isn't bad.
Real question is Why? P.
I wanted to replay it really.
And it was cheap during the winter sale.
Like 2eu or something.
Most under fire Mimic Beacon.
My second support finally got his AWC power and it's volatile mix.
He doesn't have enough pockets to use.
Otoh Mair's finally started learning Inspire.
Only 9 more Scions to go o/.
Okay so they have learned a lesson with the DS1 expansion the itemization is a lot better.
SunTiger I don't see anything wrong with the start of the Pharah video.
It looks like shit bitrate qualityy ?
How long does it last for you?
Like it's 1080p60 for me the whole time.
From memory a few seconds ?
Might have been still processing when you clicked on it.
Or YouTube's auto thing lasted a while?
Clears up around second 10 ?
This is what i get.
Can you ctrl + F5.
Or whatever to clear your cache.
I can give it a shot.
I think it's YouTube rather than anything I've done.
SunTiger what the christ.
It's just the first 10s right?
Lmk if it happens again.
I just had to explain to someone why warping images to our dimensions is bad.
Instead of cutting them to be 169.
He'd taken a 43 image and just made it the right dimensions.
ChaosSmurf hire me i'll source and cut up images for you!
He put this in an article and didn't understand what was wrong with it!
JUST LOOK AT IT.
Just try to read the text.
I'm trying to find the other ones.
That he used as header images.
Also its jpg using text use png.
But our CMS is so bad I can't scroll through images.
Well it's a screengrab.
And we miostly keep stuff to jpg because sace.
If you want poeple to read text.
You need a png.
Will remember for future.
Explains why so many of my screengrabs of reddit threads and stuff always look a bit piss.
Okay I can't find the others.
But they were fucking awful.
That's a really strange selection of african countries to take.
There is another set.
What article did they use such geopolitic to back up on a pc games news page?
THIS WAS A HEADER IMAGE.
I feel like always Salvo > Hail of Bullets.
Am I being dumb?
BwaS one on Democracy 3 Africa.
Noelor I agreed on both my grenadiers.
Because it means you can do grenade -> grenade.
ChaosSmurf well its not The Worst.
Since its just faces.
Instead of body shots.
HERE'S THE OTHER ONE.
ChaosSmurf oh god that one.
Yeah when I got him to change it I told him to replace it with something that isn't CliffyB giving the finger.
Which while I love as a header iamge.
MW has better will but Mair has better Psi score.
So the new Doom's been datamined.
And it looks like its project name was Zion.
ChaosSmurf can i ask you a sfv question ?
ChaosSmurf maybe it's... named for the place in the Matrix movies?
By someone who doesn't know the background?
If you can convince yourself of that.
Keep on believing that.
Well I can now add a city on to the list of things my group has crashed.
Now time to see if I can get grim dawn to melt my CPU again.
That new guy with the long sleeves.
Are those sleeves cloth physics or part of his animation set.
Do they move the same way every move.
Or are they dynamic.
Or to put it another way.
Are they part of his move tells or are they just distractions.
My question broke ChaosSmurf.
I think that what you just said remains true if I inset a comma though.
I have no ideea.
You might be able to tell by looking at his introduction video on the official channel.
But I'm not sure.
If anyone cares I think I'm about to do the last mission of XCOM2.
But i haven't done it.
So i'm just going to.
Wait to talk about it ?
I died on turn 1 =D.
Put this off to tomorrow night.
Dealing with my pent up frustrations with the nova char in heroes by whacking around the nova char in sc2 wings sure is cathartic.
Decided to play Black Closet.
That being lesbian high school procedural detectives.
And I discovered that playing on easy will just result in losing the game.
Because there's a traitor and you get a bead on her by seeing who intentionally fails missions.
But on easy you just don't fail missions.
So you can't find the traitor =V.
That seems like a bit of an oversight.
To be clear you *can* fail missions it's just real hard to get yourself in that situation.
The traitor is also randomized ?
It is in fact possible for it to randomly assign no traitor.
Just to really fuck with you.
I'm investigating a goth.
You find a crucified doll stapled to the wall - it was in plain sight. This is suspicious!
Thanks for the heads-up game.
You wouldn't want to miss it.
And think this was just normal goth behaviour.
This poll is bullshit.
No Ivy Harley? What kind of rat bastard designed it?
Pretty sure thats still a relationship that exists only in subtext.
Its not like DC knows what to do with their characters anyway p.
Its not like DC knows what to do anyway p <- ftfy.
Its some big ass subtext on bold font.
There's a joke here about Harley putting the sub in subtext.
I'm not 100% clear on their relationship because I don't read Batman.
Also I'm going to bed.
Well thats partly horrifying and partly punny.
1705 SunTiger <--- why is Rooney in that game? is it a football game?
SunTiger because I knew you don't read the commentaries.
I feel like either of those first two panels are pretty wallpaperable.
I would honestly argue that one of the main theses of Life is Strange is that teenagers are fucking shitty.
Especially ones with time control powers ?
Especially ones with time control powers ?
I think the fact that time travel makes Max imo no more or less shitty than her peers is like.
The crux of that statement.
SunTiger did they patch D3 to make it suddenly much harder? Because my DH is struggling at GR 65 suddenly...
When I was up to 68 before.
MairBear nothing has changed.
No idea what's going on D.
I mean there were loads of the khazra spear throwers + the infamous bogan trappers but I'm dying to more to this elite pack that should be nothing special just thunderstorm lacuni stalkers.
Are you in TX gear/skill.
When you should be in high rifts stuff ?
...I'll tell you what I think it is >.>.
I did have some gear wrong so I righted it. My skills were still in order though.
But I think the cube is wrong.
Which if so means a survival rune on my vengeance is missing.
Which would explain the deaths.
That is in fact a psi-operative with ALL THE POWRES.
2 powers out at the end of my game I think.
Now go finish the game ya dummy =P.
I must have all the continents!
I also built a lab.
Just to gte the build in all the slots cheevo.
So you have no research left?
Only research i'm not doing because its plot.
I read Beat the game on Commander+ difficulty by July 1st and was like... 'what is that half a year after original release date or something?'.
That t-pose one is soo dumb.
They all look terrible but that one is possibly the worst.
Put a cross behind him and suddenly he's wolf jesus.
He died for your stims?
Wrong type of space marine best I could come up with.
Placed top 50% in today's Mini Metro daily.
I am really liking grim dawn I just wish it would stop giving me the BSOD.
Truly a passing of the torch - the monday night bob ross stream gets more viewers than the new run of TPP.
I just Googled ovipositors and found out about a fetish I really didn’t even consider existing oh dera.
Someone needs to get out more v.
Mind explaining for the ones who don't want to google a fetish?
I mean I think the ovi- is egg but...
Today's plastic crack activity. Now I need wheels.
Egg implantation pretty much.
We talking like chicken eggs up the unmentionables kind of thing?
Depends on the person i presume.
And their kink but usually more towards the latter.
Since ovipositors is usually associated with insects.
That's that tempestus scions APC with the ballsed up treads isn't it.
The Taurox I am giving it any treads thats for sure. I've got my eyes set on a wheel conversion kit for it.
An ovipositor is a thing that puts eggs into other things.
Extrapolate with the word fetish as you will.
Revolver ocelot joins Xcom.webm.
I am physically pained.
I think thats enough double action boogaloo for now.
You can't hear mumble ?
Won't let me buy it to get into overwatch though.
You snooze you loose.
Also the case for dark millenium online.
That game died a couple of years ago p.
Bahh cant get tablet pressure sensitivity to work for some reason.
Time to boot the computer for the third time today this time without a crash.
So that was gravity falls.
May have picked a HH legion.
Have fun paiting yellow p.
That is a really cool design.
Just encountered the word woke.
Which derives from the afro-american version of awake and means aware of social issues.
Cooked_Auto I'd rather paint yellow than boring all black like Iron Hands and Raven Guard.
There are plenty of non black Legions p.
Although if you then decide to paint white scars or something you only have yourself to blame.
World Eaters are cool but >mostly white.
Alpha Legion are an interesting colour.
FW doesnt even use Citadel paints for it v.
Sadly their HH painting guide they have for free only covers the traitor Legions in Book 1.
A manga about jazz anyone?
Okay the final mission of xcom 2 is LOOOOONG.
MoonWolf how's ie come out in Dutch?
Diphthong or compound vowel?
Like in Japanese or like in German.
But i'm not the best at uhm language stuff like that.
This is why I gave examples!
Also the game somehow turn into an origin story for xcom.
It took bloody forever.
But i did the final mission.
Woo evening saved. Got Lego.
Not too sure which one I want to build of these.
I mean for this one the plane is a given since its red and cool and kind of Crimson Sky-ish/Pulp air pirate.
Meh still not sure if I want to pay 20eu for PoE and play it only in story mode.
GlennCuddlefish mind if i hang out while you two talk about grim dawn ?
Just the first coat of red before washing and highlighting is taking me about half an hour per model at this rate I will not be finished my 9 scions for another two weeks.
Well thats how it goes if you want to make em look good. Just do an hour a day and it should be fine.
MoonWolf I wouldn't have minded just didn't notice your message until now.
Cooked_Auto will be doing more than an hour want to get my Knight assembled and painted but I'm not opening it until I have painted all my scions guardsmen thankfully they are way quicker and chimera.
Never liked the stuff.
Anathema Lesse I have a taurox a chimera about 20 marines a Razorback/Rhino more scions guardsmen a possible mordheim party an IG commander and a bunch of random assorted guys p.
Cooked_Auto get to painting then!
I know I know. I need to order wheels first for the rox.
WHich will be next week once I get my salary.
Anathema fixed gimbles javascript problem.
Anathema it was easy to miss but his buttons were in a form which makes all of them have the submit action by default. so it'd change the background colour with the onclick then submit the form refresh the page.
Controll warrior is still worse.
MoonWolf but Entombs' just a worse recycle.
It's like why would you want it shuffled into your deck!?
Every time i use it i just feel SO BAD.
That pads your cards out.
And keeps you from that draw you want.
Mair let me tell you about the final xcom 2 mission.
Longer if you need to reload.
And i'm not giong to say what to do.
But bring max level psi-ops.
At least the one.
I take control priests are annoying to play against?
They just take all your cards iirc.
They either just blow up your minions.
Or steal your minions in some form or another.
My steam wallet's over a pound.
Think of how many cards you can buy with that.
I have a 188eu on mine.
MoonWolf I take it you would not recommend I try to finish XCOM2 tonight?
Noelor you'd probably have to pick it up later ?
Thats a thing you can do.
Save in the middle of a mission >.>.
I always forget what I was doing.
If you do go i advice you to take Mair and myself and grab any gatekeeper mobs you find along the way in the mission.
You only actually get one chance at the daily challenge in Mini Metro.
They are really useful for taking the final room.
Otherwise people would just grind out the best results.
MoonWolf there's a cheevo for placing in the daily challenge every weekday for an entire week.
So I left it running while getting ready this morning just to generate a score.
And thought I'd try again this evening if I got back early enough to get a proper score.
Built a functioning mangonel in Besiege now.
It doesn't fall apart when it tries to fire.
Sometimes overshoots target fortifications.
The the not falling apart at least.
Score this evening 1639 including the cheevo for Paris.
Score on the daily this morning 529.
Does this metro game offer a map for the connection of sunderland to newcastle airport via monkseaton?
My brother also asked this.
There's only one map per country.
And we get London.
But that is at least level 1 and sort of the default from which the other maps vary.
Also every metro system in the game has at least 3 train/tram lines.
So our local wouldn't qualify =P.
Neither would Glasgow in fact!
I've been watching these videos ocassionally.
And some of them I'm like nope.
This one was sort of okay that seems reasonable.
Until about a minute in at which point how do your fingers even?!
Strategic breaking at a young age!
At some point it just need sa THIRD HAND.
Anathema did you ever get around to finishing Undertale?
MoonWolf I swear I just caught them demanding 6 fingers on the right hand during Megalovania.
Its certainly not a piano tutorial.
That implies youa re learning to play piano.
If you can play piano.
Well enough to pull that off.
You just need some sheet music.
I guess some people might learn to play using this sort of thing instead?
MoonWolf have you read Josh Mosqueira's CV?
Dude was Lead Designer on Homeworld 2 and wrote like 11 late-90s early-00s White Wolf books.
This seems... pointless.
Noelor nope I haven't played videgames in like 3 weeks.
Anathema do we need to fix this with some PoE?
I need to kill Rigvald and the league ends in like 2 weeks...
I should just start a new character.
Got into black desert online 2nd closed beta keen to try that out.
Maybe I am very busy.
- I wanna play with you anathema ?!
Sorry! I'm kinda burned out on GW2 probably forever and don't really play a lot of games anyway.
Ascendancy is out in like 17 days though!
Anathema it's ok we'll find something -.
Another good xcom mod.
Puts the fear into them.
ChaosSmurf someone referred to having something wallpapered as a card game term what deoes that mean?
ChaosSmurf what team is this about.
Because I read it as the team of writers I edit for.
But a friend read it as an e-sports joke.
Since its been a while since I last seriously practised my drawing skills figured I'd go back to basics.
And so for the last 20 minutes I've been drawing straight lines.
Maybe i'll go crazy and draw some ellipses now.
Don't get to experimental no.
MoonWolf just came across the pre-increment operator in a PR review. How do you feel about that?
As in `someMethod++Id //other params`.
In a method call.
I feel REALLY badly about that.
Vba lacking ++ still makes me sad.
What it does have I found out today is default methods for objects.
MoonWolf you asked me yesterday if having only double the second bests score was that bad for me in DBA.
This is how it should go.
Should have gotten more grenade kills.
Is everyone just terrible at this game ?
Bit of column A bit of column B.
The thing is I spent some 6 years of my life playing the specialists and the muscle memory from that translates almost perfectly into this.
So I do have an advantage there.
Game still on for tonight MoonWolf ?
Veteran designer leaving academia and returning to development to work on Underworld Ascendant and System Shock 3.
Man it's almost eire when Roll20 knows which campaign you're going to play.
FUCKING VIRTUAL DICE.
Anathema fix your mumble I.
Welp server conked out.
Noelor seems to be up? also there is literally nothing I can do about it its all managed by the provider.
We were all robots a lot last night.
Going through our current code that processes changesets because I'm writing an atomic one.
I can understand how it can be mega-slow for many entites.
And I haven't even gotten to the code that actually persists things.
Everyone loves 600 line methods right?
I'm a big fan.
Sorry I lied its only 400 lines.
Hmm I'll have to rewrite that method anyway it seems to expect a single entity validator which isn't going to be necessary anymore.
That means I can make it fasterrrr.
And maybe not use exceptions for program flow control >_>.
<- lolol we'r echanging the voting system.
Not too much though.
Wouldn't want to break the voting blocks.
Don't know if I mentioned but I got a decent pay rise this new year.
The first payment after which hit my bank this week.
All of the things!
Which things are those though ?
During peak we have about 500000 concurrent websocket connections open. Thatâ€™s a lot of browsers. Fun fact some of those browsers have been open for over 18 months. Weâ€™re not sure why. Someone should go check if those developers are still alive. o_0.
All servers have 2 power feeds via 2 power supplies from 2 UPS units backed by 2 generators and 2 utility feeds. <- theres redundant and then there is ... this.
MoonWolf they also have 9 IIS servers but can host everything on 1...
I believe thats a can in that technically connections get made and webpages get shown to peple.
If you enjoy 30 second pageloads.
That seems reasonable to me!
Shame that doesn't have a portable version would be nice to replace json.net with that.
Some of the tricks it uses are cool.
Though have to be honest.
Never felt that json.net was slow ?
Sure that thing is ridiculously fast.
But how many people need that speed on json files ?
Its not json.net is pretty fast.
For example it actually does magic to figure out whether the return value *from a property* is going to be constant value.
Why are the vampires on skooma.
Who's going to stop them the guards ?
Just wasn't sure they'd get much out of it.
TES vampires still eat and drink.
There are skooma pipes.
Smoked is one method at least.
But there is also a book named confessions of a skooma eater.
Eating and smoking the same substance makes sense.
Skooma is made from moon sugar.
Which is made from cane grasses.
X com gif it to ya?
1009 <-- BwaS.
I forget are Aus sticking around?
They would have definitely been in had they won but they're invited back again based on presumably performance and audience support.
With a production budget of $200 million plus $223 million for marketing printing and advertising costs and an additional $22.3 million spent on TV trailers this is how Hollywood now.
Noelor an exciting big change !
Unable to load saves with a Chryssalid Cocoon Oh THAT'S what fucked that mission's saves for me.
MoonWolf so I loaded XCOM and went to make tea.
Came back and a retaliation mission expired.
... i forgot time was a thing even if you weren't at the table.
It doesn't pass ifyou are in a menu i believe.
Hey noelor are you planning on continuing your exalted for long?
We're over halfway through.
What I have planned anyway.
GODDAMNIT why is my HL2.exe suddenly crashing.
Urgh what is the goto image editor on osx?
GlennCuddlefish Have a SOL manga about booze and food.
Glasses loves smoky whisky I think I have found mai waifu.
I just went with that later chapter because of the whisky.
MoonWolf so while carrying a body or something you can walk through a wall in wraith armour it amused me greatly the ideas.
And mumble is just dead.
Whats your idea ?
Omg I just heard a lady say Doobly-doo in a British RP accent.
RP? Right Proper ?
Just the dude being unable to walk through walls and thudding into it while the wraith wearere runs off.
Dunno what that means.
Your initial guess is a better definition.
I wonder if that is what happens.
MoonWolf this will certainly help!
But i will read it.
Step 1 LEARN IPA.
This article is terrible.
Step 1 learn ipa.
Step 2 here is a dozen words pronounce them this wa.
Step 3 lips ?
My accent is fairly received.
Because I had private education.
New thing about wikihow.
But not properly received because I lived in Scotland for a couple years.
Its this article is bad ption is ALSO BAD.
Where is the this article is bad and doesn't really adress the topic ooption.
Deathwatch mini's are back apparently.
Yeah saw them on SA.
Its apparently a monopose deal alongside a genestealer cult for a separate game ala Calth or that Assassins one.
Big change from the last 9 months.
Interestingly enough one of them is apparently a Blood Raven.
A shame its monopose.
Well now that's just depressing.
To be fair all the recent releases has had good models. Even the latest Wulfen one hint it's not the Wulfen ones I'm referring to.
Guess I'd stick to the shoulderpads conversion kit which still seems t be kicking about.
Remember a dedicated set once had it on a birthday list got black library Deathwatch novel instead.
That Anthology wasnt too bad from my memory.
Okay it wasn't that one.
Went about a kill team trying to save a world from a tyranid swarm that had been casually triggered by a heretical inquisitor they were working with.
Also mantis warriors with a death wish to redeem chapter honour.
ChaosSmurf should I play The Witness?
Could have been it or maybe its dark eldar sequel.
Nvm its about Dark Eldar.
Or will I just get mad?
Warrior brood may have been the tyranid one.
Oh wait might be Warrior Brood.
Oh gods you got a Goto book. Haha.
That makes sense as a series naming scheme.
Same author and probably a prequel/sequel to the other one.
Hm fun my irc crack stopped working there for a moment v.
And yeah it got quite trashy during the 2nd one.
So far never touched a book by C.S Multilaser Goto.
Doing other GW delving. AoS still has Archaon. Only this time they get to make Â£100 a pop out of this as he gets a fuck off massive hydra for a mount!
Yeah that model is not a good redesign.
Horrible models is 50% of AoS.
All of the stormcast eternal figures are garbage.
Well yeah the Sigmarines were a bad idea from the start.
Yeah but a bad idea could at least have good models I could use for bits p.
Rules seem pretty okay though from matches I've seen at the cafÃ©.
I am assuming that any Mordheims renewals will be using that ruleset in some fashion.
!mtg into the maw of hell.
Well it would be.
A stream teaching MtG basics White... white loves cats and soldiers.
Makes sense I guess if you look at the cards.
Still not exactly rocketing up.
Bought some nail polish at the weekend including topcoat.
Turns out the topcoat bottle is empty and I can't find the receipt because I'm bad at keeping paper stuff.
ChaosSmurf I'm being informed that people actually still use Alara shard names and Ravnica guild names as shorthand for colour combos???
Def still use the guild names.
Cant say Ive heard that at the cafÃ© or I might just not be aware of them.
I'm sure I started post-Ravnica.
And never heard them before watching this video.
I've only really played duels origins.
And I played in Alara and haven't heard the shard names since though like 3-colour combos outside of specific sets/blocks is waaay unlikely.
And i've heard of simic and boros etc.
I generally just hear them say colours.
And occasionally some more specific terms pretty sure one guy has a deck he calls American Dragons.
Noelor scumbag andromedon runs through the wall under a squad of advent. All 3 take fall damage xD.
Unfortunately I failed the objective and had 2 men nearly dead so I just evac'd.
The good thing about hate groups is that they are usually hilarously inept.
Sadly right until right to the moment they're not.
Well after the remains of my vodka and surprisingly only one beer I have read everything translated in that manga on that site CA.
Loving it so far.
New giant robot o.
Out with work tonight.
People keep referring to it as a lads' night or boys' night and I'm like.
Agressivly paints nails pink ?
I should tweet my nails.
They aren't pink but I did paint them last night.
Are they rainbow? each nail a different colour?
That would be boss.
Anathema I do not have enough paints.
Just do what I do go whenever I'm in town and pass my GW I just impulsively buy a paint I don't have p.
Stop paying GW for paints.
They are good paints.
Has that tweet actually gone.
Plume is so bad.
I can't see it.
Its a nice purple colour.
Its weird how much some colour on some nails completly changes your perception of a hand.
MoonWolf the thing you did for me for github doesn't work if you load the PR in conversation view then clickt he files tab btw.
'cause it doesn't load the diff until then so the elements don't exist I'm guessing here.
Yeah it runs on pageload.
Wouldn't happen to have a PR with a conversation i can experiment on would you ?
Not a public one.
Going to have to hook something.
Time to find out what.
There might be a url / history event raised because the url changes when you click on files.
Its working on this page.
Hmm maybe its because this page I'm looking at is massive? maybe GH load small file changes automatically but delay large ones until you click files ?
This one is 2 files.
85 files 4k additions 1k deletions for example.
Going to add a urlchange hook and let you try it.
Belatedly GW paints are actually good they may be a little overpriced but they aren't garbage. Same deal with their brushes btw! Also they are non-toxic which is nice.
And i need to stop it from firing on multiple elements more than once >.>.
Anathema try this see if it fixes it.
It should but i can't actually test it on your stuff.
It sjust the same gist as before.
Anathema it's Friday ayyyy!
Anathema got in Black Desert Online beta last night it was so full of people that questing was impossible.
Anathema i swear 90% of my javascript knowledge comes from greasmonkey scripts.
Ftrbzzs what is it like?
Anathema it was very pretty and shiny.
MoonWolf I can't even remember how to install scripts in vivaldi p.
Didn't really get into combat yet but it seems interesting.
Anathema but the English voiceovers are _so_ bad.
Like they paid someone 5â‚¬/h to do it level of bad.
Anathema it doesn't use the chrome greasmonkey plugin ?
MoonWolf you don't need a plugin.
Not for chrome either iirc?
You don't Need it.
But i'm certain there is one to help manage and write the scripts.
MoonWolf it's actually a sort of iridescent... turquoise?
Kirisu looks purple to me i'll take your word for it t hough.
Yeah I can see why.
I have to look at my nail from the side to see that colour though.
Head on it's turquoise.
It's p cool though.
MoonWolf you can drag .js files into the extensions page to install them.
Oh thats easier than i thought it was.
Maybe they changed that since last i tried too.
Its been a while sinc ei've used chrome.
MoonWolf seems to work o/.
Enjoy the ability to hide things.
Don't understand hwo its not a feature already.
Its trivial to do.
But what if its actually a Bad Game anathema ?
The classes are race AND gender restricted it seems?
According to wikipedia there is a Plum class.
Wtf does that mean.
What is a Plum.
Ok it looks pretty.
Opening a webm on my phone stops music playing.
Even if there's no sound.
Also I can't tell how pretty that is at this resolution I don't know why I tapped it tbh.
Because humans are curious.
Anathema I actually always pointed my brushes with my tongue never mind lips.
So yeah good thing Citadel paints are non toxic.
Also y'know marketed at kids.
Minister some reading up on other things has lead me to some people saying they might not be non-toxic anymore.
Enjoy your mouth cancer.
Their website says they aren't toxic and forum post was 5 years old.
Maybe they changed recipe.
Shade paints are now double size!
Those are the thin ones right?
FF8 LP just got a new summonï¼Œ song with the chance to name it...
Fucking MoonWolf talking shit to me online.
Anyway I keep to ask if you'd watch the Brode stream.
Your terrible at this game.
I did watch most of it.
Thought it was fucking hilarious.
Didnt'watch the last fragment.
Where he was going to arena.
Really wish someone had the archive for the tutorial.
Yeah I had a look around but couldn't find it.
I wanna watch him play Heroes too.
He has things to say abuot hearthstone i care about.
Heroes not so much.
Only because he was probably bad.
Better than me at HS tho.
Hard to say when he's playing rank 20's with a starter deck.
Yaaah but arena he was better too.
And he saw lines I did not see.
And clearly had Game Plans.
I mean I would hope he is better than random dude who plays his dailies really.
God you'd hope so.
MoonWolf Changing the capitalization of NuGet package IDs breaks package restore.
Expansion announcement is 99% at GDC btw.
There's a press event just beforehand.
We're not invited so I'm mad about it.
Press event is the 8th.
ChaosSmurf you're not exactly the biggest deal when it comes to games press.
Should have gotten in with rps for that.
We are equal to or bigger than RPS on a large number of metrics.
We're the 2nd or 3rd biggest PC site there is depending on what you measure on.
I actually don't know if RPS are invited either I know EG are and I think IBT.
Yes but in the publics eye though ?
I'm also better than anyone else they might send from the UK.
With the exception of Chris Thursten depending on the game.
And anyone if it's heroes.
Who the fuck are IBT.
It probably isn't them.
They've been teasing that this set is going to pretty major.
Taht would make far more sense.
I'm more excited than i was for loe at least.
I really liked LoE.
It was a good set.
I think it was the best adventure for Cool Cards that Actually Did THings.
Which needed a whole additional set of cards.
And better than TGT.
To make its dragons actually work.
Loe is basically Reno and Elise to me.
Oh and it made anyfin can happen paladin a thing.
Yeah that deck can fuck off.
Hoping next expansion has a few more good Discovers.
That mechanic needs to be evergreen.
Or perhaps a deck search version of discover.
And imo they should replace all random effects with it.
Here is three random cards from your deck with discover-ish constraits so maybe 3 dragons or 3 spells.
Pick one shuffle the rest back in.
ChaosSmurf so i've thought about the new formats thing a bit more.
Blizzard should really merge a number of cards into the basic set.
Like a few solid discovers and a number of critical class cards.
There is a painting guide on dakka dakka that starts with.
Light or visible light is the portion of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light has a wavelength in a range from about 380 or 400 nanometres to about 760 or 780 nm with a frequency range of about 405 THz to 790 THz. In physics the term light often comprises the adjacent radiation regions of infrared at lower frequencies and ultravioletat higher not ...
... visible to the human eye.
Anathema starting from the basics then.
MoonWolf heh I am the exact opposite.
The basic set should not be evergreen.
Everytyihng should rotate nothing always in standard.
Except maybe the cards you earn from levelling up but even those I would rather they rotated them.
Kibler explains it better than I do because he comes from exactly the same place with more experience and a video camera.
Yeah but if they Are going to have a permanent set of cards.
You should probably let paladin keep their good secret and muster.
And let priest keep their only good low mana drops.
Every start of the year set.
Will need to fill those niches.
And then wild baloons out of controll with 50 different priest 2 and 3 drops.
You don't want Paladin to keep muster.
It's like the best card they have the whole point of rotating is to stop that kind of thing.
But without muster shielded minibot.
They don't HAVE an earlygame.
Exactly they get a new one.
That's the whole point v.
May have to swap to 3 if this goes ahead o.
As much as i hate advertising.
Its basically just gong fuck you pay us to advertise and make money at all.
Looks like it's not GDC.
Embargo's on the 9th.
Could also be that they have a thing on GDC anyway.
Anathema there is no help.
Have you tried asking for public abstract help ?
Public sealed class FailedDelete FailedChange Titem> IHaveId where Titem class IHaveId.
Oh snap Sunstone vol 4 is out. I know what I'm ordering next week.
Someone movie that thing.
Instead of 50 shades.
That'd be neat yes.
Could also be that they have a thing on GDC anyway.
Bad Blood episode of x-files is /amazing/.
Why not just roll + con ?
Roll two oh con roll toucan!
My dm once had ninjas glide in on kites shaped like clouds and their reinforcements showed up as hiding behind a prop hill.
That reminds me of two things.
I should plan for sundays game and secondly I am still impressed my players managed to crash land a city.
I am not sure we have had a single flying vehicle in our games that has not crashed sooner or later.
1934 Bad Blood episode of x-files is /amazing/ <- they made an episode of the X Files about a Taylor Swift song?
GlennCuddlefish>> is your game taking place on Bespin?
Finally find a blue I like.
I prefer my version.
The true purpose of taylor swift's songs is sinister. Very much like anglets.
So yeah Genestealer hybrid models next week.
She needs to be wary of Jack Sparrow.
Thats the honkyest black pearl I've ever seen.
Honkyer than this?
I swear to gods there is something wrong with these loot tables.
Sounds like me when I was playing the basic Dungeon Siege campaign p.
Pretty much constantly junk with retarded stat attribution have a suit of plate armor suited for wizards. Except their strength progression is awful so they won't be able to use it.
I mean those are not bad as such its just that I need defense more.
And I have had those drop 5 times to day alone.
I rarely got plus strength gear in my run. Which was frustratring because it had the highest health gain.
Also I realized this week I almost want to replay Diablo 3 but still not in the mood to pay 20eu for RoS >_>.
Now I am not saying you should give grim dawn a try.
But you totally should.
Eh maybe later. I still have two more DS campaigns to finish and so far the LoA has been a lot better.
Camera issues aside the loot has been a lot more generous to me even if the voice overs from your partymembers get grating veeeeeeeeeery quickly.
Whoops meant to do a dungeon ended up in one of the randomized bonus dungeons instead.
Wanted to do undercroft ?
I was meaning to go to old arkovia.
Ended up in steps of torment instead.
Well its not randomized but one of those needs skeleton key to unlock places.
Maybe you should pick them up.
If there is one thing I like with DS1 it is the transmute spell. In LoA they even made better versions of it which was nice.
Mostly because the game hates vendors with a passion it seems so being able to turn junk items into gold even at a slight loss is nice.
So I've been farming for a piece of gear for about 2 hours now.
Finally got one of the mats to drop.
This component is at the third floor of an undead infested dungeon rare drop took me some 5 runs to get one to drop.
Go craft the gear and...cant.
Check the component 1/4.
The cult models aren't too bad though.
The DW marines though? They're just marines really and for some goddamn reason they get a bike too.
In other strange news my mother threw an add for security guards in my lap today in an obvious implication that I should try it. Why I have no goddamn clue because there is no way in heck I'd even pass the physical requirements.
These are rad.
The deathwatch models are alright all the marines are stereotypical of their chapter ofc. Hopefully like Calth only the characters are monopose and the random troops ie genestealer hybrids are regular multi-piece sets.
Wouldn't count on it though. I'd assume its closer to DV than anything.
But we'll find out next week retail price is apparently $165 though.
At least its nice that Blood Ravens get a small nod for once.
So probably Â£95 like BoC then?
1116no way in heck I'd even pass the physical requirements for a security guard <- I mean you're tall enough to just be imposing anyway though?
Yeah most security guards are just /large/ don't look like the kind that need to run a 6 minute mile p.
I dunno the guy walking around in town looks pretty damn fit to me.
Not to mention I am the worst at dealing with shitheads anyway.
Noelor it does seem unlikely.
There must at least be one or two bi girls there.
It's an all-girls school so I guess there's no way to prove that.
And then bondage adventures at the weekend.
Sercret societies slave auctions.
Wtf even IS this school.
I mean the adventures were off-camera.
I just got a pic of my girlfriend and subordinate tied up while fully dressed.
You let someone else tie up your girlfriend/minion.
You are the worst.
Mairnai come try to watch me save da erf =D.
Mairnai come listen to yourself!
I'd awtch but got friends over.
Noelor I have no idea what even.
MoonWolf this game has a cheevo for Tempt a Straight Girl.
Previews of Warcraft Chronicles. A compilation of all the lore from the creation of Azeroth to today.
MoonWolf TIL Wet Work in guerilla training school is retroactive.
I bought it and 4 dudes earned a promotion.
MoonWolf TIL Wet Work in guerilla training school is retroactive. <- yup its great.
!note MairBear If you have some time at some point i have an observe daily in HS.
The word overwatch is getting a lot of work this year.
In addition to the game and the game mechanic it is also now the codename of the hacker in Arrow.
GGG path of exile devs should announce an mmo called World of Wraeclast for april 1st this year.
Because Oracle was taken actual on-screen justification.
<- fucking MODS.
I'm watching Legends of Tomorrow the DC/CW ensemble tv show and I am constantly just thinking.
I think you'll find the question is *when* are we?
And when is that ?
When will it be good?
Important info thread.
No pangolin thread 0/10.
Noelor MairBear i've been informed through a dev stream that sectiods can raise mimic beacons.
You mean kill the beacons and then turn them into zombies?
Zombie Goasts Leave This Place.
Dorn is old now.
Q got old too.
I don't have too.
Noelor btw I can't do Exalted on the 5th >_>.
You mean the 4th? o.
I can't do the 5th either though p.
Some hots caster I follow posting a twitpic of his new cat and I'm pretty sure he has the same ikea desk chair as me just diff colour.
Ikea desk chairs looking the same perish the thought p.
Ikea unifying the world through furniture with silly names.
Of which 90% of the world can pronounce properly anyway.
The chair before this one was a Markus.
I think even I could pronounce that one.
Though my U might be a bit flatter than yours I suppose.
Segueing into a One Piece laugh.
Not if the chairman gets his way.
The future is here.
Sword art online lan party.
That is some amazing makeup skills.
King of the Moon Crystal.
My one wish in life is to have Elias Toufexis' voice.
Anathema my wish is for Monday to be over.
Ftrbzzs not going well?
Anathema super sleepy weather a bit poop.
Got a bit bored of painting last night so I started assembling my knight.
How tall is that thing ?
The legs alone are about as long as a Leman Russ.
Cooked_Auto did you know in 30k solar auxilia lists Leman Russ BT/Exterminator are /fast attack/ choices. They get Outflank as base and can be Fast vehicles for one turn in a game o_0.
Not really since its 30k and Superheavies were a lot more common.
Space Marines sitting on the objective sir what's that behind that tree? *a leman russ squadron pops out*.
Cree- no wait shit. Too early.
Just getting outflanked by the superheavy tank.
Leman Russes arent super heavies. They're just tanks p.
Also the SA /transport/ is 13/12/11 armour *5* hull points and can get a Demolisher Cannon.
Isn't it the biggest 40k tank after the baneblade ?
Land Raiders are larger and there are Forge World tanks that are in between.
If I had lots of money and time I'd love to do a 30k SA army.
Anathema you only have money and no time?
Â£70 for 20 men.
20 men who will be like 200 points tops in a game that is usually 2000+ points.
Maybe if I was splitting Cambridge housing cost with someone else I could afford Forge World but not atm.
Reading about SA they sound like everything 40k guard should be though.
Well they are the origins of the IG if anything but loss of production facilities coupled with the necessities of the time made them go from an elite force to something more common.
I mean how they play.
Anathema check these out tonight.
All of those are broken.
Except mage and warrior who are broken in the bad way.
Mairnai they are supposed to be broken.
MoonWolf they added a tickbox in Roll20 for Use window popouts for Characters.
I'm in Janos' game rn but I imagine it makes that the default?
Probably a per game/campaign setting.
Apparently not even mods.
Jesus christ what a day.
In chronological order Overslept I have no painless limbs broke my portable headphones bus left me off at the wrong stop fell over broke my PS3 and as a cherry on top of all that I found the only bus stop in this city that does not have a bench.
At the end of the day I just gave up and retreated to my parents place for some basset therapy.
GlennCuddlefish looks like new girm dawn update any moment now.
Top 15% of today's daily in Mini Metro.
I just pulled of a Blockade Movement action.
I am soooo happy.
I keep forgetting that even exists.
This is the second session of the fight.
We spent the first session getting really annoyed by her.
Thats one hell of a fight.
3 infernals and a 2CD who summons ghosts vs 4 alchs and the Empress.
Anyway between sessions I was like oh yeah Blockade exists.
The empress has provided valuable counterspelling!
What circle is she casting at? second ?
Non-akuma but with mantle.
MoonWolf I just hope they dont nerf my build to the ground.
What are you playing at the moment ?
Spells or melee ?
Tanky enough to survive melee but only spells.
I think you'll be fine.
Because as far as i can tell spell builds are under represented vs melee's lol anything with soldier.
So i don't think they'd nerf them.
Huh. Because this feels too good to be true.
Not that I dont die often enough but still.
Hoping my summoner doesn't get wrecked too hard.
Maybe they fixed pet AI.
Hah as if.
My friend has been having stability issues with his pet build.
Or also in single player ?
I assume single player.
Perfect timing on that one as XCOm2 players on Skype talked about Balaclavas P.
Yeah that last mission.
Mechanically it was fine.
But the level was pretty chuggy.
Not suprised it glitched out for some.
See also the teleport out of level Noelor had.
Either that or the last death didn't end the mission.
It was showing alien noise indicators though.
As we were both not looking when the teleport would have happened.
MoonWolf last panel.
Oh hey grim dawn is patching.
They removed my farm route.
Literally removed that road is gone.
Huh. its actually closer to a portal now.
Sadly the dungen layout seems different now.
I'm pretty sure they either nerfed survivability or made everything do a lot more damage.
Doubting tha later since my pet keeps exploding all the time.
GlennCuddlefish I wish I hadn't read the altext on today's Poppy.
Threat generation has been updated Debuff effects and Damage over Time now only generate threat on their initial application. Rapidly attacking a target now generates reduced threat. Reduced the amount of threat transferred from pets to the summoner. Increased the cooldown at which certain mobs and bosses will attempt to ignore pets.
Didn't thnk this would happen.
GlennCuddlefish i have not read the full patch notes.
But you probably feel squishiers because they rebalanced every affix in the game.
No item is going to be exactly the same as before after this patch.
Oh and arcanist defenses got hit pretty hard.
I can't find my tiny magnets.
GW have a contest on the webstore atm you enter buy buying at least Â£50 worth of stuff because ofc.
One the prizes is their Â£500 terrain thing though so I kinda wanna enter when I get paid this month.
Spotify devices thing now doesn't require the devices to be on the same network.
What also helps is that metal is very... mutable ?
It spawns subgenres really quickly.
GlennCuddlefish they fixed pet agro!
My pets can actually have some.
What level is your pet build moonwolf.
Going to be 61 in a moment.
Hm. pity dont think I have anything in that level range thats not also a pet build.
I've been saving up gear and stuff to see if i can make either a 2h lightning druid or 2h warder.
Also I think one major factor in my sudden mortality is that I forgot to take into account that buffs probably work both ways.
Dots do crit now.
Yeah that probablyw orks for mobs now too.
You had arcanist on there right ?
Because it got some of its defenses nerfed.
Right that character is now revered with everything but whatever those loonie undead guys were.
Eesh. even warden is giving me trouble now.
...spotify just froze my PS3 -.-.
Life got a bit better after I sacrificed some 10% of my lighting damage to survivability.
Life got a bit better after I sacrificed some 10% of my lighting damage to survivability <- just 10%.
Thats not that much.
Dropped from 1000% to about 900%.
I thought you meant just 10%.
Not 10% of total.
Well yes but alternative was my damage dropped 100%.
ANN article blurb just about the best.
We have known for a while now that the Stasi was maneuvering to make a power grab and that does finally take place here in episode 7.
Its a Gravity Falls shirt.
You're a Gravity Falls shirt.
So is your face.
Gravity Falls that's where I wanna be Living in Gravity Falls.
Well that's dicks Youtube has apparently closed down Team FourStar channel because of copyright strikes.
SunTiger not sure if I feel cheated or cheaty... but I just did XCOM 2 last mission and when I got to the final room... the aliens kept skipping their turns after a long pause. I think the AI broke.
MairBear try again ?
I mean I won.
Did you really win ?
Steam why did you give me -75% off of a game you know i own.
Maybe you enjoyed it enough that given a discount you'll buy it for a friend!
Slept 8.5 hours was amazing.
Anathema welcome to normaly.
Anathema oh man sounds good!
Wish I'd sleep more than 7 nowadays.
Anathema there's a massive building site now across the road from our place and they work from 7am to almost midnight now.
Disturbing my sleep -.
SunTiger more than 8 hours is not normal for people who work full time! I average 7.5 hours a night and according to microsoft I sleep an hour more than average for my age group!
Ftrbzzs surprised that is legal o_0.
Anathema I suppose there are noise levels they can't exceed.
But I'm a light sleeper.
Ear plugs? I have a bunch of disposable ones I sometimes use in summer when it is too warm to keep the window closed since the A14 *always* has traffic and I too am a light sleeper.
I should try ear plugs again but I've failed with them before.
We'll see might just get used to it.
I wish C# had decent tuple support already creating named types just to pass two values back is annoying.
Ftrbzzs btw I'm going to be on holiday when the PoE expansion is released so you'll be able to get a head start.
I see the people at boston d ynamics are still assholes to their robots.
The magic of humans.
## to you too.
Not a video about the colour balance in ds 3 trailers.
I'm not even watching now you've told me that.
Pity because the cover song is pretty good.
Games still on for tonight right moonwolf?
Sometimes this tools isn't so good.
Hey manticore i need an encounter for a party with 3 level 8 characters vampires and shadows and whatnot.
Also an option 1 shadow dragon 20 shadow thieves.
So we are playing but are we actually starting on time?
CookedAuto that is totally out of scale =/.
It's cute if it's a tiny Gardevoir.
If it's a giant Joltik less so.
Lack of other indicators means you can imagine it whichever way you want.
Anathema Oiled up hippo against oversized scenery cute yes/no?
There are two boulders.
Urgh turn on ps3 -> you gotta sign in to psn -> you gotta change your password -> connection to server timed out.
Urgh turn on PS3 -> hardware error.
Actually its one of the original PS3 models so no.
Also smacking against stairs would not have helped.
So its the size of a medium sized child and uses a lot of power?
But on the other hand I didn't have to pay for any games.
I'm just slightly annoyed because that thing would probably still be functioning if my friend had at least warned me that he hadn't salted his stairs.
This shake is sending some serious mixed messages.
Whey and lactose are separate I would guess.
Undertale spoilers talking of Napstablook.
Once again I've forgotten my password to the nishkriya vm p.
You are so good at this.
What are you changing ?
There's a new writer added her to the db and was going to give the web-app a kick to see if the posts would get picked up.
Since I think I knocked the scraping back down to an hour?
May try knock the VM down some sizes see how well it works.
Azure is slick currently resizing at the click of a button.
Well its booting again.
Cheapest tier there is 0.25 of a cpu p.
Cpu percentage today 3%.
Taking a while to start though.
Maybe that size doesn't have enough memory.
Yeah I resized it back up to one the same size as before but without auto-scaling lol @ out traffic levels.
Its allegedly up now but I can't get the website or RDP >_>.
Yeah its definitly down.
Did you break it?
Azure broke it! I can't even get RDP.
Whatever you did to azure broke it.
How did you even break a VM that simple.
Well I hope it fixes itself over night I need to sleep.
Even my sober tanks like they're drunk.
So pathfinder is on humbel bundle darn darn good value.
Shame about the game itself though v.
The Life is Strange LP is creating some tense polls holy fuck.
MoonWolf today on Numberphile a man is seriously into calculators yo.
Needs an unboxing score thoug.
Oh thank fuck nishkriya is alive.
I slept like 4 hours could not deal with that shit today.
It was up like 3 minutes after you went to bed.
Well we have 3 pages of text from the new writer now o/.
Hope thats not a real name.
We reached back into 2015.
Nishkriya is the 11th result for Lucy Darling on DDG.
Not even on the first 3 pages of google.
Give it a moment to index!
Its had 8 hours!
We're the top result for nishkriya still though.
Anathema holy shit that forum needs less new announcement boxes.
I really need to rewrite nishkriya on top .net core and nancyfx.
Bet it would run on a cheapo linux VM then.
Its a shame web development is the worst thing in the world.
Also I have no idea how to host web apps in linux without having to deal with apache.
And apache is worse than iis.
Another slick thing about Azure when I tried to login to the DB last night to add Lucy VS was all you don't have a firewall rule for this IP want me to add one? and it did and it worked! as in Azure had no rule for my home ip -> db server.
Ftrbzzs don't you well yeah me!
All my trip planning for nothing _.
Jks I wouldn't even get my money back.
MoonWolf would you take another feature request for that github plugin?
A wee thing I can click to hide the box at the bottom 'cause I have to scroll all the way back up if it is a very large diff eg a new file added that is over 100 lines.
I'll see what i can do later.
Their line thingies are just tables you could add a footer.
Hell copying the header into a footer would do.
Oh the top bit isn't part of the table.
Bonus points if it scrolls back up the page so the next file is at the top.
Looks like each diff container has a unique id so could focus the first inside that area that should do it.
Window.scroll is a thing too O.
You could just do it yourself >.>.
Maybe tonight can't play around with it at work.
Anathema works currently looks pretty shit.
Any clue what you wnat it to look like ?
MoonWolf.
Ugh adding an svg element through JS.
Just use an emoji.
A 'x' is basically what I imagined.
Anathema what i have now.
Want me to bother moving it up into the table proper.
Or is this good enough.
If you could remove the border / background on the button and make it about 25% smaller than would be proper.
I'd have to fight githubs own styles for that.
I'll se what i can do.
If its a pain don't bother.
Stripped out the github classes.
Instantly looked like this.
Link? can't seem to get to someones gists from their github profile page fucking github.
Anathema you can get to gists by just putting gist. in front of github.
I'm really tired >.>.
Doesn't have the correct mouse icon and scrollbars push it outside the viewable area but otherwise its great D.
Well you can poke it yourself later to fix that.
When you are not so tired i suppose.
I don't have access to massive enough PR's.
>open PR for review 115 changed files.
Anathema dun dun duun.
Anathema 8 days until ascendancy hmm.
PoE needs that thing from D2 where loot shoots out of things in a stream.
Man PoE is so great but I get bored of it after a while.
And then it's super interesting again.
Anathema remember to kick me when ascendancy is out.
So far I've managed to resist giving things Fallout themed names while doing this atomic changeset work. SO FAR.
Your self control is commendable.
MoonWolf Welp SA is getting DDoSed.
Did the mods probate the wrong person again?
They chose to fuck with THE WRONG GUY! >|||||.
Its the revenge of the Dangan ronpa paywall.
Someone is angry about nto reading lp's again.
DDoS easier than spending 10bux.
Testing out my new winter clothes by sitting around the house in them without the heating on I cam very warm and comfortable.
Anathema you could just go... outside ?
Don't have a computer outsidee.
I can't do exalted next week 'cause I'll be skiiing D D D.
Dunno somewhere in germany.
Germany rather than Austria?
Well flying to munich and getting a train that would be a long-ass train.
Finished firewatch with friends today. It was a good experience for a walking sim.
Pity the ending fell kinda flat.
I heard there was some action at some point ?
And not jus twalking and talking.
Must have missed it.
Too much watch not enough fire amirite?
As I said it was a good walking sim. if thats your thing I do recommend it.
On a scale of 1 to dear esther how good a walking sim?
Well I did not like dear esther.
I actually lost in double action boogaloo.
It was to one of the few players I respect in that game.
Even if he did scrub it up at the end by using super slow-motion.
Why do I have a dropbox link in my closed tabs titled Pigsmoke.pdf.
Oh it's a PbtA game set in the Harry Potter universe.
Powered by the Apocalypse.
Still doesn't explain the name.
It's set in the USA.
At the cheap American version of Hogwarts.
Still tink its a dumb name.
Damn lost second round to him as well.
Still pretty sure I can beat him if I play just a bit better.
I dont know I think an academy full of redneck wizards sounds amazing.
Worst part of grim dawn.
Doesn't finish loading stuff if you alt tab.
How do I disable all your fucking emails at once instead of 4 fucking clicks per publisher.
God I love Community.
I don't believe in evil but this school clearly got a finger up its butt as a child.
Britta is the best.
Dark Souls every NPC laughs at you edition.
Thats basically how darksouls npcs.
The undead model in this game is real cool imo.
Every NPC competes for creepiest giggle you mean.
Hey some are genuinly nice.
I'm watching this still ongoing Vicas LP very very slowly.
And have no other experience of this game.
He is very enthusiastic about it.
So BlazeBlue CP arcade mode has taught me that only -some- plot elements are now weird time bullshit.
Every other thing? Relius did it.
You'll eventually find out that Relius was also weird time bullshit though.
He's definitely caused a lot of weird bullshit of time. THere is plenty overlap.
But things fall into those 3 categories.
How petty am I to put back a PR because there is a variable called 'areInvalidValues' ? p.
Anathema I think the word you're looking for is 'professional'.
MoonWolf its bad grammar!
For a boolean that is true when there is one or more invalid values.
Its not the biggest problem in the world.
Fine I'll find a real problem first p.
That makes the dark souls fires even more apropriate.
MoonWolf you should put your github extension on github btw.
I should put it on greasefork.
Or do both i suppose.
I don't see it under your repositories.
It was a joke.
Which is a github thing.
Sorry still drinking my coffee.
The dumbest thing is that my most popular github thing is still a tiny hexchat python script to work around a very specific windows bug with 1 specific kind of keyboard layout mostly used in my country.
Also your profile pic is still the old house symbol.
Yeah i guess i could update it.
You need to get your social media presence in line m8.
More people care about fixing a hexchat bug than a okay-ish markov chain lib in .net.
Cough medicine has too much bloody sugar in it.
The sugar is half the point.
Thats not a joke.
Everything is too sweet these days |.
Anathema is turning into a grumpy old man.
Anathema why isn't there a button to promote a gist into a repo.
MoonWolf in ninject right.
.SelectAllClasses doesn't select all classes.
It excludes abstract ones.
Shoulda called it SelectAllConcreteClasses |.
Anyway enjoy your ability to star it i guess ?
Probably make dumb issues.
I think we have a memory leak on large grids 1000 records.
A chrome process is currently using 24% cpu and 1GB of memory.
And trying to go into edit mode is taking multiple minutes p.
Anathema don't mind if I laugh just a little.
Also Chrome loves memory.
Ftrbzzs laugh away normally there isn't more than 50 records at once and paging is used.
I just tried it for the lulz and to test atomic changesets on lots of records.
MoonWolf how'd you install your addon in chrome? click and drag what I use on vivaldi isn't working.
Troll'd chrome dev tools crashed trying to collect a trace.
Anathema saw that interesting.
And they'll be moving to Salo that used to house the mobile unit for Nokia -.
And we go rooound and rooound and rooound.
Mostly linked because they said they'd use Sailfish and I remember how much you loved your Jolla device.
Yes.. they're wonderful. -.
Hope they get to run it on better hardware.
Anathema I've seen Jolla _once_ out in the wild.
If you don't count mine.
Anathema is a sneak forrker.
Bewildered shrug is a pretty good gender.
Butts VS crashed and lost some of my work.
Also Tumblr has a terrible page titling format.
Anathema shoulda saved mate.
Minister yeah well and this is purely from a technical and ui viewpoint tumblr is terrible.
I have mentioned before that it is terrible on my phone.
That reminds me that I should explain å°é•¿'s gender next time they show up.
Which isn't until mid-March I guess.
Not all of us read moon runes.
I'd be as bold to say less don't than do!
Also the few of us who do read the wrong kind.
Trees flower earlier -> I get hayfever for more of the year.
Though I have a solution for you..
*looks at all the ice outside*.
Get a remote job and then strategically move 4 times per year so you can stay in autumn weather perpetually.
I hear Alaska is nice this time of the year as well as iceland.
Also Pokemon SM. P.
As much as I like the look of the Commissar coat I probably wouldn't want to get one. Mostly because it'll be not great quality for a full quality price p.
Would legit consider a commissar coat p.
Of course you would.
Omg Adam Jensen jackets.
Also finally got the copy of the 3rd edition 40k rules I won last weekend.
MoonWolf I know you can Google å°é•¿ to get a literal translation is the thing.
Will that get me something meaningfull tough.
Also if Mair knows any kanji he'll know å°.
->.
MairBear come hang out on ze mumblez.
Wtf even is music.
Our brains are nonsense this is nonsense.
How is it nonsense.
It goes against his paradigm of music.
Also too used to skypes editing feature. Christ that is good.
I just don't like random sequences of sounds having such control of my mind I.
So does random instances of smell too so.
Welcome to the human psyche. It's a very fun place.
I mean there is a reason why food stores have fans that blow out air over fresh bred stalls and such.
D Sorry doing last minute things with brother makes mumble hard xP.
Fighting Rocket by moonlight.
Finding shinies by daylight.
Never running from eye contact.
She is the trainer Pokémoon!
Not sure I saw any real difference between ultimate and elite nemesis loot.
Was it easier to kill ?
I was able to facetank it.
However I havent actually killed any nemesis on ultimate since the patch.
So will have to find some of those.
MoonWolf I heard you like hard turn-based games.
I also like pretty graphics.
GlennCuttlefish on FFXIV ladies day this year. We have to help the powerpuff girls become a band.
Well they are a band we need to make them popular.
Are they at least lalafells?
One of them is!
The one that's totally blossom.
I would hope at least one of them is a catgirl of which I 33% approve.
Today in exalted we found a dock where water elementals were gambling on illegal fighting. And it was filled with a clone of one sailor So I arranged tables and found wine. <- My summary to a friend who asked how the game went.
GlennCuttlefish we're done rpging.
Hoorah. Will hop on mumble in a bit.
Well change the channel to be precise just listening this first.
Huh. accidentally closed mumble. Which is fine since I need to go make some dinner anyway.
Hey anathema when you get a moment please could you correct the mumble channel to Rowdy tavern? D.
At 1-2am local time? Man and I thought I did meals late...
He's just like that.
Pfffffffff we've both done worse.
Mairbear has fucked his sleep so bad he's had dinner at a normal dinner time.
Crazy week that was.
Starting to suspect watching this xcom stream was a mistake.
I thought how long can it last I'll just watch it and go to bed at reasonable time.
Around 8am the streamers GPU starts melting.
How is this viper so adorable.
How am I awake in the morning.
It's still a horrendous monster.
Noelor should I make a male or a female XCOM double?
If you can render me from a female starting point do that.
The flow rate over Niagara Falls is at least 100000 cubic feet per second which is actually mandated by law laws are crazy.
50000 at night or during the off-season.
Noelor what level is your character at ?
Lets see if i can catch up to that.
Any chance you could hitbox it? o.
Not right now because I'm watching things on the other screen.
But mebz in a bit.
There we go all farmable achievements in XCOM 2 farmed. B.
MairBear a man after my own heart.
Now it's time to scan till avatar project completes to witness the game over xD.
MairBear gameover is pretty disapointing.
At least it's a thing but yeah if it happened to me before I saw an Avatar.
I'd have been upset they didn't show me one.
Yeah it just gives you nothing.
I dunno what to call this one and it's not really what I think of when I think Noelor.
But it's either gonna be The The Noelor Noelor. of The Noelor Gaming etc Or Noelor Cheers Love ...somthing? Should I just use actual name?
Noelor The Noelor Noelor.
I have made it so.
Oh shit it's the 27th and I haven't got round to getting a Mew from GAME yet.
Will I care in the long run cos right now I don't actually mind if I let it slip...
Also stream's going up.
Noelor apparently the thing is being given out at GAMe until.... tomorrow... x.x Providing the only local branch has a code left in the first place B Also about to dropbox the Noelor-attempt.
<- Updated XCOM 2 character pool.
GlennCuttlefish new song with two videos.
I need a Ok Go and World Order colaberation project in my life.
One of these days!
Progress in art would be swifter if I had not mastered procrastination at an early age.
Bang zoom straight to the moon.
Cooked_Auto>> there's a pastel hair repeat offender doing your melodifestivalen this yr.
Cooked_Auto can you please send the animes to the finals.
I'm all for more animes in Eurovision.
That would require me ot watch it so no.
Oh yes I now remember why I dont like being awake at this hour.
Impossible to sit on my computer half the year.
I need better curtains.
Good gods beatriz overseers updated like 3 times in 2 weeks now!
The power of computers.
I am truly disgusted by that first one.
Not a fan of the atlantic herring.
That networking thing is neat.
Atlantic herring pastasausages just turn my stomach.
At times like this I wish I could predict what my players are going to do in todays exalted.
If they go west we are back to playing romance of hundred kingdoms if they go east we are in for glenns wild cannibal ride also lunars who may or may not be cannibals.
Or they could throw me a curveball and either stay at the city doing something stuck on the mountaintop or go north/South for mountain adventures and I dont even know what I would do then.
Just prepare some suddenly ninjas.
Is there a proper high res version of the ex3 map?
I'm uploading it to the dropbox exalted 3e folder now.
I was trying to mark down the territories my players hold but the other map I found got too blurry once I zoomed in that far.
I still wish i had an even higher res version.
But this one is nice.
It'd be a ridiculous size though.
MoonWolf lots of immaterial spirit stuff from SLS on nishkirya recently.
FF8's pretty hardcore.
Didn't see that ocming.
Neither did the target.
Great. my ex3 pdf has gene insane.
This level of competence is the absolute l n l hl rhv l n wnt g v r1j through a combination of skill special-8on srt-.
I hope restarting helps.
This is amazing.
Smithsonian institution of polite sass.
Sounds like it might be latin.
Is basically the only qualification you need for it.
Lucky me got a weeks extra planning time since one of the players has to be on call for work and one player is off sick.
Now I just have to figure out what to do with my day until I pass out around midnight. hopefully pass out at midnight.
Actually no before midnight. around 11pm.
Good gods I might actually have to eat my dinner around 8pm.
33% chance of 36 energy leech retaliation over 2s.
So... 1/3 times I'm hit my enemy will give me mana for 2s?
I might take that if I actually find myself wanting for mana.
For now I've maxed my first skill elemental weapon which also gives mana regen so hey.
Anyway this is what my basic attack looks like now.
Noelor doing some sidequests in PoE today while wathcing HS but when you finish let me know where you ended up and i'll make sure i get my arcanist around there.
So we can coop in the future if you wish.
I'm actually about to go into town.
Get Mew curtains.
I love the fact there is finally anime to watch this season with a new Macross series Girls und Motorbikes and the Phoenix Wright anime.
Well and more Jojo.
Because anime has just run out of good names.
We just call it.
After the things its about.
No its really called Bakuon.
But its about girls who likes motorcycles.
MoonWolf just got out of the Undercity.
So no real plot progress.
Also features Stig's Japanese cousin.
Did a sidequest of killing ghosts for a necromancer.
And a couple bounties.
And his skeleton buddy!
Relatively few skeletons going on.
Though all undead now hate me so that's nice.
But yes this is pretty much Girls und Motorcycles featuring Stig's Japanese cousin.
Also yellow nail polish.
So I can now represent the Saints if I need to.
I'd venture to say that the only good games in the engine are Monsterhearts and Apocalypse World itself. yowch.
Help this school is haunted by lesbians who insist on interrupting my class.
GlennCuttlefish looks like bad grades for you.
Grmbl guess I have no choice but work along the undead lesbian agenda.
Well if you didn't want to why would you even play the game about lesbiand school ghosts.
Maybe I really like japanese school roofs?
Clearly your negative viewpoints is hurtful for the undead lesbian community and you should apologize.
What are they going to do.
All those stories of guys being so bad at dating that the girl turns lesbian? Ghosts.
I have friends who say the same thing about elves v.
I'm still upset they censored this move in SFV.
Its okay you can get it back via a mod.
Releasing content ahead of Long War is cheating.
Fucken Moray lettin the team down.
I painted a man today.
Now edge highlight that shit.
There is some close-white with white highlights doesnt photo well.
For some reason I keep thinking that Poppy will suddenly become KLK whenever I see the latest update on co.
'cool dad' Chrom is the best incarnation of Chrom. Indeed.
Oh my god that is just so faaaaaaaaast.
Glenn whatever you do. Do not buy Stardew Valley.
My lip is certainly numb I just wish my tooth had been.
Had that once half of my face was numb just not the tooth they were drilling into.
Fuck thought I'd get paid today since it would be the 1st stupid leap year.
Last night I learned that WP will ping notifications at you while you are in the middle of a call and that instagram for WP will notify you everytime someone likes one of your pictures and that changing the notifacation settings in instagram for windows phone doesn't work.
Check out that sexy robot.
Is it this sexy ?
Sex robot sex robot.
Thanks it's stuck in my head now.
Let's find out if grimcalc works on android!
Minister did it work.
Did it crash your phone.
Apparently the answer is yes but it breaks AndChat and stops my music for some reason.
Really 16 points into shadow strike?
Either one or 16.
Minister that reason is probably memory usage.
I'd go for 1.
Also on the dual weild line i'd only pick up the points in passives untill they cap chance to use.
I need to look at Devotions on the pc.
That gives you a total of 25 points.
You can invest into maivens.
Or into some passives.
See whether I need a good r-click to bind one to.
Maybe have more of a fiddle later when I have a mouse.
Minister know how i complained about the text in the devotions not fitting the box.
They pushed a patch that changed some font stuff.
And now its fixed.
I guess all their QA was on 169 or something?
Nah i think its cause i changed my default ui scale.
You know of the game that's been in effectively public beta 2+ years.
Hm. Pity I dont think thre is actually a way to make my warlock ultimate viable.
They don't have much mutual synergy.
Also since it was my first character i wad dumb and didnt put nearly enough points into vitality.
You could go blood of dreeg + curse of frailty form occultist then elemental exchange line + reckless power.
With some defensive skils.
And then just mostly rely on good items.
At this point its probably best to just start over with a warlock.
GlennCuttlefish god the demonic endgame dungeon thing is horrible.
Its boring its all thes ame.
And it takes forever.
MoonWolf my atomic changeset transaction has grown to a 550 line method + some helpers.
Your face is too big.
I'm okay with the size of my face.
Not with the size of that method.
Mfw I have a type signature over 100 lines.
List IDictionary IDictionary ChangeSetValidationResult>>.
Thats a lot of nesting.
Like a bower bird.
Maybe even more than that.
I just created a Facebook chat group for my family.
To share the very important news that we all have birthdays on the same day of the week this year.
Usually dad's is different.
Hooray for leap years ?
I am human therefore enjoy coincidences.
It's not even every leap year it happens.
Oh maybe it is.
My memory is awful.
Think of it this way.
I think ana likes dates.
Anathema how do you feel about dates and date math ?
Dates are a delicious fruit and I enjoy the company of beautiful ladies but date math can fuck off.
Though I don't think you should consider hanging out with ladies synonymous with dating.
That's a little toxic.
Well I don't date men soooo.
Yeah but you should interact with women in contexts other than courtship.
You can do that? O.
It's actually pretty nice.
Something something friend zones?
I can't tell if you're intentionally being ridiculous or not now |.
Yeah I meant Noelor.
My mum appreciates the birthdays lining up leap year thing at least.
Good news everyone Scarlet Blade that bad mmo is shutting down.
I have informed CS.
I am listening to a conversation about whether or not to subscribe to porn blogs on tumblr.
It lasted for like ten minutes.
Well? What was consensus did they reach?
Was it really worth it or not?
Shut up we're supposed to be playing Exalted.
MoonWolf other consideration is more ice than sword ?
I think i prefered the more sword than ice.
And devotions for that matter.
That build looks like its being really awkard about its synergy between nightblade and arcanist.
Ice devotions is like.
Two constellations on opposite sides of the page.
Stab devotions are much more focused.
Because you can just invest into straight up Good Melee.
With maybe some ice procs.
Though tbh it's just elemental on the arcanist side.
S'just that the only element Nightblade uses is ice so.
If I'm going to buff an element it'll be that.
It uses the elements of ice sword and piercing.
I don't think Elemental Exchange considers sword and piercing to be elements =P.
Shows you how narrowminded Iskandra was.
...this is not what a jackal looks like grimcalc.
Not sure why you are blaming grimcalc.
This is obviously on crate entertainment.
I don't believe Grimcalc.
When it comes to Devotions.
It's not very good at them.
Noelor shouldn't you be exalted-ing.
Nothing much is happening so I'm checking these constellations.
And also how much I can afford to refund of the skills I don't want.
Barely even sure these devotions work.
You didn't save those devotions.
It works but some more defenses wouldn 't b ebad.
Maybe some empty throne ?
It'll be fine for now anyway.
You have a plan.
Which much more than normal ever asks for.
Wolverine gives more purple.
And I'm exactly where I need to be for Unknown Soldier.
P much all those little creature constellations are for affinity.
Between US and Huntress.
Hm. guess I was right about my build doing less damage now.
Someone did comparison between a video the builds creator posted and what he could do in the same gear turns out he is doing like 20% of the damage on the video.
Thats a bit of a nerf.
MoonWolf I think Veil of Shadow counts as an attack.
So you can bind devotions ?
Because I'm just standing next to the target dummies and the 5% chance on attack frostbolt from my gloves is being shot at it occasionally.
Which is a pity because I really like this build. Unfortunately its just too slow for proper farming now.
I can't bind devotions to it though no.
I'm down to just one devotion now =<.
What classes does a gunslinger build use?
I'm guessing at least demo.
Noelor i have no real clue.
I never wanted to use guns.
Why would you even play this game if you don't like guns.
There now I have a 100% rep increase scroll for all but one faction waiting for my pet character.
I swear I'll find a build idea I like with actual active skills at some point.
Well that was a round.
Kill streak of 106.
What are pet builds? Occultist/Shaman?
Is there any equivalent to skeleton army?
It just looks like a group of singular buddies.
What a boner kill.
Hm unexpected design.
I don't know that I get it.
Could be wrong but to me that feels like an Illiad reference. Which feels out of place amongst a Death Note and Trigun shirt v.
Oh it was Vikings. Derp.
MoonWolf enemy that fell into obvious secrets 3 times each time told me well played.
I don't know how to respond to that.
Hopefully I'm not too hopped up on painkillers tomorrow.
Still in a lot of pain ?
No but I have another dentists appointment tomorrow.
Finally getting rid of that wisdom tooth for real.
Just missing the big cast ensemble picture.
So yesterday i made a foxhound unit name generator. for reasons.
But we killed Big Dice Boss.
But we killed Big Dice Boss <- and ever since that fight i'd planned to make a more robust version than the internet on i found.
Because this one.
Isn't nearly as good as mine.
I knew it it wasn't the real Big Dice Boss we killed. MoonWolf Kojima'd us.
Oh shit einstein what are you doing.
I mean I guess its kinda safe if the recovery is long enough.
GlennCuttlefish gonna main pythagoras.
You know how at times when you are trying to fall asleep.
Can't stop won't stop.
Your brain goes hey remember that really dumb and embarrasing thing.
I've been having that all day. One after another. What the hell.
I was planning on being sober for a week again just to see if I could and I think my brain has had enough.
For some strange reason I've had that happen less and less when I find myslef just yakking about things with people on skype.
I guess having a really dumb discussion with others before crashing to bed works as a distraction vOv.
I find alcohol and audiobook to be more my style P.
I guess that works too.
Even if I prefer to go to sleep with music on instead of people talking.
Meanwhile in lesbian ghosts I am going home and taking my loli with me.
Music doesn't distract me enough I've noticed. Unknown audiobooks take my attention span too much.
Which is why I usually go through discworld books.
I just like music at night as background noise mostly.
>not sleeping in absolute silence.
>Implying I sleep to the speakers belting out heavy metal at high volume.
I dont think I even could sleep to absolute silence at this point.
The tinnitus alone would drive me insane.
Okay that wouldnt be the case for me I'd just find it discomforting.
They teased that earlier with just a pic of the necron lord.
Had multiple levels wondering just fanart? last stand hero? full race pack? dow3?
Pretty sure DoW3 is low on priority right now.
It's like smurf and his advance wars.
Though I do wonder if the sega creative assembly relic umbrella resulted in dow staff transferring to total warhammer3.
I assume DoW3 is low priority because of Total Warhammer.
Not to mention DoW franchise isn't mentioned at all in the SEGA survey that is going around.
./r/totalwar was hilarious in the last fortnight when dow won the 'make war not love' event.
I will say this much on the topic of visual novels Undead lesbians loses to cripple fornication in the musical department. Audio quality in general I'd say.
Then again katawa shoujo does have an amazing OST for some reason.
Well that was a terrifying amount of pathfinder to get for $18.
Remains to be seen how much of it will see use xD.
Time to vote leave p.
Yep. Sturgeon said herself a week back that if Scotland voted to remain while the Union voted to leave another indyref would be on the cards.
Mandarin tones rising high falling wobbly.
Japan moomin and bonus puns it's most of the things glenn likes in a single thing.
Here's an interesting contrast to that search terms map.
That is however specifically for pornhub thoughÂ¨.
While the other map is most likely a more general search.
It... literally says on Pornhub.
Something something one-handed?
The rest of the U.K. is 1647% LESS interested than Glaswegians in seeing porn from Glasgow. this is perfectly fair.
Well you know British traffic.
Some of these are amusingly specific.
What better way to ensure to get what you want?
Oh that's all one image.
Bottom chart top item.
MoonWolf do euros have lower than 10c?
Never seen 1 or 2 c coins.
MairBear i played a match in which i picked coins on death and the opponent picked bananas.
Dont think I have either.
I got to turn 4 and played a violet teacher.
Opponent conceded when the turn was over.
Anathema they are not really making 1c or 2c coins anymore and many places do not accept them.
MairBear you just saw the end of a 25 minute match.
The last 10 minutes of which was me winning.
And the mage taking FOREVER.
Going do something else for a bit.
Oh no these sports lesbians are actually trying to steal my loli.
GlennCuddlefish is getting bullied by jock lesbians.
Its the worst MoonWolf.
Every time I think of going to videogame generals board on 4chan I remember that katawa shoujo general is still awya.
And then I go away.
Because that frightens me.
Huh not a symbol you see that often in most programs.
Cooked_Auto the power of unicode.
I can dig it.
I guess we were both wrong.
I don't think hawaii even came up.
Cooked_Auto I watched the first part of the trailer that was setting up the premise.
Then stopped once it got onto here's our whole plot.
But it seems aight.
I'll go see it whatever.
On account of being such a skeleton.
Noelor lemme know if you want any help on grimest dawn.
I got a new poisonous sword.
And suddenly monsters are just exploding.
Welp DS1 finished more or less.
46 hours in total playtime. Not bad.
Noelor somehow exploding doens't sound right for poison.
Well started lisa on our thursday games.
MoonWolf Elemental is just the three fire/ice/lightning right?
I got a devotion shrine and it levelled up one of my active devotions.
Didn't know that happened.
They give you some xp.
Your devotion skills just level from gaining xp.
I thought it was use.
I mean effectivly ?
You use them to kill things.
That is not actually a crocodile.
That is really not a crocodile.
That the gaping dragon.
Grmbl keep losing in DAB.
I mean logically thinking I should not get so upset considering how few people can regularly beat me but.
Maybe this twitter will calm you down.
I dont think it can. I just watched the ghostbusters trailer.
No sir this friendship bullshit is not helping.
In fact its making me angrier.
I might even be actually upset soon.
After that ghostbusters trailer my summer is ruined.
In fact the best thing I feel at this point is I can do is to find somewhere where people also hated it. I am betting I can find such a place on /tv/.
Assuming I can survive all the shit memes to get there.
I can I really have no plans of watching it.
Yknow I don't think I've ever actually watched the original in full start to finish...
So was terribly meh from the start over the reboot.
I don't know you. I mean I really don't but if I did this would be the point there I disowned you.
It's k I could live with that.
MoonWolf fuck the Conflagration.
Slippy and Grippy the Frog.
I can see why you avoided it the other night.
Is there a shrine somewhere in this mess?
I got some shoulderpads on my way to that quest.
I think they may have leaked in from WoW somehow?
You could say so.
Noelor I'd say so yeah.
I've been spending my evening creating this.
Formating is terrible i know.
I'm actually caught up on Vicas' DS LP.
Thats enough fucking about with text generators for 1 day i think.
MoonWolf I keep helping people into and out of caves and they keep being murderous.
And I keep having to kill them.
Stop freeing ancient evils from caves Noelor.
Use your power of dynamite wisely.
I add milk to mint tea.
And there is nothing you can do to stop me.
GlennCuttlefish It's Incredibly Upsetting.
You know what other kind of tea I have with milk?
And so much sugar you can hardly tell it was once possibly healthy.
Why are you even putting tea in it.
Well sometimes I just think its too late for coffee.
If its not too late I usually have coffee.
Which I brew by carefully boiling the water.
And then adding instant coffee.
You are some sort of beverage barbarian.
Screw you god not even cutting my internet can stop me now!
This podcast's content which I think went over skype has the cast recorded in real-time signing in to their discord server shouting hello? down the line to the discord with it being picked up and cycled by multiple audios.
It's truly productin value.
Do they just not know how to podcast.
Because it snot hard.
You just record everone seperatly through audiorecording software of choice.
It's their 'christmas' episode where they got drunk on stream.
MoonWolf physical damage now makes up 5.0-6.5% of my hit people with a sword damage.
Which is winning frost or pierce ?
Physical is actually lower than when I linked it on Sunday.
Oh no you've lost physical damage.
Noelor works for me ?
The bit on the right just says Loading... forever.
What version of chrome are you on ?
Whichever link I click.
I just installed the lastest because i didn't have it installed.
You could try updating ?
I also tried disabling adblock but that didn't help.
It shouldn't make a difference.
Oh I only just noticed the topic.
What is the character bookending the OtS session?
Because its song lyrics.
Because i'm a huge nerd.
Noelor i found out why chrome broke and yes updating will fix it.
Also i need to change it anyway.
Because fucking the rest of the browser world doesn't support it.
I am sorry friend.
Its hardly your fault.
This sure happened.
Noelor great now gryphons are telling people to check their spellbooks more.
Oh AndChat can render ðŸŽ¶.
Wish hexchat was better.
Next Ex3 session will be a demon fight.
Do you want it tonight or next week with everyone there?
^if you could please paste that when mair shows up and discuss that'd be swell.
Beat Takeshi has been cast as Chief Aramaki in the Ghost in the Shell movie.
In the butt ?
Oh hey a MairBear.
Well in the list anyway.
Kirisu you rang? o.
<- I don't know how or why but I'm sure coyote is behind this.
Minister> Next Ex3 session will be a demon fight.
0933 Specifically both Dawns.
0932 Do you want it tonight or next week with everyone there?
Also a week might mean I get a chance to put actual effort into stats and finally balance the familiars so MoonWolf's dog isn't killstealing.
Last night I got a character concept stuck in my head which is horrible for a couple of reasons.
But I want to play an exalted campaign where you steal the imperial manse.
I'm fine with whatever.
GlennCuddlefish you will be excited for the exalted campaign i plan to run once i .. finish.. those others ones.
Its a series of heists you start with stealing peaches from heaven.
Hopefully I will have run out of lupin the thirds to watch by that point so I dont end up outright plagiarizing something.
Ok I'm putting the game off to next week then.
If anyone with a real keyboard could change the topic.
And we'll have Ana and hopefully consistent familiars.
Bug me about it tonight.
MoonWolf I just did the tanking challenges of the Hall of the Novice.
If people pay attention to those.
Then we will have no problem with tanks till endgame.
Is there even incentive to do them.
The reward for the final quest though? A riing of +3 all stats and 30 exp while at or below level 30.... and my lowest is 31 V.
EXP gold and some nifty level 15 gear.
They should wall off level 30+ dungeons behind them.
Theres a training thing now?
The npc in front of the dungeon will be all like.
Show me your tanking/dps/healing license.
If I equip that ring with the recruit-a-friend feather in level 15-29 dungeons it'll still work.
Yeah Glenn part of the new mentor system too.
Basically people who have finished a lot of the game Need 300 commendations need 3000 yes 3000 raids dungeons guildhests and so on completed.
Oh yeah they were introducing something like that. Ehh. Sounds like too much of hassle. also subscriptions. Also would like to actually do stuff with my life that is not mumorpegers.
Also one of every role at max and other things too.
Oh and I still have to try that one mumorpeger with the mechanics.
The one with the mechanics.
Blade and soul was it.
GlennCuddlefish dinged 80 in grim dawn btw.
Noelor your problem with viewing should be resolved.
Ty you letting me know it was broken to begin with.
I thought I was finished with undead lesbians some 7 hours ago.
I am disappointed with bonsai's Chinese name generation.
What is the issue ?
Though I can 100% understand why the things I'm disappointed in are the case.
Or guess at least.
For some reason a whole lot of character building scenes unlock after you finish the main game.
Not alternate branches ?
No branches in this VN.
Well there kind of are but those are unlocked with the extra scenarios as well and they only affect which extra's you unlock.
Well thats wrong. Choices in main scenario decide some of the extra scenarios you unlock.
I wish at least some of these extras had been in the main plot line I am enjoying at least one character a lot more after reading some of these.
Who needs sleep ever again right?
Final boss in new FFXVI dungeon.
I am pretty sure I killed a whole lot of those in drakengard 3.
Noelor a way with words.
Mm nah got a much better gen 1 starter tee.
MoonWolf pick one of Ko's single-target attack boosters to lose.
MoonWolf I played some GD and am up to the rift just inside Darkvale Gate.
Someone's starting a run on WoW where the controller scheme is two dance pads.
Noelor swooping descent i suppose.
So somebody made a fan version of the ghost busters trailer.
Its somehow better than the official one.
Just recut it over the original music I see.
And removed like half of it.
Including most of the bad jokes.
CGI is still there unfortunately.
Oh for fucks sake.
I guess the new music's longer.
MoonWolf pick one of Ko's single-target attack boosters to lose.
Grmbl I'll finish this stupid VN today if it killes me.
Noelor swooping descent i suppose.
Is that not the one I crossed out?
Crossed out where ?
Do you not get to see formatting?
You should have an email.
Well still shadows is now a beast.
I haven't even changed that much.
8 extra damage dice ?
Thats quite a few.
The whole combo stuff to give it a decent hit roll is there to start with I just made it more obvious.
That's a lie I also made SS a lot tougher.
Yeah i saw a lot of red numbers in the main statline.
But i can't check originals.
So i figured it was just a few points up and down when you said it wasn't much.
Like the spider's definitely been buffed and way harder than I nerfed your two.
But it wasn't very complex and was mainly focused on damage and resilience.
Which y'know the statline is from a housecat rather than an actual spirit exalted might fight.
Spouses should no longer run away into the dark abyss. <- some grim patchnotes in stardew valley.
Goddamnit game now I want sushi.
Sadly I think I cannot afford that meal today.
I found a shrine I can't restore =/.
While it looks like a nice bag lets be real here.
6 beers? Not going to work.
Would be enough for me if anything but then again I'm not finnish.
Well six beers and a small flask.
I've been watching MGRR while playing Grim Dawn.
And keep getting items with Raider in the name and reading it as Raiden.
Raiden Axe of Alacrity.
Raiden items do lightning damage and have runspeed.
Make it happen Crate.
I'm now at level 40 and Fort Ikon though.
I can coop with you then.
K I'm going to eat and then I'll boot it up again in host mode.
I'm going to have food in about.. 30 minutes ?
Someone asks Ben Brode what he thinks about VR.
Says he preordered both a occulus and a vibe.
Well I know what types of media he is going to be consuming.
Or did you mean vive?
Oh come on I'm sure that was the last extra scenario.
And then 3 more popped up.
What scares me is that the last month still hasn't had any extras.
This game will never end.
One finally unlocked in final month.
Overall it was..Fine. Dragged on a bit too long some of the plot points were either poorly explained or dumb.
Except the sports lesbians.
Damn those sports lesbians.
GlennCuddlefish did they take your loli ?
In the end I took my loli and went home.
Welp I can finally uninstall DS1. I almost want to reinstall Diablo 3 but eh /.
Time for ds2 ?
HAvent bought it yet.
Oh wait. It's on sale now for 174eu.
I couldn't technically buy it with steam wallet funds if I so like because I have 188eu there.
But those are card funds.
You'll have to charge 2 euro to your credit card.
MoonWolf I now have actual resistance numbers for Vitality and Aether =.
Well you say that now.
But we are about to enter elite.
So Noelors resistances will not be massivly negative!
Guess I should do some farming as well to get my resistances up.
Now I just have to check which faction had those boots.
Homestead farm it is.
Except damnit I have good pet damage boots. not sure I want to lose those.
Dead glenns do no damage.
I am not getting hit all that much.
What faction level are they?
You know what bothers me about japanese names?
Or at least names in anime.
So many female names are male names in Finland.
Not being told how to write them?
Like Aki or Mika.
Aaaaaa I was meant to get some drawing practise done but I got stuck marathoning some stupid SoL anime.
Meant implies external pressure arguably.
But they're equivalent tbh.
Well I have marathoned through this dumb SoL thing. Now I just have to find my motivation before I end up clicking on another one on CR'.
Which dumb and stupid sol was it?
Well the name is def dumb.
MairBear behold the LIGHTPAWN.
Did I miss much?
I dont know. How long were you gone?
Odds are no.
Glenn didn't let lesbians steal his loli.
It was a hard fought battl.
Anathema how was vacation ?
It was good I ate a lot.
Also I'm rubbish at skiing.
It's not a skill that is called for too often in life.
Also nobody could queue correctly it was physically painful.
And I learned that is legit a question about queing in the British citizenship test I always figured that was a joke.
I always figured that the British citizenship test was a joke <- ftfy.
Wait how do you queue correctly then.
I just assumed its walk over there stand behind the last person move as required.
Actually if there is something that videogames have taught me is that you should only queue with a tank.
That is not what happened!
There was a third part of The Cannibal Diaries.
MoonWolf I've worked out what kept killing me in the Chthonic rifts.
There is an enemy type that sets the floor on fire.
But it's not terribly distinct from the background because that area has poor colour design.
And then compound it with the number of floor effects and characters we had around.
I've run out of health potions.
Problem with blazblue is that I have to learn to lose again.
GlennCuttlefish just play something easy like celica or ragna to ease into it.
I don't even care.
Guess I should pick up the basics with ragna or something.
I want to learn her. And hazama...
But I just got stuck on Terumi.
As in enjoyed too much. Rather than struggled against.
I should probs try tager with a pad as well.
So out of boredom I made my FC character in 13th Age.
MoonWolf/GlennCuttlefish what's the deal with these magic augments that show up at honoured?
They are a second thing that can be put on an item in addition to a component.
And they have to be removed by the inventor I'm guessing?
They are not removed.
Also they make the items soulbound.
Soulbound means it can't be transfered to alts?
So the faction writs can't be transferred.
What is even the point of them?
Only the 100% ones can.
The point of them is to give you some bonuses for your first farm of that faction.
It makes that last stretch not quite that long.
So I do know why but.
Imo they should have just... made it not so long.
Ugh I need tainted brain matter.
Time to stab zombies.
Nah I just found the smith who converts them.
Honoured with Death's Vigil \o/.
Not enough iron for the writ =<.
MoonWolf Oh god Mors is doing a Phoenix Wright LP.
I'm now down to just 20% chance of my weapon swings being real weapon swings as opposed to procs.
Its fucking 13C in my room.
MoonWolf that's my everyday @.
ChaosSmurf in case you missed this.
Ftrbzzs btw PoE Ascendancy has started.
Anathema I know we played a bit last night.
Anathema I made a range and Simon made a marauder we're lv14.
It's been good lots of rare drops from the beginning.
Haven't had the time to trade in any of the coins yet but will see how that goes.
Great now i can pretty print my text.
Its actually more like static analysis.
I was soo looking forward to another fable game.
Myeah sucks for the guys working though.
So I'm looking into ordering some new brushes and checked a paint supply store and went to do a test checkout. So the store requires a title. The choices are aside from the usual Mr and Mrs and such Dr and Professor. Or Other.
Please be an Other.
No point. They don't deliver to Sweden >_>.
And they're a UK site.
Wouldn't want to ship outside the Uk.
Strange europeans would buy from you.
ROW - Delivers to all other countries except - Australia New Zealand Sweden Finland Norway and Denmark What the Fuck.
And the US and Canada too is valid.
Wow they just hate nordic countries and the new zealand/australia.
New Zealand and Australia is almost understandable. But Scandinavia?
I have no clue.
Its not an EU thing since its mixed for that.
I just don't get it.
Lemme try the UK site then.
Can't even change country there.
So why put on Earth at all when it doesnt look anything like it because its 200 years after WW3?
This is a terrible trailer.
For a probably terrible game.
I don't think the fact that a Diablo 3 lead artist working on it is any help to it.
Maybe if they had a whole team as good as that.
This would be an okay game.
This is what happens when you let interns make trailers.
Pretty sure the artist guy is lead dev or something like that.
But hey you can get a freee keeeey.
I'm good without thanks.
I was making tea.
And then I noticed I have no milk.
Overwatch release date confirmed for May 24 btw.
Pity its going for what I assume is full retail price.
Open beta between May 5 and 9 though.
Will give it a try then even if I fear my computer wont run it.
They sent me beta for it but I fear my comp would fall flat as well.
Noelor finished very rought first version of solar generation.
Names are still just chinese.
Needs much more work for intimacies.
It has so many realm specific figures that right now it seems to mostly generate the personalities of dragonbloded.
Noelor it is a sign.
But favoured Athletics MA Melee and War.
Well if it was truely chung.
It'd favour dodge and resistance.
Sometimes intimacies get a bit weird.
My paramour Disgust.
Thats random for you.
Major Things will never return to normal I will die a rich man.
My best friend Bored Chejop Kejak Fear My paramour Love My wife Rage.
Shit son you got issues.
This is still Chung.
Who is also Physical tertiary.
To go with all those favoured abilities.
Chung is not going to have a good time.
I do like that due to how caste abilities work.
It tends to generate somewhat sensible characters.
Especially when i weighed the non combat abilities in Dawn a lot higher.
Maybe fiddle with dawn abilities on non-dawns.
So you don't end up favouring all of them.
On a con artist.
Anyway I have linked it to Janos' and my monday night exalted group.
So I'll let you know if they break it.
It still need improving.
Actually at least one should know how to actually github.
If he bothers clicking on it.
I only have 50 Principles wich is actually a really limited pool.
And it looks like right now i've not setup Defining to exlude from the other intamcies.
So it sometimes duplicates intimacies.
Someone managed Minor The Guild Angry My friend Joy The Fair Folk Loathing My uncle Terror My grandfather Disgust.
We can all relate.
House Cynis Sad hmm.
There is a lot to be sad about there.
Minor My brother Suprise Nechara Sad My son Fear My grandson Ecstasy My mistress Amazed well family holidays will be fun.
My twin Love My mother Terror even more fun family time.
MairBear real true HS card leaks for real.
Major Pine Trees should be burned because they are an affront to my god <- what the hell moonwolf.
Look you come up with a better one.
MairBear real true cards.
You can tell because the watermark is an arrow through the heart.
Which is definitly the symbol for the upcomming old gods related expansion.
I see what they did.
Maybe google is going to fix google+ by making anymous and require an image in every post.
Most of internet would be better with forced anonymity.
GlennCuttlefish nothing can make google+ better.
MoonWolf that would actually be an improvement.
Not that I would use google+ anyway.
Well tihs is a thing.
Yeah I heard about that.
From what I read on CineD that movie was special.
Why do you do this.
To make you wonder why.
This kaplan overwatch dev update. He talks about how he's really excited to give out announcements and yet he sounds incredibly depressed.
Well he wont be able to give out more announcemetns soon.
So obviously he'd be depressed over that.
BwaS probably because he's been in semi permanent crunch mode the last few months.
And its eroded his will to live.
DnD has left scars on the rpg world for generations to com.
I wish we were playing Fellowship -.
And soon pathfinder will take over that role.
But I thought ppl like dndnext...
DoB politics aside I have literally 0 opinion on DnD5.
Since when is that o lower case.
It moved in the opposite direction of dnd 4e and therefor i have no desire to play it ever.
DOB since my finger got lazy.
See that time I used caps lock!
I have no idea.
My attention is split.
MoonWolf TIL Acueid is summoned as a Berserker in one of the Fate spinoffs.
Noelor oh god Berserker Arc.
Thats a terrifying though.
She doesn't look very berserker.
Thinking about it Arc as berserker might actually be a downgrade from her regular power level.
If you can imagine it.
MoonWolf that's p much what the article says yeah.
I also discovered this.
Idk if that link'll work properly.
I'd prefer if you could un-discover it ?
If you level her up she gets clothes.
That's not how levelling up works?
There go my plans for never having to shop again I guess.
MoonWolf you fed all of Tuscatsi's own intimacies into this didn't you?
Someone just rolled We can probably solve that with more fire.
Not tf2 on purpose.
Something from the Sniper apparently.
Yeah that one is in there.
Also some TES/K6BD and some Uncle Iroh.
What's with the pine tree hatred?
MoonWolf channels his inner dwarf.
Noelor i crowdsourced it.
That forum doesn't even exist anymore.
But we preserved it.
... okay that HAS to be on purpose.
Anyway if you have any suggestions.
That would be nice.
Also accepting factions people places abstract concepts relations.
First suggestion is run ties through the same name generator as the well names.
That will also happen.
When i have a better name generator.
Instead of just chinese.
I dunno what your current list is.
But also defs generate HK wuxia names by running your chinese list through g-translate imo.
You just want literal translation names ?
I can make that happen.
But in-genre goof level imo.
Thats going to take a little mor ework than google translate.
But i can still make it happen.
Google translate isn't translating them probably because no accents ?
Do you have it set to pinyin?
Actully it was because i was using the google search page one.
Probably going to just have to make that namelist by hand.
MoonWolf Janos has decided that the pine thing is about Linowans.
Is github a reasonably way to just make suggestions for principles or is that silly?
That would be a bit silly.
Use a pastebin ?
MoonWolf someone got the same principle as defining and intimacy.
Yeah that can happen it shouldn't i'll fix it tomorrow.
Nothing a large influx of bees can't cure.
Tomorrow Dungeon World chargen.
Inverse World playbooks have been nixed so I guess I'm picking between wizard and druid.
There is a playbook for being a creature made of rain.
Which may be water rain but may also be fire or light or iron.
Anyway I will probably be druid?
Noelor i fixed the duplication and added the single amazing suggestion.
Because a halfling druid adds healing whenever the party breaks camp but also a chaotic druid gets xp from destroying symbols of civilisation.
Here have one of Little River's major principles I only trust tools I made with my own two hands.
Also A fight not won fairly isn't worth fighting.
Time for that bed place.
Same after I catch a Doduo.
Did you get the january mew in time?
And they had no Celebi keys yet when I went to shop on Saturday >C Stoopid GAME.
You snooze you loose.
*did pick up the last CE of Bravely Second though*.
I dont quite get how they went from default to second like maybe if it was bravely alternate or something.
I don't pretend to understand anything about the naming.
Also on Saturday bought Spyfall and you'll be pleased to hear BWaS drank a long island ice tea in honour of it.
Trying to think what brought long island ice tea out...
Like was it a drinks order in a bar locale.
There are a lot of bar-like scenarios in that game.
Tbh everything had a barman in it when we played.
I don't want to know and yet I do want to know what eskimo porn would be.
Only one way to find out.
So tomorrow a computer is apparently going up against one of the worlds best Go players.
Just what we needed in life.
A vn to date tanks in.
Had to sleep naked without covers and with the window open when I stayed in a town next to the alps but somehow this office in Cambridge is so cold I need to wear two hoodies. Bodies.
Jives with similar stories where refugees return home. Typically it's because they end up in countries like Finland or Uruguay.
I know finland is bad but..
Suck it finland you're just as bad as uruguay.
Once again due to a misclick I have googled google.
Did you find it ?
Yes and I also found the information I was looking for.
1 cup if 1dl so I drink more coffee than the average Finn a day.
Dungeon World has a class called the Immolator.
Which would let me play Ember again.
But not a sentient cloud of rain.
Or I could be Sami Kuidd the genderfluid halfling druid.
Minister wuxia names are hard.
Surname is going through iterations in my brain.
But i think i can arrange it so that every now and then it'll generate Invincible Sword Princess.
Otoh Civilisation is a blight upon the face of Creation Only the dead should be underground Only in death can people be equal.
MoonWolf you just need some templates like {adjective} {noun} {noun}.
I will not rest until lies dead at my feet.
Or get a bunch of combinable fragments and assembly gibberish names.
Unsure if that's truly valid as a principle but seems more than a tie?
It works as a tie.
Since its trying to achieve a goal.
It works as a principle*.
Rather than an emotion or similar.
So people at work frequently messsage me on skype to ask questions am I dick for not responding until they actually ask a question instead of just 'hi' ?
Though also murderous fury as a tie context.
I have plans for two word emotional contexts.
But first better names.
That's my approach on the sub-Skype we have here.
Anathema my morale gets crushed because day in day out hi is the only greeting someone gives me invariably followed by sup.
It's called Lync and is like midway between msn and Skype.
Minister lync got rebranded 'skype for business' your company must not have updated that's what I use.
It's even still lync.exe.
Anathema if it's someone I actually don't mind speaking to I sometimes respond with o/.
Anathema yeah the FAQs are all Skype-based.
Also uh MoonWolf... sorry for late notice won't be able to do Roll20 tomorrow. >.> Apologies also to Glenn and Noelor.
We got these PCs last year as well. Or maybe 2014?
Brother got his ticket booked for the end of this week so we're going to be doing things to maximise his time etc. Then it'll be back to usual.
MairBear if you somehow message me on my work skype I will respond enthusiastically.
I can grind another rep in Grim Dawn.
Minister we can just finish normal dificulty instead ?
Anathema I'll be sure to keep it monosyllabic and tedious.
MoonWolf or that sure.
I got the last shrine on Sunday actually.
Minister I would have expected it to auto-update but maybe it has to be done through AD. I used to have lync and then one day it was replaced.
I just have no idea what the gear breakpoint is for... Elite?
I guess you don#t have local admin rights either?
Hahaha local admin rights.
You should try stand-up.
MairBear good thing you saved me because I kinda sorta promised to play vidya tomorrow and forgot all about it until now.
Superhot why did you start up on my secondary display?
Primary display was too cold.
Move it away from the window.
But my primary monitor is right between my toaster of a computer and the amplifier.
Should be plenty warm there.
I just looked up from my writing and saw someone's monitor with everything minimised.
Literally the whole screen is shortcuts and files.
And honestly I'm only optimistically assuming there are shortcuts there somewhere.
How did this species reach space?
Anyone who has something other than the recycle bin on their desktop is a monster.
How did this species reach space? <- our GM likes Fail Forward.
So far I am not impressed with superhot.
It's not very hot?
The idea of slow motion combat and stealing your opponents weapons is awesome I agree.
But the problem is that I played a half life mod that did all that in realtime for years.
This just feels lukewarm now.
Minister I've not stumbled upon Invincible Sword Princess yet but i've managed Proud Sword Princess.
I hate doing annual review stuff.
<- this character is going to do great things to creation.
This is kind of neat.
Wait that STILL isn't a feature in steam?
GlennCuttlefish steam doesn't build features based on whats useful.
But rather one who wants to build a feature at all.
Also requires profile to be public.
Blizzard is adding actual useful feature.
Who took over and made a sensible thing happen I wonder.
Yeah but now rank 20 won't have utterly baffeling decks anymore after the first week of the month.
Huh. Today I won against that one guy who usually beats me in DaB. I do not feel proud since I had to use his tactics to do it however.
Beat them with their own plays then rub salt in the wounds.
Noelor more names more principles.
Tomorrow better emotional contexts.
Most important diablo 3 ptr patch change Legendary potions can now be salvaged and will yield a Forgotten Soul.
First impressions of DS2 camera controls are a lot better.
WASD controls for the camera this time around.
Scuba diver somehow survives being sucked into Florida nuclear power plant through pipe.
I am to which I find more horrifying.
Or that floridas nuclear plants allow you to just dive in.
GlennCuttlefish yeah seems like a security issue.
DS2 seems a lot better so far. The spec system is a good incentive to stick with your class if anything.
MoonWolf are you planning to add a save this character button at some point?
Save... how... where ?
I repeat where how ?
Atm I can take a screenshot.
You can select the text ?
Or copy + paste it somewhere I'll probably lose the formatting.
Look idk forget it.
I'll look into something.
I make no promises.
Tonight I played Dungeon World.
It was actually pretty great.
How was it ?
Someone had called dibs on Immolator so I couldn't be Ember.
Therefore I created Sami Suid the genderfluid halfling druid.
Because I was wondering aloud which consonant to use and the paladin said to just alliterate.
They have -1 Cha because they were raised by bears and wolves and hate civilisation.
There was a throne with a trap for whoever sat in it so I turned into a bear and smashed it to pieces then also smashed apart the trap that triggered.
My grandfather Sad oh no.
MoonWolf can it pick an ability that could have been caste as favoured.
It has two lists.
One is caste which it rolls on for supernal and caste.
And one is everything.
It rolls on that for favoured.
After taking off the caste results?
The results are all exclusive and go in order of supernal caste favoured.
Technically dawn has 3 lists.
One is equal weight for all caste and that determines supernal.
Onyx Contempt a person or the mineral?
And one is weighted heavily in favour of non combat abilities.
Wait... just onyx ?
It shouldn't do that.
It should've been onyx something or other.
My mentor Terror.
There might be a city named onyx now.
Oh hey you added Spiderman's motto.
It was always in there.
Ancient General Bored huh.
Failed Arrow Empress Rage well.
My grandson Ecstasy =3.
Onyx is in the list of places.
So its was a city described in e3 core.
Oh I managed to roll a Dawn with only one combat skill in-caste.
But it can happen.
Supernal War / Caste Abilities Awareness Dodge Resistance Archery / Favoured Abilities Sail Brawl Lore Stealth Presence.
I guess... its a good general ?
Punches people on the side ?
Quiet Peasant Disgust that's a little problematic MoonWolf.
You maybe want to switch to semicolons as seperators for the intimacies?
Major Everything looks better after a cup of good tea Liqiang Zhang.
Supernal Brawl / Caste Abilities Melee Resistance Dodge Martial Arts / Favoured Abilities Linguistics Craft Archery Performance Thrown.
So firstly I think supernaling brawl supernals MA?
They definitely only take up one caste/favoured slot.
Secondly lol Dawn with literally every combat ability favoured or caste.
Thats dawns for you!
Giant Sword the Mental primary Night.
Anyway it needs more stuff.
But at the very least it makes funny characters.
And characters you could actually turn into playable things.
If you wrote out a short description of how the various relatioships in the intimacies came to be.
I also like that adding names and relationships to intimacy posibilities instantly started making them feel very connected.
Even if i have no clue how or what.
These people definitly have Stuff going on.
Also some disfunctional relationships.
Noelor i blame you for the bloodthirstyness of some of these with you i will not rest untill x lies dead at my feet.
Defining Sometimes you've got to look the other way dayum.
Also I haven't actually seen it yet.
This on a Performance-supernal Zenith.
Defining I shall Reach Heaven By Violence Twilight Integrity supernal has no combat favoured but Dodge *and* Resistance!
I don't know why it broke.
But you are right.
Those things should have been replaced with you know.
Noelor technically if you get really lucky you can get someone with a spouse a secret lover and a paramour who wants to get married to someone and who wants to be in a happy relationship with two people.
Also Noelor any feedback on the wuxia-ish names ?
I like it even if a few of the nouns create wacky results =P.
I feel like I see them more in intimacies than names but.
Probs just because more intimacies come out.
Yeah my options were to either prune and check the list untill nothing weird could happen.
Or have many more potential options.
And accept some of them would be weird or bad.
Related to that is why they are either ajdective noun or adjective noun noun.
And never double adjective.
Because the rules for adjective ordering are.
Also technically and tihs will likely never happen.
You can roll a defining intimacy to wish to be in a relationship with scarlet empress And ebon dragon.
Tomorrow completer emotional context.
And possible title/accomplishment stacking on top of names.
So you can be Anmei Shek sorcerer supreme sage of the four arguments of virtue.

Both of the Wachowskis the Matrix Wachowskis have now come out as trans.
This seems exceedingly unlikely.
One of them in 2012 one presumably yesterday for it to be in the news.
I knew about the first.
It seems weird that both of them are trans.
Whats even the odds of that.
Are they twins or just sisters?
Just siblings a few years apart ?
I'd have to look it up.
Lana Wachowski formerly Laurence Larry Wachowski born June 21 1965 and Lilly Wachowski formerly Andrew Paul Andy Wachowski born December 29 1967.
Article about how nobody really knows the demographics here.
Estimates are all under 1% though.
<- someone really likes making custom HS content.
Mu there is a save button now.
Maybe town down the hashtags there baymax.
Someone once said Watchmen gave the comics industry a 15-year-long grimdark hangover. I think Madoka had a similar effect just for something even more ridiculous than superhero comics.
A good reason not to go outside giant floating hypdermic needles.
I'm not sure how I feel about the votekick system in DAB.
On one hand the strict requirements mean that its nearly impossible to kick actual cheaters.
On the other hand it means that I dont get votekicked half the time.
GlennCuttlefish which happent to you.. frequently ?
What votekicking against me?
MoonWolf I cannot achieve true joy untill Violet Dragon and I are married. >untill.
Look right english is bullshit.
Also got I cannot achieve true joy untill Ochre Magistrate and I are married. on the same person lulz.
Sometimes you have conflicting feelings.
You just have to deal.
You have extra spaces around the abjective on Ties.
Oh is it intentional?
It annoys me P.
I think it makes it easier to read.
Major My friend Loathing.
Its a random generator okay.
Anathema just think of MoonWolf whenever we make puns.
I could just write a javascript exalted 3 character generator.
But at that point its not very re-usable is it.
MoonWolf I wasn't complaining about the friend thing that amused me.
I have fixed the spelling.
Have you just like gone through famous media quotes to find principles?
Some are unique some are from other people.
Some are from the books.
So when is it gonna pick random charms / merits? D.
Merits is the most interesting one.
Its not going to pick charms.
I can think of merits.
But its not capable of spending out of a budget.
Just do like 2-4 then I guess and don't list what the level of the merit is?
I'm thinking preset matrix.
Yeah just go one 4 cost two 2 cost and 1 1 cost.
Then fill in merits that can fit like that.
Would things like Command exist in both 4 and 2 ?
Hopefully in the future we can just give people new arms.
Ftrbzzs where are you guys in PoE?
Anathema we just got out of the prison.
Oh I got ahead then >_>.
Yeah as I said we didn't play much -.
MoonWolf worry about being too far ahead of me and feel bad about it.
Ftrbzzs maybe at the weekend I'll get a second character to wherever you guys are at that point then.
Anathema we're having some pizza soon so might play a bit after.
I'm in act2 need to catch up with shatterwing so am rushing.
I'll hang out on mumble in case you wanna chat though.
California Food and Agricultural Code section 27637 It is unlawful for any person to make any statement representation or assertion orally by public outcry or proclamation or in writing or by any other manner or means whatever concerning the quality size weight condition source origin or any other matter relating to eggs which is false deceptive or misleading in any.
The Phoenox Wright LP is very educational.
Wait just repared that.
You can't describe eggs... at all ?
You can't describe them incorrectly.
California not allowed to lie about eggs.
Lie about tomatoes all you want.
That is some oldschool shit.
Cooked_Auto i'm not feeling the announcer voice.
Announcer voices are rarely great.
I'm attached the to UT one.
That is some oldschool shit <- old school? Press button for cool is now oldschool?
Pretty sure he was being sarcastic there.
You people and your coops.
Had a little neck thing that had some silica gel sewn into it forgot about that and put it in the washing machine.
The gel is now swollen as fuck.
Oh for goodness sake blizz.
No one likes randomonium.
You know it seems you shouldn't put a spell to produce corpses in a game with a spell to blow up corpses.
MoonWolf Desecrate only does 3 normally.
But they added a Cluster Trap passive this xpac.
Anathema ha ha ha what.
Cluster trap + trap + desecrate + vaal DD seems lulz.
And Vaal DD is amazing because it chains.
Also lags the game.
Cluster trap AND multitrap even.
MoonWolf yeah the engine is balls they hired like 3 people from that NZ game company that closed down recently to work on the engine.
That NZ game company ?
Cannae remember the name but there was one that went out of business this year.
Anathema that's positive news hope they improve the performance on a reasonable schedule.
Comment Congratulations you single-hangly nerfed Ã skill gem.
Oh that's handy thanks.
Performance improvement in 2.2.1 for perandus mobs.
Isn't this the kind of thing you run a beta for ?
They don't really run betas so the mechanics of the league are not spoiled.
And the issue with perandus mobs is a general engine issue that is just more obvious.
Hopefully no-one else asks me to do annual review stuff |.
Now that I've done my own and reviewed both people I work directly with.
Please do a department and company review next.
And also give feedback on these other two reviews.
This tumblr is full of images re-posted so many times the text is almost unreadable.
Anathema can you do my annual review?
Anathema 'performance has been great after they left in October! keep it up!'.
Cause no friction in the team.
Lol they already patched Vaal DD to be 8% instead of 24% of the enemy life.
The only redeeming quality of Lalafells are their naming conventions and the fact that Potato Tato is considered a 100% lore-friendly name.
Anathema that was quick.
Anathema they patched the wrong thing.
They should fix their idiotic tons of corpses for cheap spell.
MoonWolf that's 4 gems combined which is like the whole point of the game and much harder to fix without hurting other builds.
Nerf all the things.
Good news we nerfed a useful gem to be useless.
But we kept the enabeling bad behaviour.
This will never bite us in the ass again.
Yeah now it only does 1/3 of a the biggest bosses health in a single attack instead of all of it S.
Yeah the biggest boss... which is great... when its dead.
When you don't need to kill it anymore.
They could have changed the corpse stacking they could have put deminishing returns on the explosion chaining.
They could have put a limit on amount of corpses blown up per cast.
Those are also far more difficult changes than a single number.
And would have required a tooltip update.
Yeah but we both know this isn't going to get turned around.
Glenn only redeeming quality?
Thats what the quote said.
I mean its wrong.
But I just found potato tato amusing.
Its not wrong though.
Probably but not about lalafels.
Fact all the best characters are lalafell.
Glenn what about thancred?
While not as horrible as most of the company not the best.
Anathema great built 10/10.
So uhm does this game not have any sort of deminishing returns on cc.
Because this is going to make maps trivial.
How do you do maps oh my friends runs a build that literally just disalows monsters to ever move and he can't die.
And then i aoe the bunch.
Also fuck the lag.
That is only working because one of the Duelist ascendancy classes gets 'always stun enemies on full life' and has taken the totem passive to not be able to deal damage without totems.
And also get negative knockback distance somehow.
This is worse than the D3 grift CC lag.
Anathema does that mean they go forward when you knock tem back ?
Ok so I work in an office where most of the accounting is in an Oracle database.
Today one of the accountants discovered that Oracle had failed to properly account this week's main payment run.
So its time for lots of emergency paperwork ?
The reason why as summarised by the log was insufficient room in the heap.
Oh no it paid properly that's my team's job and we made sure of it.
It's just the digital ledger book isn't properly balanced.
Java ran out of memory.
It's just so shit.
Lets look at that.
Still born on 1/1/1900 xcom2 site.
Added Zip Mode gameplay option. While Zip Mode is enabled animation like step outs gremlin movements speeds are significantly increased. Normal movement animations are moderately increased.
Mimic beacon rebalance Price increased to 75 100 on legend 3 corpses on legend. Mimic beacons can no longer take cover and are guaranteed to be hit by enemy shots.
Wet Work is no longer retroactive.
Yeah i have n oclue why they did that.
Just do not understand.
MairBear one good thing though.
No more grazes on 100% shots.
Game fixed right there imo.
Too bad he's a tad out of the meta atm.
Bring him back in the meta.
He was out for a while as numbers scaling from his stacking Q didnt interface correctly with his self buff R heroic.
Then that got fixed but think I've only seen him in one top level game since at a lan in jan.
Team ran 'unconventional' siege build with jaina-kt both teching up blizzard flamestrike with range poke as opposed to more traditional close range burst builds.
Helped being on the map where stack-modan is most effective and the player being the one who brought it out first.
I like him when I'm with understanding teammates.
But due to my solo queue or lately with-brother-queues it's hard to stack up the q C.
Me every time I play conjurers/regen master heroes.
Rotate from mid to top on bhb for globe... oh the artanis laning there gibbed the globe minion first grabbing globe when at full hp.
What are they like.
Theyre like soz man you're not tuned to my khala frequency so cant hear ya.
Still happens when i play tass though.
Or maybe they just shun the GIANT ROBOT.
MoonWolf so the reason they did this.
Was to see if there would be leaks and if there weren't they'd keep doing it.
And you happen to knwo this as a fact ?
Yeah someone leaked it to me V.
I have the press-kit which disagrees with the bit about standard being next week.
Guess they just fucked it for everyone then.
It says Standard launches with Old Gods.
We'll find out tomorrow for sure.
I wonder if they're not getting it from th press kit.
Will read full translation in as ec.
They mentioned an interview with lead UI designer.
I think it might have been a autopublishing fuckup.
Since its gone again.
And tihs would be around the time that the tournament probably started proper.
And blizzard was done giving expansion previews.
But it feels right.
Nah that all matches up.
I know there was loads of people from Europe there.
There was some fansite with like 200 followers on Twitter there.
We didn't get invited.
Maybe plans changed at some point but the press kit I'm looking at says whispers of the old gods brings with it the new standard format.
I think its a good idea to start standard before old gods.
But they should have done it at the start of the new season.
Maybe they had to push the release date back since the presskit ?
Yeah ditto waiting until early may for standard would drive people insane.
Nah I have the late april / early may here.
Tbh brings with it could mean we are also announcing it coming at the moment.
Seems like an awkard way to phrase it though.
Yah but nobody who was at the event or hasn't seen the live stream is meant to have seen this.
Agreed it's dumb tho.
Oh god what.
*wasn't at the event.
ChaosSmurf well they can hide it on the site all they want.
CookedAuto fucking ancient evils.
Not sure if a dapper murloc is really necessary.
I'm suprised they have not brought back Dr. Boom as a boss.
ChaosSmurf seems like possibly 2 months would make this easily the longest wait between releases.
So i expect Something unplanned happened.
Yeah I think so.
I expect that thing about Standard is true.
Because the community would actually start tearing off their own faces.
I have 6 of the cards but I dunno where uploading them would be safe.
You'd prolly prefer to see them tomorrow anyway.
That wasn't a translation quirck.
They actually gave people cards ?
I guess they can do that now since they have formats.
And can just prevent you from playing them live untill they want you to.
Also side note on NDA stuff although i've said this in #coding more than once.
I'm not going to tell anyone shit but also don't take the risk.
They've got bigger problems than me now.
Anyway they're giving everyone three packs for free.
According to the press release.
I think the people at blizzard know that they can't make this disapear and since its only 24 hours early and mostly just a general overview.
Its not the worst thing.
Oh no they know its old gods the thing we've been hinting at and got revealed by our being painted ad.
And they know the card count.
Biggest thing is the delay really.
Yeah there's nothing to get in front of.
If someone uploaded the whole press kit it'd be an issue cause I assmue this is most of the stuff they're saying tomorrow.
I expect details on cards considering you've seen some.
Maybe MAYBE a game or two.
Good to see you for another few months.
There is no way they're just sitting the meta like that for 2 months.
Hope we're getting good brawls.
That is so insane if true.
No sir i do not like it.
I'd prefer the no new expansion standard.
This now is a fuck up.
Because people are going to be like BUT THE LEAK PLAN WAS SO MUCH BETTER BLIZZ-TARD.
MoonWolf omg some of the comments on this reddit thing.
Why are you reading the comments ?
Cos people are discussing who a 4th old god would be and then it devolved into Mysterious Old God 6 mana 6/6 Battlecry Put one of each Whisper from your deck into the battlefield.
Tentacally old god 6 mana 6/6 summon two 1/1 tentacles. warning tentacles might explode.
Do you guys want the text on C'Thun.
Or would you rather see it tomorrow.
Rather see it tomorrow.
I can wait as long as it's not literally Dr. Cthun.
Oh yeah if its dr. cthun tell me now.
Becuase fuck that noise.
And then I ccan still wait I'll just be very |.
While active players have 10 seconds to play their turn!
Only... it'll have stealth.
It's also not that.
I opened a nozdormu today.
MoonWolf stealth nozdormu.
I'm saving my cards now until the nerf stuff.
Cause I have a spare Ancient of Lore.
And I really need a Argent Champion lady.
Also fairly sure Summ Stone will be legit in Standard.
Good enough to climb to 5.
If its another 2 months i'll have like 70 80 packs worth of gold savedup.
Yeah I have 3.6k now and that's after buying a load of packs in the past couple of weeks waiting for a legendary.
I should probably buy GVG and Argent now until I get legends out of those.
I think my GvG legend pack chance is pretty high.
Are you literally just buying to hit the pity legendary timer ?
I would be to do that.
I was buying classic packs because I need classic cards.
And they'll be legal in standard and I like opening packs.
But I was waiting for the timer to decide what to do with my gold after that.
I have basically everything good in classic except sylvannas alexstraza and a handfull of epics.
I've crafted loads of epics.
But am missing some legends.
Don't think I have rag alex.
I guess cairne might become good again ?
ChaosSmurf i have a fanzy golden rag.
Didn't even craft it.
Think I've d/e'd all my golds.
Had a gold er.
I can think of a few cards as shield guy.
He might actually be good.
Depending on how many other healers they print.
Why do they keep bringing back this brawl.
I just conceded on turn 2 to a hogger.
Because its a great way to clear dailies.
Well my pack had keeper of the grove in it.
But i did 3 dailies today because of it!
MairBear do you want to play some RANDOMONIUM.
It'll be so fun!
Need to win for the week first but eh sure.
So Dungeon Siege 2 feels a bit like replaying Kingdom of Amalur because it feels quasi-MMO. There is no quick load or quick save mobs respawn and there is a respawn on death system.
Also health and mana potions are not instant which somewhat annoying.
But is it fun ?
Its okay so far.
A lot more engaging than DS1 pretty much all the lines are voiced.
The minimap is kind of iffy but I assume thats because of screen resolution more than anything.
Getting used to the different party controls and such so an adequate opinion might wait.
Oh yeah the journal UI is squinty.
It just makes it run on win 10.
C_A fingerpori is the best finnish comic.
It is very finnish.
Fixed a bug with the ... of Force Enchantments which could disable audio. I love programming.
Top ranked HC char in the new league got banned someone suggests because he was mapping for well over 50 hours straight ie account sharing a bannable offence.
That's.. not that long when you're determined to keep top rank. I've done stuff like that plenty of times myself. I hope that's not all he was removed for.
Get. some fucking sleep.
I used to play WoW for days on end while taking stimulants. No one ever found out. Until now that I've told the entire internet. o_0.
Character name was an MDMA refernece too.
For the guy who got banned that is.
MoonWolf re banning.
Lol thats not even against the rules.
Pretty sure thats one of those ones that goes into every eula or other such document for an online service.
Doesn't include details yet.
Just hey this guy has a 4 dot hearthstone.
Immortal Dawn defining I'm getting the band back to gether 4 dot artifact 3 dot command shit is gonna be fucked up.
MoonWolf I will die a shit man should use gender-neutral language.
That sure is a typo.
Did you know emoji are actually incredibly useful if you just want to make a quick thing in a website.
You no longer need to go fuck an icon and upload and manage a image for it.
Just shove an emoji in there.
It'll even fit whatever font the user is using.
Didn't know about that untill now.
Its pretty slick I use it at work.
Well i still like my emoji solution.
MoonWolf no new quests x.
2 minutes to late.
Welp Adventure Time Lego confirmed.
MairBear you going to be watching the announcement in 20 minutes.
Also i'm in ze mumble.
<- not sure what Xings deal is exactly but he's got some stuff going on.
<- someone turned the only good bit of SPORE into a good game.
I'd link the actual site but it looks like the imgur attention killed it.
Let's see how quickly the community burns down.
Also this is infinitely too scripted.
Oh okay she's actually good.
ChaosSmurf oh you get to see the fact they managed to find an actual woman thats actually here to talk about HS.
Instead of just host.
I am so close to death with this flu right now.
Time to talk on mumble or too busy/congested ?
Oh man frodan ditched the pink jacket.
Just a purple shirt now.
And then the server went down.
Not hard enough eh Brode.
Imagine having to be the other guy on a presentation panel with Brode.
And being as boring as this man.
Which that fucking locus of charisma is next to you.
This guy has been on a few podcasts.
Just you know not brode.
Brode is a bit of an overpowered presence for most people.
They're realyl going all in this gimmick.
Ben Brode cosplay is what I'm all about.
They forgot to change the windows.
ChaosSmurf|Mibbit validated doomsayer is a pretty good card.
Yeah that card might be good.
Especially since he's immune to follow the rules and stuff.
Untill you get a swing off.
I doubt BGH will be teh same by the time this card is legal.
Poeple keep saying that.
But i think BGH is here to stay.
Ahahahaha it is actually gonna be a massive wait.
Why won't you let me pre-purchase with gold blizzard.
The wait from announce to release is like as long as the gap between Magic sets.
Do i dare look at reddit.
For what reynad is about to say.
He's gearing up for some trollin'.
THEY'VE BOUGHT YOU OUT.
Reddit has not broken out in anger yet.
I am so dead.
Are these two the two they hired from the competition.
Wooooooow she is good.
Becaues i wasn't actually listening to the fucking preambles.
She's smooth as fuck.
Both of them are pretty great tbh.
How the fuck was oldgods.com not taken.
Tey might just have bought it.
I assume somebody was just sitting on it yeah.
The site is down obv.
Has reddit imploded yet.
Noelor brb but on the way.
Wikihow now embeds animations.
I may or may not have now ruined pokemon.
The perfect censor goldleaves.
So while I'll probably won't ever play Division but my god I am fucking loving the soundtrack for it O.
Eldritch horror was pretty fun.
I think I almost liked it more than arkham horror.
MoonWolf She is classified neither as a Servant or a Master and her existence causes the air to continuously warp like a human moan.
Burn in Hades.
I like how many of these are just Mega evolve.
MoonWolf She is classified neither as a Servant or a Master and her existence causes the air to continuously warp like a human moan <- great.
Looks like there might be a WC3 patch next week according to rumors.
Successfully caught Houtengageki the Axew.
He has Dragon Rage which is still pulling weight at this stage of the game.
Noelor i didn't know dragon rage ever got bad.
Dragon Rage always inflicts exactly 40 damage.
Part of the parade of gen 1 misinformation in the days before datamining that was not just prima strategy guides.
Dragon rage is a dragon type move therefore you should bring it for vs lance who has dragons and dragon moves are super effective.
<- lifecycle of a waifu.
So DS2 has random NPC lines. Problem is of course that these lines might happen when there are mobs around which interrupts them.
So one thing I don't like about DS2 aside from the death system is that mobs respawn far too frequently.
How quicly is that ?
No idea about timescale but it does also happen if you reenter a zone via teleport.
Although at one point I was in a cavern and was pulling away from a mob that I had pretty much just then started fighting only to discover respawns behind me.
Yeah thats too fast.
Thankfully its only one or two weaker ones mostly.
Mostly an annoyance though. But I guess the annoyance increases with that you respawn on death back in the central hub town of the chapter without any of your gear.
I was a bit hang on here / when I discovered that thankfully you can just tell a guy give me my stuff back and keep the gold that was lost but then again you run the risk of loosing a bunch of gold.
Also you always load in at the hub teleport which can be annoying as well since you have to slog through stuff all over again unless you have a close by teleporter activated.
Just win 10 update and stuff ?
Haha fuck you DS2 got partywiped when the minor boss mob had like 5 health left v.
Thankfully retrieving gear can be done at range.
MairBear new card revealed on streama while ago.
A terrible muster for battle variant.
I have no words.
But here have this short film about suicide.
Got to have some katana sheathing mounts.
When the Street Sam gets a car.
<- Dawn with 4 differnt Command merits wants to rule the 100 kingdoms.
Good news brits apparantly the cookie shortage has been resolved.
<- I'm almost tempted to use that.
Since my players will be back in hundred kingdoms in a session or two and they recently lost their army and half the land.
Well sure why not.
Well I say half the land Half the land they owned which was just a small part of hundred kingdoms.
Bah. Couldn't find my better hair brush and now the air is filled with crackling and the smell of electricity.
MoonWolf and part of the army is ghost samurai D.
Well you can read that two ways.
Its either literally ghost samurai.
Or its just a group of mercanaries who called themselves Ghost Samurai because that sounds cool.
Whichever one you want.
Jesus fucking christ DS2 mimics are nasty.
Also putting a near on mini boss on front of a teleporter is evil |.
Maybe it was secretly made by FROM software ?
I am however glad that devs have learned that corpse runs is not a thing you should do in single player rpgs.
MoonWolf you added My clone.
Inhereted that from existing table i used in Feng Shue.
Makes way more sense in feng shui.
Look sometimes people have clones.
Thats just someting they'll need to learn to live with.
AndrÃ© the Giant was once in a Montreal bar when four drunken men started to taunt him. AndrÃ© finally got fed up and chased the four men out into the parking lot. When the four men got into their car AndrÃ© simply grabbed the car turned it over onto its roof with the four men inside and left.
AndrÃ© the Giant confirmed for lost Primarch.
Time for one more thing for the solar generator.
Demense can get fucked.
Anathema Machop exercise by lifting Graveller a pokémon over 5 times their own weight.
There is no 'I'm genuinely sorry' emote in Hearthstone.
Not at this point no.
I'm sure some of there were intended to be.
Needs the Dark Souls one.
P sure Dark Souls would be I'm sorry... heh heh heh.
Not the one I'm thinking of in this case.
Noelor what are you up too ?
But you keep looking up HS cards ?
I was watching am arena VoD.
There are a whole bunch of dragons available way early in XY.
MoonWolf does bonsai solar do ARPG elite names like 'RAGEGROWL THE UNSPEAKABLE' ?
I want it to make names someone could at least consider using.
MoonWolf seen the hearthstone giant worm revealed in Japan?
MairBear if you can stick that on the board and have the beasts gain immunity for a turn card.
Also why is super hogger worse than normal hogger?
Complete board clear + 8 damage to face.
Anathema if you have something you really want for the solar thing you should say so now.
Otherwise i'm going to start on 13th age character generator tommorow.
Dunno if it's worse.
Less worth its mana sure.
I do like the idea of trying to kill it popping out fresh gnolls if you don't finish in a single blow. As well as some warrior hijinks.
Noelor the problem is that hogger is already not really good enough.
MairBear except at 7 mana 6 health is not un-deal-with-able.
Not fantastic but there's plenty of legendaries to take him over in arena.
Noelor that's why I dislike it it's even more of a lodestone for removal especially non-damage removal.
And he's certainly not insta-dust in your constructed collection.
Whereas if you're burning a fireball on a 4/4...
And basic Hogger always spawns at least one gnoll.
Rather than 0 if silenced.
MairBear play it as warrior and bouncing blades.
Hope you get lucky.
Hope you get lucky <- hearthstone.txt.
Ping one hit hogger. Ping 2 hit gnoll ping 3 hit gnoll.
MairBear you need to believe in the heart of the cards.
Someone call an Inquisitor we need some Exterminatus.
That software was not meant to be used on video.
Why does it turn into a van at the end o.o.
So in todays game my players got down from the mountain finally met with little boo after 5 days of holding banquets outside the gate and completely failed to meet big boo.
Or rather great boo.
Little boo being the chieftain of a small village great boo being a former king who was almost devoured by a god or who devoured a god depending on who you ask.
Anyhow great boo now is now a being who holds some kind of undead court at the bottom of a lake. That my players managed to escape from by first building a really sturdy raft and then stunting well.
They built a raft.
At the bottom of a lake ?
No they just traveled the lake/river via raft.
Even after being told the water was cursed.
A rafts true purpose is to float therefore if you build a raft underwater it will float upwards to the surface.
Cooked_Auto but a raft is made out of floating materials.
So if you want to build a raft udnerater.
You must first get the material.
From not at the bottom.
No you see build a raft for any material it will inherit the desire to to float and will therefore go upwards if it were to be built underwater.
Because it is in fact a raft.
Well all you really have to do is to get a buch of giant balloons.
That you then smuggle underwater.
But that wouldnt be a raft only a pair of balloons.
Remember a couple years ago those buried copies of ET were dug up?
Elementary did an episode based on it.
MairBear Will Arnett is in a new Netflix sitcom called Flaked btw.
Huh will have to check out.
I may get to it this week not sure how much s2 of Better Call Saul there is yet.
New card revealed on stream.
So mad scientist is going away and that card exists.
So unless there is some amazing secret tech coming up.
Well secret paladin was already looking pretty bad with the loss of its early game and avange.
Noelor i fixed my date but not your own ?
A tweet that will please MoonWolf.
I hope they fined him for the pun.
Cooked_Auto did you know the sigmarines have automatic crossbows called boltstormers ?
Eh only thing that would need to change is the name vOv.
Cooked_Auto they are also strangly boxy looking.
Hey at least they shoot four bolts instead of like one v.
She's pretty weird Weird enough to take two lives? Well she likes cats so yeah.
Noelor I'm using three periods in this message instead of looking up the ellipsis character because I'm lazy how mad are you!?
Anathema not at all.
Just confused as to what software you're in.
MoonWolf interested in an Aldanar's Vanity?
I cleared up to the Warden overnight.
I also finally built a gunslinger talisman.
Switching to guns ?
Noelor was adding translation strings for some UI messages.
MoonWolf no this is for a second character.
Well i'll shower you with guns anyway.
I've already started showering myself with guns a while ago but thanks =P.
You might not have some of these.
Anathema will be happy Bonsai now has a loading spinner and everything.
Now you need to add name generation for the artefact weapons p.
Would you like me to also pre-generate the evocations ?
You just need an thing for basic artefact names.
I'll give it a shot tomorrow.
Mrgrgr of course there arent any DS2 mods.
Wait up to the warden? Sounds like I have some serious catching up to do.
The latest release of the evga overclocking tool on Steam has achievements...
So I bought a new mousemat today v.
Poeple still have those ?
I prefer it than going straight on the table because my desk is kind of worn and textured.
Possibly better than the pie chart.
I've just got a coffee stained adventure mouse mat.
Noelor murdered the warden.
It typed it right it turned out to be the flip side of another card.
Mairnai my deckslots are patching in!
Also it instantly filled those slots back up with basic decks.
One good thing though.
You can go straight from the play menu to the collection manager.
Handlock is a deck recipy.
Lol classic hunter has RAGNAROS in it.
He's a fair legendary.
That doesn't fit in hunter.
Rag fits into any deck.
And will burn you to a cinder if you suggest otherwise.
I don't think thats conductive to a healthy discussion.
Noelor can i offer you some guns ?
Mairnai they made another one of those artwork advertisments.
Another in berlin.
I want this Liadrin promotion I think xD.
Well you play wow.
So you probably can.
So I find it interesting that DS2 offers a bunch of powers that you can use but at the same time kind of gate them behind minutes long cooldowns /.
CookedAuto not allowed to have too much fun.
That is pretty much the reason really.
Poor Gardevoir -.
I think seeing the results is its own punishiment.
No need for the internet shame picture.
Walky is so men.
Man DS2 casters have the worst mana regen I've seen it bottoms out constantly even with weak spells.
In Grim Dawn I basically never spend mana on either of my characters.
Well you've not made any casters.
Nina was briefly a caster.
And still never ran out.
Jielanka is theoretically always casting spells.
But only level 19.
Also all of a sudden my healer stopped autocasting which was weird and I hope that was just a weird bug and not a button I accidentally hit.
It's also annoying that they've decided to gate party size behind a purchaseable expansion. So it goes from 1.5k gold for the fourth 4 and then 5th is 10k gold.
And then 65k for the last one v.
And both are alos hidden behind higher difficulty levels too.
Yeah. But that can be modded of course but that doesnt change the cost for it.
So the game has three difficulity levels base one is Merc which goes from the starting level to some cap and then the other two start from the beginning of the previous level cap and move up in scale.
You obviously unlock these after you finish the campaign in the previos difficulty but at the same time I have a hard time imagining replaying this game even with the chance of a bigger party and harder bosses because the game is annoying as it is.
When did your underscore die?
Havent been arsed to change it.
Yellow nail varnish is real streaky yo.
Well I finally started watching and finished demon echonomics.
I enjoyed it. Even if the ending didn't even feel like a cliffhanger more like a midseason point.
Shame we'll never see another season.
Pretty sure you're better off reading one of the mangas.
I'm taking too much amusement from how annoyed our groggiest nard is tonight in exalted.
Why are you annoying your grognards noelor.
Because it's really easy.
And I got super fed up of his shit earlier this evening.
Anyway this is what I achieved during tonight's exalted 2e game.
Noelor>> I am really quite intrigued by this 'grognard' and would like to learn more.
I agree with Dob it sounds amusing.
Also I've probably been there in the I got nothing out of this rpg session but didn't end up in the nail painting dept.
Probably more the 'breeding 5iv dudes in xy' dept.
Well looks like i'm installing wow again.
Need to level a class to 20 to get the HS paladin.
Well okay then that should take 10 mins.
Will do that when I wake I spose o.
Last night in WHFRP we finally got a lobotomy done on the Bretonian noble because he had started wearing mud to keep the Beastmen away and chasing away animals because they were spying on him.
And the Dwarf who is possessed by a Khemrian pharoah escaped and when we found him later he had a mercenary attack us almost killing the halfling. He escaped by falling out a window and by the time I did first aid for the halfing and the mercenary we are in Karak-a-Karaz I do /not/ want to get arrested disposing of bodies is hard he had vanished.
The noble will soon have a robot hand to replace the one we cut off a while ago so he didn't get possessed by a demon.
You... lobotomized a guy and cut off his arm.
And somehow he doesn't hate your guts ?
Oh no he's mad at us.
It wa for his own good.
I like how my melee fighter can knock himself out by taking too much damage from increasing his attack speed I have no idea what the fuck is going with that skill.
Which seemed to be a mod thing. Okay strange thing to add.
MairBear got my liandrin earlier today.
Was pretty easy because of the changes blizzard made to how heirlooms work.
No need to mail them anymore meant i could just load up a warloc in heirloom shadowmantle and headmasters charge.
And murder everything casually by just casting dots while walking around.
MoonWolf see I think I have a level 19 somewhere.
Thats all you need.
Its tied to the achievement.
So just proc that and your good.
My first wow character ever is still only 19.
Also that undead Vos lady.
Fucking OP as shit taking all my credit.
This guy of mine level 19 still walking round in greys and whites he has greens but only one or two of them are level relevant.
Suits has 5 seasons?
MoonWolf there we go and handing in that quest tripled my monetary total.
Anathema its one of my favourite PMJ covers.
Anathema Bonsai now generates names for artifact weapons.
Still need to do armor.
Artifact Light Weapon - Final Sun Feather Bringer of Law.
You found a non terrible wikihow article.
A rare thing indeed.
How to Do The Thing.
1. Do The Thing it's not that hard don't know why you're coming for a guide.
I dunno doing pro wrestling moves seems kind of hard.
From a friend on skype who studies game design in Canada Today we got an explanation of why the WoD MMO got shut down. Blame Dust 514.
Could be seen as a roundabout confirmation of why it happened.
TIL I missed PMJ being in Newcastle incidentally.
Mmmmm yeh drawing a blank at that one.
You were in the channel though.
Ahahaha oh wow.
<- i'm going to have to play this.
Would that full list gave blood-elf mini-dins.
Blizzard really needs to have generic token cosmetics.
So you can have different imps/recruits/treants.
MoonWolf MoonWolf MoonWolf.
That would just confuse players.
I'm suprised players are not confused by the fucking cards.
So many of these now.
In before all of the pictured things get axed in testing.
That would be a shame.
What are you \o/ ing ?
This is incredibly dumb.
And now Bonsai also has armor names.
So you can find Medium Armor - Star Deflector or Heavy Armor - Black Moon Sheath Chargebreaker.
One problem i forgot shields were not technically a thing in the book.
So it like smaking shields.
'unknown Hard Error' thanks VS.
Thank god its not one of those wily Soft Errors though.
Yeah I'm not the biggest fan of the new background changes for Warcraft /.
Oh they finally lorified spirit keeprs.
Makes you wonder if they'll ever update the models.
Don't really need to.
But they should updated some of the ones around the undead areas.
TIL that any NPC of note in Darkshire apparently turned out to be Legion worshipper. Which feels really fucking cheap.
But the lore has always been cheap.
Yeah but that feels extra cheap because it sorta undermine the entire place.
It sort of removes the whole aspect of it being a point of light and resistance in a place that the kingdom forgot and now it just Nah it was evil too.
GW apparently revising their policy on having a social media presence.
Finally finished 999 for the first time.
Now time for all the other endings I guess.
...Well not now. But later on.
Game is still on for tonight right moonwolf?
I'm not I count Bethesda in the people who know what they're doing category.
They're the people who could really do with adopting a proper game engine but for some reason they stick with the one they cobbled together out of bits of the Gamebryo engine like an enthusiastic child making a robot out of toilet paper tubes.
I have read something as strange as a Warhammer book with a happy ending.
Old WHFB fiction was weird P.
Anathema his english accent is ON POINT.
So in one of the stories in the Vampire Genevieve omnibus she finds herself inside a temple of Morr where this amazing line shows up She had never seen a place so desperately in need of the cheery touch of an elf interior designer with a passion for bright orange and turquoise cushions and sweet little paintings of happy kittens and fat babies.
That same story also manages to work in a Snow White reference in a brilliant fashion.
MoonWolf oh I did subtitles without audio because I'm at work.
CookedAuto my verisimilitude is slain.
Lemme type out the description of the temple.
What vampires can't enjoy bright colours ?
No its more that the followers of Morr needed it.
I doubt the Empire has pictures of happy kittens or fat babies as a cultural thing.
Or even iterior designer as a title.
Anathema thats why they need to bring in the elf.
All around were reminders of the grave she had never found time to lie in wreaths of black flowers refectory tables shaped like tombs marble urn soup tureens chairs with gravestone backs and seats mausoleum dormitories with cots like coffins skullfaced-doorknobs ossuary skirting boards.
CookedAuto>> yeh saw that lost patrol thing on BoLS. No doubt like Space Hulk they'll make 500 copies maximum worldwide.
Not one I'd had experience of before. Well dont think it was quite 2000 when I got the 3rd ed starter set.
I've passed it along to a nid player I know who knows if she'll be overjoyed at the chance of possibly getting new Genestealer sculpts.
They'll be the same exact ones used in deathwatch I bet.
Who knows right now.
!note MairBear Who wants Dr. Shieldmaiden.
Nature is the worst.
Maisie Williams is amazing.
MoonWolf it's play minions get free spells today.
MairBear you mean to say you can play brawl already ?
I cheked on US.
Have this tihng.
You have to enter your password to disable facebook order on the twitter website.
Its a good idea to request password verification when you want to make profile or preference changes on an account that is always logged in.
And doens't enter a password very often.
It just amused me that there was that extra step in the way of switching it back to twitter mode.
Noelor yeah but its just there as a security measure.
For someone who walked up to your pc and figured they'd make a hilarious joke / steal your account.
The worst thing someone could do to me would be to enable twitter's facebook mode =<.
So how about them RPG's noelor?
Finally its good for something.
GlennCuttlefish remember what i said last night about chest runs in grim dawn.
Also they improved ... offensive... devotions.
Fuck know how they balance shit over at Crate.
There are no more reliable spawn chests.
Dynamite chests.
Haven't been able to test anything yet but I hear my build is even worse now.
Crate just hates you specifically.
Jesus christ how is this patch eating up a gig of space?
Fixed a bug where the third encounter of Izaro would sometimes not have Izaro.
Seems like a rather critical bug.
And thats why the witch is an exile.
Two weeks until more Archer hnnnng.
With their algorithmic bullshit.
Grim dawn still needs a combat log.
I would like to know which one of those normal skeletons just oneshot me.
Lets just silently turn this option you turned off on again.
Becaues our new feature is SO GREAT.
Oh come on they even nerfed tome of names.
Kind of tempted to just make this into a 2handed build at this point.
Doesn't hurt to try.
I mean I guess this build is still ultimate viable but getting kind of tired of all these nerfs.
Weird I ordered a bunch of brushes from an english store on tuesday. They arrived today.
I expected them next week at best.
That was uprisingly fast.
Apparently a recommended envelope helps.
Even got a thank you note. Feels very British.
On a lark I tried coming up with Warcraft 13th Age Icons. First mistake was using the book ones as a base. Second mistake was probably having the idea v.
Lol 4 thousand dolllars.
Where's that dick ChaosSmurf when you need him.
MoonWolf the forbidden cards.
Last I heard he was sneaking out of a women in games dev panel that's where.
Anathema he's at GDC the ass.
MairBear the damage one is meh.
The summon one though.
Great for dead turns.
Half an hour of overwatch beta verdict this is nuttin like ut2k4 Im goin back to Heroes.
Wish i had overwatch.
You will once open beta hits.
!note MairBear fake shaman card inspired by the other two.
Some Swit is going to get fucked up.
So on the news today a presenter was talking to the Shadow Chancellor about the new budget 'cause its yet again its fucking over disabled people and he said do you not feel that you've failed them disabled people worse than George Osborne by making your party so unelectable.
Do you feel guilty for all this bad policies for not getting elected.
Thats a good question there.
The most galling bit was the suggestion that Labour are *more* responsible than the Tories for the policies the /Tory majority/ government is enacting.
Sick of all this state propoganda.
I assume BBC news?
They're dicking everyone daily.
BwaS ch4 I think this was actually.
Gonna get some yellow tomorrow and try an Imperial Fists scheme.
In case anyone is interested in checking out the first Warcraft background book.
Oh fuck off nature.
It was fine outside today. weather was nice it was dry I was actually able to walk outside without having to curse the cruel bastard gods.
Still seems relatively warm no?
Told ya it would get fixed sooner or later v.
Shame we had like 10C earlier today and clear blue skies.
It was quite nice.
>Drinking in Warcraft makes you see enemies a couple level lower - Haha never realized this was a thing.
Iirc the gap widened with each stage of drunk. Tipsy -1 so on. I was really confused when I first encountered it.
Warm yes but theres snow everywhere now.
!note Noelor So in my class yesterday my teacher said Okey dokey but with her accent it sounded like big heart-bump Dc.
MairBear the did you see the new paladin card ?
MoonWolf is there any word on if your C'thun has X trigger while C'0thun is still in your deck or hand?
It is in fact forbidden healing.
Paladin spell double the healing as mana consumed.
Yeah I googled while I waited and also came across that klaxxi card I'd missed before too.
Hopefully shamans get Forbidden Totems.
Summon mana worth of totems.
MoonWolf forbidden skill - spend mana deal that x 20 damage. Hunter probably.
ChaosSmurf will be mad.
One of the new Witch ascendancy classes has some spectre buffing nodes.
They did not call one of them 'Full Spectre Warrior'.
Well GGG are not blizzard.
Sonova bitch. And there are no other good clients either /.
Guess I'll have to start looking for a new twitter client then. Great.
I just use the website.
Guess I'll have to do the same considering how often I have FF running in the back with 4chan threads open I guess I should do the same with TD.
Although I'll have to run two windows now since I've got two accounts /.
Since I can't run both columns at the same time now. Motherfucks.
I like how it has two regions that are mad max.
Cooked_Auto what version of windows are you on ?
Os Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 Â â€“Â uptime 3w 4d 40m.
Chapter I concludes with a timeline of Dragon Pass in the 3rd Age that includes a lot of tantalizing out of context stuff. Notable passages include War between hill peoples of Dragon Pass and Ducks.
And with that weâ€™ve finally finished Chapter I. Next time weâ€™ll be diving directly into the Character Creation process since this is 1978 and the concept of explaining the base rules of the game before any other content hasnâ€™t been figured out yet. snrk.
There is some marginally okay twitter cleints but they're mostly windows 8/10 apps.
Not normal desktop apps.
Because that would be too handy.
And not get you ad revenue.
Hopefully the death of tweetdeck will inspire someone.
Most people are just too used at using the websites nowadays. Although the timeline changes might correct that somewhat.
Twitter wants to be facebook so bad.
Because twitter Isn't facebook.
And trying to compete with them on those terms.
Is going to fail.
You know what's crazy? I just looked it up and Orcs and Humans was rated E. heh.
!note Noelor your 13th age tweet has retweets by designers but no comments on rules.
Something accidentally going free on a digital storefront - the only time a bug on consoles is fixed in minutes. lol.
Granted that would be really easy to fix though.
One of the people in my WHFRP group sounds almost exactly like Jim Sterling.
Just ask his opinion about rnadom videogames every now and then.
Noelor might be ? i don't know.
The Path of Exile expansion popped up in my Steam Queue.
I think its not even officially announced y et.
Just happens to already be working.
And it took me about a minute to realise it wasn't Pillars of Eternity.
In client she still says unlocks in an upcoming promotion.
Just like I don't remember the GUI being that big this seems very fast.
Or something to that effect.
MoonWolf it's on the b.net client now.
And it doesn't mention a time limit ?
Guess its going to be there for quiiite a while then.
Lucario can summon a bo made of aura now?
What move is that ?
Idk it's the opening shot of.
Afaik there's very little adherence to moves as such in Pokkén.
I just didn't even know that was in Pokkén 'til now.
Also I was on my WiiU literally yesterday wondering when Pokkén was out and discovering that it was not yes.
But it wasn't in coming soon either?
So I guess I hit the store at a very precise time ahead of its release today.
As nice as that is.
Not sure there needs to be eight minutes of it?
I just needed a quick example.
That was the first result.
Ordinary Stream Talon.
Erased with its OP and current status at episode 11 totally teasing me reminding me of another time travel drama show I was big on.
It's probs not gonna fulfil such teases.
Anathema if the xp from tonight's game didn't get you that far gain however much takes you to 50.
Once you've spent your 50th experience point you will be essence 2.
Here is a horse in a suit.
So after 2 nights of testing broforce is awesome.
Any of you got blade and soul accounts?
Figured I'd give it a try today.
Oo ff14 is freeish now for a while.
Might have to reinstall that if blade and soul doesn't work for me.
TIL there is a finnish samurai metal band.
Actually TIL samurai metal is apparently a thing.
Well I was wondering how that took so short of a time to install everything. Apparently last 3 installing screens have just been for the launcher.
Jesus christ this is the slowest download I've seen in a mumorpeger since wow expansions.
Its jumping between 200KB/s and 400KB/s.
Which is not great considering this is a 10 gigabyte download.
So nice I could just walk out the backyard and basecoat instead of doing it in the garage.
Sounds like a plan.
I'll stick with staying inside. Entirely too cold for drawing on the veranda even if I did equip myself with a hot cup of coffee.
!note Noelor have some ditto plushies.
Noelor>> heads up derby tomorrow KO lunchtime town might be a lil feisty.
!note Noelor also fixed the issues with bonsai saving files breaking the Dots for merits.
EDF is the best game.
EDF! EDF! EDF! EDF! EDF! EDF!
That is certainly an ambulance siren.
Good god. I actually got the game up and running before midnight.
Tell us hwo shit it is when you're done.
Hey if I thought it was going to be completely shit I wouldn't be trying it.
Somehow I ended up creating something else than...Female whatever that short race is in this.
Thats just how terrible the short race is ?
Its just that there was something even better for me.
Not really a fan of this loading time.
Also if I wasn't so fond of my cuttlefish avatar I would have used a variation of that character as my steam avatar C_A.
Oh come on one of those tiny creatures is a NPC kung fu master but that wasn't available in character creation <.
No tiny kung fu for you.
First thing I learned was sprinting.
Which allows me to also jump higher.
Second thing I learned was gliding in the air.
Voice acting could be better otherwise this feels like a solid MMORPG.
So far the game does not feel bad at all. I have a counter move.
An actual honest to goodness counter. Its what I have asked for ages.
Just realised in my twitch inbox I received a DLC giveaway code for HotS back in february.
Conveniently one I'd been pondering buying anyway D.
I never knew you felt that way.
None of these are culture names.
Which is a problem.
Got around to making another character in this.
The smallest race has a whole section for ears and tails in chracter creation.
But what about glennshiro.
Dont you mean glennshirwho?
I'm not abandoning that character just trying out different classes.
So I am reading the antagonist section for todays game.
On gorillas it says but those wise engouh to stand resolute against this display can force the ape to back down and find the troop to be peaceful almost accepting after that.
And right on the next page there is a picture of somebody punching a gorilla.
Hey if your a solar you can do that.
If your not you're going to end up dead or at least having a lot of broken body parts.
Tzimisce vs tremere.
TIL HAL is called that because they just subtracted one from each letter in IBM.
What the shit audible.
I no longer have any problem with audiobook piracy.
Your upset about a 3mb update ?
Or the colours ?
Colours the UX the *necessity* of it.
That program is like a decade old.
And by the looks of it.
Noelor as suggested weeks ago and it only does human barbarians for now.
Thats a local link.
Grand Claw Pillar Sadness <- is this a person or a place?
MoonWolf you have Suprise in the tie context list.
Grand Claw Pillar Sadness <- is this a person or a place? person.
The first character I rolled has 9 backgrounds.
Is the ability spread lacking race/class bonus?
Yes it cannot do math.
Then purely from a readability perspective maybe put those bonuses below the spread?
How long's your OUT list?
I always sound like I'm being sarcastic even when I'm not that's not unique.
That's just being british.
This time its magically enforced.
Do the OUTs that mention Icons have the names defined or ?
Names defined because most are too specific to the icon.
So I think the background list only goes to 9 when it's 321111.
I am the one son a hag that wasn't drowned at birth <- *of a hag?
Going to add all of the races and add a whole lot more backgrounds tomorrow.
I did just one race and one class first because its a lot easier to fix/change things on one set that tons of them.
>Area is inhabited by goatmen.
Not sure what thats a map modifier.
The only enemies are goatmen.
There is lots of baying.
Yeah but it doesn't raelly CHANGE anything mechanically.
Its just a wasted mod.
Mod unless this map has horrible monsters does nothing.
Other than unique maps the monsters in a map are random.
Then it could have just randomed goatmen anyway.
Randoming all goatmen would be crazy unlikely.
Its a map mod because it means the monsters are all either spell casters or have a leap attack getting hit by 20 leap attacks at once will /end/ you.
Area has increased monster variety.
Noelor what are you up too in grim dawn ?
I'll just go murder bandits with my summoner.
Lemme know if you feel like stabbing people with ice.
In a flurry of blows.
Already read it i really apreciated the use of the Dictionnaire Infernal illustrations.
Huh did not know they intended to sell expansions that were like 'some new magic items and a random doodad'.
Yeah they had dlc planned before we even knew it exist.
Also they wanted to sell it on cd because uhm.
So that was never going to work.
>online payments in 90s.
So it has to be on cd.
But tiny things like that distributed like full games or expansion ?
Is that an actual name you generated ?
Check my link p.
I cba to think of a name.
But that one's just disturbing.
PoE servers just died.
I died on a boss fight boss died as I did dropped a unique...
You shall never have it.
I had that same feeling as I finished DS1. Was about to grab the loot from the final boss when the game just ended and kicked me back to the main menu v.
Oh yay the servers are back and my map is still alive.
Yay I got it.
Also known as What happens when bored finns have access to tools.
TIL that the way I imagine things is called aphantasia.
I don't have mental images.
Last time I looked into it there weren't that many articles around seems some came out last year that actually put a name to it.
Meanwhile I think so much that I can't remember my dreams.
Dunno if that really is a thing or just my terrible memory.
Oddly enough I have vivid dreams and often remember them.
I know I dream but I can't remember them or describe them.
Last night I dreamt I was a sound technician at a nightwish concert and then at some point it metamorphosed into some asian guys birthday party.
In a way I know they are but its just nothing when I try to describe them.
Actually if I have a full nights sleep I often dont remember them but if I wake up and then go to bed for a hour or two I do.
Yeah I might as well just double wipe them in my case.
Since I go back to bed again after grabbing meds.
Recent one I had I was going to an Arsenal game at the Emirates and found myself in a really weird parking structure seeking out half n half scarves.
But man no mental images that must hurt.
Well I didn't think so until now D.
Mostly it bothers me because I have only really vague memories of my childhood.
To be fair I have that as well or very scattered things.
I also think my love for puns stems from this since it allows me to think in a manner that is conductive to bad puns.
I guess. Meanwhile I spend so much time thinking over things that I'm bad at improvising on the spot.
I'm...Decent at improvising at coming up with plans and such.
But IE my players main complaint so far has been that my descriptions lack detail in exalted.
I think I'm better at just coming up with dumb dialogue and response than I am at planning because for planning I always want to know a lot of details and such.
To be fair my plans are go there do X if that fails wing it.
I am perhaps crippingly reactive to things rather than proactive.
Well thats certainly hipster.
I’m pretty far in Fallout New Vegas and I consider it only having crashed twice so far worthy of celebration fair.
Must not have many mods.
Ashen Lion Dawn Twilight Caste.
Mentored by Pure Sun Fish!
Actually mentored by a talking sun-fish.
Imgurs being shitty for me.
But the ones that did load are great.
I like Dude-A-Pult and THE Dude the best.
HS doesn't really have saccing does it?
Motsly it has targeted offensive abilities that might situationally be usefully used on your own minions.
And those mostly warrior.
The only real sac card i can think of is.
Totally legit that it only shows up in lock.
Maybe we'll see more similar cards in OG.
It tends to be more like.
You can eat your own minion but you'd prefer the opponents.
I know you're beholden to hearthhead's I've forgotten the acronym.
Can you see if set can be added to that output?
I can see if i can.
With standard coming up.
If i can i'm going to see if i can make it like.
Classic Neutral Minion Hungry Crab - 1/2 for 1 - Battlecry Destroy a Murloc and gain +2/+2.
ClassicStandard Neutral Minion Hungry Crab - 1/2 for 1 - Battlecry Destroy a Murloc and gain +2/+2.
Is right next to enter okay.
These are both true facts.
The sun was actually up when I got out of bed this morning.
Daylight savings it reversing soon.
Might not be next week yeah.
Makes getting up hella easier.
Looked it up its this sunday.
It's actually previewed by the windows clock/calendar nowadays.
Not on win 10 i just googled it.
I just have to click on my clock to bring up the calendar view and there's a little footnote.
I have a calender thing.
Win10 is such a step backwards =P.
Not fit for purpose.
I can add addtional clocks to it though.
It's capped at 3 in W8.
Not that I really need a third.
I have a central america time up.
Because people hate announcing streaming stuff in CET.
I just have Japan.
But also just a Good name.
The crescent's southern-facing side is concave just that phrase.
Well it doesn't have to be concave on the south side it might be convex on that side.
If it had been convex on that side.
It wouldn't have been a problem!
Like someone had a meeting.
Yeah it'd have been a problem on the north side then.
Or maybe just an architect sat down.
And presumably the question Hey which way round should my crescent-shaped window-having building be?
And the answer was The crescent's southern-facing side is concave.
Seems reasonable to me.
Unless you're in the southern hemisphere of course.
You can't tell me what to think.
Omg shado-pan Lili might be the first thing HotS gets me to actually pay for.
Better than explorer lili ?
Yesss my weird toe-shoes should be delivered today.
Mogwai have an Undertale song Kids will be skeletons.
MairBear shadow pan lili is pretty adorbs.
Even if thats a horrible weapon.
Why not put the rings at the Back of the blde.
Now they just get in the way of hitting people >_>.
A terrible weapon but she never uses it anyway.
So in Bravely Second there is someone who can control cats who speaks in heavy handed cat-puns and is called by a character a Catmancer I -hope- the original Japanese was just Nekomancer.
Urgh wonder if this is the cause of my memory issues yesterday.
As in I literally ran out of memory last night. I have 16GB...
MoonWolf so apparently mechanical sheep + poison seeds is now a board claer.
Before the sheep exploded before the treants came out but a recent patch reversed the order.
Did they change the ordering on that.
Still a horrible combo.
6 mana twisting nether that does 2 damage to anything spawned by the deathrattles.
I imagine mech sheep also can be useful for board control vs rush types?
Sort of but a good taunt creature is usually better for that.
Tldr we're fucked no matter what.
Anathema go up and down twice per day.
Thats life pretty much fuck no matter what.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish.
4 days free time for lapsed subs.
It's a fair time before the campaign ends so no rush either.
I'll pick that up if I get bored of blade and soul.
How Usain Boat isn't winning I don't know.
Well I know what I'm watching for a while now.
GlennCuttlefish on that subject should i try it out?
MairBear I was not very impressed with BS.
Other than being able to make a character so giant they don't fit in the character select screen.
I'm enjoying it so far.
But I do fear it might grow boring over time depending on how the encounters evolve.
It is mechanically one of the best MMORPG's I have played so far and I love the aesthetics.
I'd say that also depends on how intrusive the F2P limitations are as well.
If you do start playing it MairBear let me know.
So far I haven't noticed any limitations other than 2 character limit.
Eeeh freebie so I will give it a shot.
Are you going to join some americans again another european group or should I find out which server I am on?
MoonWolf new card according to Disguised Toast Warlock 10 mana destroy enemy minions draw for each minion.
The fact thats its enemy minions.
Big play if it works out.
So it's Twisting Nether + draw.
Well its better than twisting nether.
GlennCuttlefish I know no one playing it so I'm planning on stalking.
Also I missed Herald Volasj.
That is also interesting.
Ah crap I know I had an NCSOFT this is gonna be a fun game of guess the password.
Oh right. WildStar xD.
Race resticted classes. X.
ChaosSmurf you liked those WWE game model glitches right? Here's a UFC one.
Huh that's interesting.
Sadly the questions they will be most frequently asked will be dumb ones whose answers will not help gameplay p.
BwaS also self selected so no questions they don't enjoy awnsering.
Well can't be any worse than the blizzcon crowdsourced wow qa panel.
And there are already people policing the comments to answer questions so that we don't waste the designers' time Welp v.
Nee nor nee nor.
Maybe they have realised what a bad state the 40k rules are in and how it is harming the willingness of people to buy their models.
A man can dream.
Sadly a man is going to have to continue dreaming.
Becuase GW is run by idiots.
No OG cards yet then?
Noelor something about the return it gave broke PS.
Its probably on hearthead.
I'l fix it tomorrow.
Anathema> a sort of I have N to allocate to GW lifestyle their HH books keep nicking off with it.
C why does every army need the 3ft tall colossal unit to operate <- because they are cool and expensive ?
MoonWolf *head might have changed how their search works.
BwaS do you know somewhere that lists the actually pretty good / main plot HH novels?
Someting about that card or maybe the new sets.
Go to HH search for thun.
It returns decks with also a tab for cards.
And then also... all WoW results.
Dob I managed to collect enough stuff to build a 750ish SM army without giving GW a nickle =p.
I think somehow C'thun is being counted across all of -Head.
So its getting tons of stuff that are Not Cards.
Some are pretty accepted good like Fulgrim Legion then trash ones like Descent of Angels.
And ps does not like it.
Noelor Not even indirectly actually. I just asked around friends bought some bitz from stores and hand some spare stuff that just needs repainting.
Dob Battle for the abyyyyysssss.
Should be fixable though.
Cooked_Auto> you mean good or trash?
Specificly the json deserializer.
MoonWolf it's your spider.
Exalted got cancelled tonight.
Its also spamming joins/quits.
I might just switch PS over to a proper HS api.
Because i know one exists now.
Instead of using heartheads website.
Proper as in official?
Proper as in actually a webapi i can use.
Oh. My. God.'.
Noelor turns out Names are the biggest bottleneck on 13th age races.
Takes a while to either source or come up with good naming schemes for stuff like Dwarves or Half-Orcs.
Or three races of elves.
Incidentally half-orcs and dwarves are now working.
Pure coincidence but i just made Normal the half orc barbarian.
Thats... not by designed.
It just combined Nor with mal.
Flicking through facebook groups.
One includes a couple who have literally the same profile photo.
Not oh they're both in each other's profile photos that's cute if predictable.
Taking two pictures is a lot of effort Noelor.
Noelor> 2 from our yr who were going out shortly after leaving school did that.
My profile pic is still Tracer's face-silhouette-icon on the trans flag so w/e.
They were insufferable to have both friended.
I don't think I'm friends on facebook with either of these people!
I just sometimes RP with one of them.
Do you wanna see Dawn of Justice btw?
Not that I'm *that* keen but I can foresee having to talk about it on saturday.
Not sure think sister's up friday so going places like grandma's may be happening.
I'd've thought that was a bigger deal on the other side of the family though?
Not rly easter mandated just the fact she's daan saath and doesn't see everyone so often.
She is off to svalbard of all places so just a swift wknd turnaround in NCL for her.
Okay tilted now. Caller on this podcast making active reference to practices at clothing retailer CA... who have been defunct in the UK market for FIFTEEN YEARS.
Write an angry letter.
BwaS maybe they're dutch we still have CA.
First OW animated short is out.
Time for some deep overwatch lore.
As of yet still un-metzened.
He doesn't sound too dutch he's also a liverpool fan.
Although TIL where a number of their assets went when they flopped... Primarch D.
If you get the feeling of being watched in darkness when nobody is around Haunter is there.
>Winston watching Hearthstone streams.
Noelor in the future hearthstone looks exactly the same.
Seemed to be from the hearthstone segment the shaman played an elemental minion but then when it reverts in a later shot the board hasnt progressed and its back to the totem.
Might need to rewatch.
BwaS the ai is looping the last play because he's watching an article!
Well no wonder my room has been a bit chilly in the mornings.
That bot is telling lies. its -9.
My phone say +4.
GlennCuttlefish what was your server thing?
Err lemme check quick MairBear.
I love how you can make the pupils full on Tsundere simulator intensity.
I still have to figure out what I want to do with my secondary character.
My biggest complaint with this game so far? Loading times.
If I had more slots I'd make a shrivelled up wisened smiling old lady type.
Seems I'm on angler's watch.
Actually if you check the f10 store you can get a free character slot.
Not sure how long that offer lasts end of this month I think?
Huh that's where I made my let's see what this game is like character. Handy.
Still time to make the thing I think I actually want to play.
What did you make first?
Bah of course my name is taken already >C.
Just going with Aellan again then >C.
Ah MairBear good timing to start SH.
I have a observe daily.
Be my hero mairbear.
Get me ze cards.
Mair did you get up 4hours ago or should I expect you to be in bed when I return in about 2 hours?
I'll be up for a while.
Right. I'll try doing the tutorial zone before I Leave then.
GlennCuttlefish done with tutorialplace o.
GlennCuttlefish I also forgot to ask should I be waiting for you or just getting on with it?
Bumble is finally out on Android but my tablet is too old to run it even though it has Android 5.1.
A dating app from the lady who founded tinder but then got harassed and forced out of the company.
Anathema no windows phone app?
Anathema -D I said a funny.
Anathema the tabletop rpg market is a SHITHOLE.
Mair did you get on with it or..?
That's my favourite phrase today.
Ftrbzzs what's the weather like?
Anathema it was a bit cool this morning..
Just logging in for a quick blast of cynicism.
Can't wait to see all the German flags on Facebook this afternoon from people who don't know countries.
Although i live in a country with a flag thats just the french colours rotated 90 degrees.
Minister >exalted on a bank holiday.
MoonWolf is the latest PatternSpider sources on github?
Talk aobut latest sources.
Maybe push nishkriya ?
Considering PoE plugins >_>.
Well you know how to mak those now.
But to do what ?
Couple of things item stats from name plus maybe a price-range algo.
I can't remember the order for any of the stripey tricolour flags without checking.
Dutch is red white blue top to bottom.
French is blue white red left to right.
Also a slightly different red technically.
Anathema you saying you don't want to?
But thats hard to pinpoint propely without having it side by side.
MoonWolf you could call that blue white red bottom to top =P.
Minister yeah but over here in the west we don't use that order very much do we.
Minister I'm just surprised there was no query if everyone can make it! I *probably* can but my Friday morning plans may overrun very unlikely.
Also technically our red white and blue is older than the french one.
MoonWolf do you actually want the latest nishkriya for something?
Just i know you've got at least to updates.
That are not on github.
Anathema MairBear is the only one I'd consider asking.
MoonWolf would have told me by now.
You and Janos are both strident atheists and his family are muslim.
Last week my knee hurt now its OK but my shoulder is quit sore. I just can't win.
MairBear fan improved version of DOOM!
Anathema s'what you get.
When developing a horror game care must be taken when it comes to jump scare triggers.
That stopped being creepy real fast.
Here's the entire thing the previous one is part 4.
A real youtube channel.
Holy fuck this is the best channel.
I knew glenn would like it.
Grmbl I have SFV music stuck in my head and I dont even play it.
Oh hey it's fate/collide.
Thats a good change.
Wish blizzard had one of those.
You should see the first tab on my non seasonal stash.
Its just crafting stuff.
Oh good it also does scrolls.
Do you get on efor free or do you need to buy one to have one at all ?
F2P game so buy one.
Probably worth it though.
Fuck managing that stuff.
$7.50 seems a bit steep though ?
GlennCuttlefish 4 hour maintenance in 30 mins C.
Oh btw MairBear GlennCuttlefish i have put a 13th age book on dropbox thats got a ton of additional Spell Stuff.
MairBear so I woke up just in time for maintentance to start. Good timing.
Now you can look at all those new wizards spells on dropbox.
Sweet they alraedy have it.
GlennCuttlefish I went back to town to learn a profession in the last 10 mins.
Nope have a cutscene and quests.
MairBear I got my outfit.
MoonWolf that thing is bonkers.
Fixed an issue that caused Urshi to always introduce herself to players.
Thank you diablo team.
MoonWolf what's an Urshi? Is it a fish??
A rare fish that steals gems from legendary people?
This book makes me want to play a swordcerer even more.
I think technically a melee-wizard is an easier aproach with tihs ?
I've been doing a 16h fast thing no food after 8pm no food before 12pm forgot today is fish'n'chips paid for by work day but at 1 D.
So break it the one time.
What and have food an hour and a half before a free lunch!?
I meant the fasting thing.
I thought that was obvious from using the word break.
Upgrade with a 1/1 body.
Combo it with upgrade you've now got... a shaman axe.
Don't combo this with upgrade.
He's a got pirate activator.
But you probably want to get a better weapon before you finish the charges.
<- how had i not seen this yet.
But yeah a 2/4 weapon seems like a bad idea.
MoonWolf it's his best yet.
The posing is great.
Also how he has that many recorded variants.
Stupid body I had breakfast at human times.
And had to already get lunch cos dying inside.
HotS seems likea good idea actually.
Abathur for when you can't choose who to play so you'll push between borrowing the other heroes on your team.
I just had fish'n'chips for breakfast it was amazing.
Abathur for when you can't choose who to play so you just yplay your team.
Notch RT'd a tweet by a guy I used to work with -> thread argues about MRAs and sexism.
MoonWolf last week was free Li-ming week.
Playing abathur 2 li-mings on the team every ulti cooldown.
MoonWolf just watching Savjz gets mysterious challengered attacks triggers all the secrets but comp. spirit of course. Mech-sheep poison seeds to clear up and totally null the paladin's turn 5.
Shame that combo only happened the patch before sheep gets remove.
MoonWolf I've looked at Reddit.
As in any card that makes it into wild practically may as well not exist.
Nobody will play wild.
There will not be wild tournaments.
Wild cards are dead.
In fact i'm going to change PatternSpider.
So that it says dead.
It'll just be GvG RiP.
Well other than Arena.
Co-worker peer pressured me into going to an Easter fayre that's on site.
I am v disappointed in said bbq.
It was not worth Â£5.
That has to be pretty bad bbq.
Is it a vegan bbq?
Nor worth breaking my 9 day streak of no meat.
By bbq bbq'd meat in a bun.
Minister has that 9-day streak beeb mostly filled with Bertrand?
Minister i have added to the dropbox a 13th age magic spells book compatible with basically all classes through a talent for non wizards and a bestiary you might enjoy.
GlennCuttlefish bear juggle simulator is back on.
Ball python's defy everything I think about snakes.
Other than the basic shape and armlessness.
I'm ready to bearlift when you are mair.
...except there is an update.
Hehe boss fight gauntlet event one after another waves. But the boss comes down at the end... and can be grabbed.
Killed it before the grab ended.
I'll hop on in a minute filling the fridge while that downloads.
Which will apparently take a while with this horrid downloader.
Fuuuuuuuuuck now the TD client is reminding me it'll stop working on the 15th. And I wonder for how long the website will let me track both my accounts.
CA has a 2nd acc eh.
But yeh that TD change sucks about as bad as when they dropped various bits of YellowDeck like the mobile app.
Anyone here know someone who goes by 'Guldan' on Steam?
If its a friends request just look at the Also knows tab.
Is he offering you a new destiny at the price of a sip of mountain dew?
Ofc it has blue/white stripes.
!note SunTiger Don't forget cards.
Don't forget the heartof the cards.
Well thats lupin the third watched.
The villain was a bit silly but everything else was great.
And even the villain wasn't that bad.
GlennCuttlefish sure in a min or two o.
MoonWolf I have spectate daily if you get time and will to HS xD.
Going to finish killing these monsters in grim dawn.
MairBear no hurries it takes me 4-10 minutes to start up the game anyway.
MairBear i had to try.
It was a good play imho.
Wouldn't have taken so long if i had not run into controll warriors.
MairBear did you farm for your weapon yet?
Or i guess he was a weird control otk one.
Not een on bear juggles since last night.
Want to do it solo or do it now while I am in a suitable morning coma?
I'm happy either way if you want to come or specifically don't want to.
I'm fine with either way. I guess I need to farm some soul shields since enemies are starting to hurt.
Get to the instance when you are available mair.
Also mumble MairBear ?
Sorry for taking so long just a bit more then I'll get my butt on both.
Sorry MairBear something came up feel free to continue solo if you wish.
Just let me know where you got to.
Oh I had homework to do.
Probably won't be back onto BS today at all.
Gifs firefoxs mortal enemy by now.
I may or may not have spent a bit too much time on this v.
You guys are so all in on this.
Something tells me he is not enjoying that game.
Wtf game is this ?
Some Harry Potter game it looks like.
Named Book of Potions.
Oh right last night.
Toonami making two more seasons of FLCL with Production I.G. Not sure what to think about this /.
'ere we go! 'ere we go! 'ere we go!
RAM THEM UNTIL THEY GIVE UP.
Wot u mean dere's a fird acksis of spehs travel?
Not the sun today apparantly.
That took a while.
MairBear have you seen the new card by i think the same artist as tinyfin yet ?
!hs Brood of N'Zoth.
MoonWolf just whomped a Kel'thuzadf.
Renounce seems very silly and inconsistent.
Its one of those look at this amazing highlight.
Oh my god xD Brood 3.
Looks like N'Zoths gimmick is deathrattle.
Top comment on boogeymonster I found the only Legendary I'm going to open.
Yeah i don't think this legendary will ever be good.
Maybe in arena ?
<- pretty much that.
For when you've got the Win 3 games as a warlock daily and really don't want to play warlock.
Also yeah everyone wanting the deck randomiser back should be happy now.
Deck randomizer people are so weird.
I'm sure there is a tool out there.
MairBear I'm going to play some bear fondling will you join me or will I spend the day doing that dungeon for my axeteer?
GlennCuttlefish will be therer soon o.
Is this actual soon or yesterday soon?
Because if its yesterday soon I'll just run the dungeon once anyway P.
Or I will if the game boots up in time.
MoonWolf That's some never lucky right there on my opponent.
GlennCuttlefish washing grabbing tea and then will be on.
So I'd say go for a dungeon once.
But I'll be on before it's done.
Crash #1 off to a good start.
It showed the relevant info.
He got 2 rivendares from his hero power when he was way behind.
Attempt 2 Disconnected from server and it quits.
Computer scientist explaing how to solve computationally Go and illustrating it we're going to need more paper and a significantly larger universe to put that paper in.
Moving computers due to room renovation bbl.
Noelor so overwatch has weekly brawls now and the current one switches your class when you die. this uhm. led to some bugs with the end of game posing.
That Zarya one is real weird.
Given that is actually one of her victory poses.
That ... is weird.
Its scaling her like one of the really big ones.
Her weapon is sticking on her wrist where his shield projector is.
God damn video games with their difficulty.
Playing Armello trying to win a specific way nearly did it that time but the AI suicided on the King. However they killed the king in the process meaning it was a generic high-score victory.
I still won but I didn't get the rewards for winning how I was trying to win.
Those are geese. Yep.
Is that a returnethed glenn then? o.
Yes yes it is Mair.
I have returned from feasting on fish and rubbing basset hounds.
Went into town to buy a board game since I'm going a friend's house tomorrow.
MairBear up for some more bear handling?
This looks pretty good.
>FLGS is closed <- did you forget its happy jesus got nailed to a cross day ?
Mine was open today.
Which was nice probably by tomorrow when the floor changing starts for real.
One of the related videos there has a picture of Zero Samus that is 100% the sfw version of porn.
Which caused a double take.
Don't you give me that you.
MoonWolf GW was open |.
Only because they're never open mondays tuesdays and need to make up for lost gargant sales.
GlennCuttlefish is this you?
GlennCuttlefish need to do this exalted thing D.
I also only spent 2 motes last action O.
Noelor I might get incomprehsible in about an hour been up since 5.
What... SSBM was made from scratch in *13* months...
Finally managed to beat naxx wing 1 on hearthstone.
Threw maexxna into my hunter deck won v rogue in pvp now feel dirty.
All the cards you just won will become illegal in a matter of months!
Got no gold to buy the rest though or the gg expansion fucking off as well S.
Remembered why I stopped playing though 2 of the 3 daily quests the optimal path was win with rogue.
Which was a level 1 brick wall.
The person who did this needs to go to prison.
Wait Psychadelic Eyeball is doing an Lemmings LP? Oh this I will have to check out.
MairBear remind me to give all these roulette tokens to you later.
GlennCuttlefish Mair's character has supernal melee.
And all the flurry charms.
And it's getting silly.
We've gone past silly.
Glenn i think it's no exxageration to say my last turn was ~20 mins in length.
MairBear I think we both can agree that it could be longer.
GlennCuttlefish if I did it right it could have been.
Could have done a second Iron Whirlwind in there.
GlennCuttlefish hey i killed an abyssal on my own with my familiars.
And then stole the kill on another.
MoonWolf may be more drama soooon.
GlennCuttlefish Exalted finished btw.
Sonova bitch token tool has stopped working.
Looks like a java update broke the function to drag and drop images.
And here I needed a token for Star Wars on tuesday /.
Must be a recent issue as I had no problem making a Fantasy craft token a while ago.
Xp grinding the AI to try and get to tavern brawl.
Set up a very lethal status against ai-druid with loadsa board control.
And then I killed myself with fatigue as I still had that 'draw a card' buzzard out.
Oh man how did I miss that Zootopia is out.
I need to see that.
MoonWolf rogue gets mech now.
Because they really needed more cheap spells.
Noelor well not so much they need more.
Justthat cheap spells is part of their class identity.
OTS orcs are now rockabillies.
But they're already rock monsters.
MoonWolf did you ever try using this OTS stuff btw? Cant remember if I linked you it or not at some point.
I sometimes go there if i can't find anything in my current collection that fits.
Some of the disgeae stuff you fought is from there.
GlennCuttlefish going to be in town most of the day by the by.
TIL there was a MGS/MH crossover.
Ok I have 3 of next session's enemies written up.
Hm wonder what more I could add on this list that would fit.
Noelor hurray for being prepared.
Strange DoW Soulstorm refuses to start due to an unknown error.
Yes it tells me its an unknown error whenever I start it up p.
Hm turns out that it downloads mod stuff saved on my profile. Might have something to do that. Pretty sure I can delete cloud saves if anything.
At least reinstallation is quick with 10mb/s downloads.
Glad to know I'm not the only one thinking that.
Nope turns out that wasn't the cause either. So I guess Soulstorm is fucked on Steam.
...REALLY?! It just couldn't install the C++ Redist |.
Grmbl tablet pressure sensitivity gone again.
Time to reboot I guess |.
These are cool.
I also like mysterious challengers secret halo.
<- i assembled them into a mediocre 2 monitor my setup wallpaper.
Concession had to be made and the last stretch isn't great.
You and your three monitors.
Man I'm just too boring to have separate wallpapers.
Sorry for the bmp can't remember where I put the original.
HS opponent sets up massive stack of board control gets halfway through clearing my minions... then concedes presumably due to realising they were just one hero power click from me as lethal.
BwaS what rank are you playing at ?
Well this was on casual but I have rank 24 and a star.
Going by the flock thrown out by that mage though and the backs I think they're a bit in the pay2win category.
90% of cardbacks in this game are/were arnead by simply reaching rank 20 in a season.
Well Zootropolis was def worth a see.
GlennCuttlefish is there bears to juggle?
MairBear sure. Just let me run back to the previous savepoint.
Or not. Died on the way there.
Nothing of value was lost just had been backtracking in search of secrets of which I found none.
Back in my room again.
Only the freshest ingredients.
MoonWolf you think you can confirm my suspicion with token tool being broken due to Java update btw?
Mine is curently working and i don't feel like checking for java updates in case it breaks >.>.
I need it for my TES 13th age game.
Well its only drab and drop thats busted screen capture work but require some finaggling just so you dont have the message visible.
This update is taking FOREVER.
Cooked_Auto drag an drop still works fine.
Because I redownloaded it twice from the site /.
What verison are you on ?
For Java? Lemme find out.
Yeah that's the one I've got as well for token tool.
Token tool i meant.
MairBear remember how blizzard nerfed Starving Buzzard ?
Unleash the hounds into draw 7 beasts is back.
MairBear I have about a hour to 90 minutes to spare while I wake up should we do some light ursine moving?
After this HS i'll leap on.
Except even better by far.
Costs 2 more mana.
Doesn't put something on board.
Still think its pretty powrefull.
Heh also when do hunters need to beat fatigue x3.
MoonWolf so I got 3 Dominance missions in HS.
2 need warrior so I followed a guide for agro warrior.
I -love- beating hunters at the face game.
Stop pickin gon those poor defenseless warriors mairbear.
I had a dream this morning in which I could store my bike inside my phone but it ended up being annoying because the bluetooth kept conking out.
Even dream me has the first worldest of problems.
Imagine if you could though.
Never loose your bike again.
Well untill you loose your phone.
MairBear imagine the following epic hunter play.
Ball of Spiders Infest Feign Death.
6 cards now and 6 cards whenever the spiders finish dying!
And none of them come from your deck.
GlennCuttlefish hopping on for bear swinging.
MoonWolf taking cards from your deck is overrated.
If you want to draw a spell like huters mark.
But can only draw random beats.
This is the trick to english.
We don't like actually speaking our words.
Y'allâ€™dâ€™ve new levels of contraction.
In England we write way more letters than we use.
Like that I'dn't've has easily double the spoken letters.
It's pronounced like Anuv.
I don't feel like it is.
That's how I'd pronounce it.
English The Real Elven.
I slips round to A when it's part of a contraction.
T is basically never pronounced.
I ... do ?
And the d is basically decorative there.
<- i really need to get into the beta and learn to be good at lucio.
I'm terrible at hearthstone and I'm winning the tavern brawl 56 to 1 as KT S.
KT is much much better.
Here have some bugest cost legendaries vs Here have some hilarious and fun minions.
I played an early ish Faerlina the necromancer hero power brought her back like 3 times.
I didn't ever draw Faerlina o.
Had it again like my run yesterday where the other guy played the naga reset legendary I forget the name.
I did however get Blaumeux sp? And hero power brought Zeliek back 3 times in a row and I duplicated him and ressed him twice more.
Y'day was stupid as both had 7/7 on board and I was like I have no time to read all these new minions go face.
Yeah game just now had me with the 2 knights and opponent played a deck duplicator and got the same in their hand.
Ffs Fallout4 just doesn't work anymore.
I am confused by this.
Cooked_Auto its just some anime horseracing.
Whats there to be confused about.
But are they horses? Or girls pretending to be horses? That are also idols.
And let's not forget lesbians.
Well that was a given.
The horses/idols/schoolgirls are also lesbians because of course.
That goes without saying.
Youve got it the wrong way round.
The lesbians are also horses/idols/schoolgirls because of course.
BwaS nah a show based around lesbians first might have meaningfull relanships.
It's not a show but a management game apparently.
Didn't I link that just yesterday.
I know I linked it on twitter a day ago or so as well.
I returned all of the bottles in my room not 6 hours ago.
Again my desk is full of empty beer cans.
I think you may have a problem.
Course there's my windowsill with all these coke empties...
Mine tend to get cleaned out every week.
I drank only half of these in my defense.
S'a pretty cute film.
Have shower -> notice missed call / voicemail from my dad at 717 -> oh shit is someone in the hospital? -> pocket dial |.
Comes with a shield.
Well I felt no urgency to do the FFXIV seasonal thing for easter. TUrns out I should have because if you want any of the actual rewards it's time-consuming and frustrating x.x.
No silly rewards for you.
No spriggan hat chocobo barding tower of eggs for my house. or Pa-Paya song for my music player.
Lol you can get that damn song.
MairBear did you see the Best New Card Ever yet ?
!hs Ragnaros Lightlord.
Wait you could get the song?
WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED.
I'd like to point out at this point that you can now play a deck with three different rags in it.
GlennCuttlefish I only know now C.
You can be rag have a regular rag on the field and also have LIGHTLORD.
MairBear I need a break from trying to perfect this boss will you be farming FF or should we vertically displace some bears?
GlennCuttlefish I have 3 GMT hours and the events are -all- bullshit. And give 1 egg at a time. So no I won't be farming FF it's actively frustrating.
Perfect a boss ?
Bear Juggling sounds better x3.
Playing momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight just found out bosses drop items if you perfect then.
Err hey glenn look over there. It's something to distract you while I do my craft- err. Log in.
Mair no hurries still not even at the pin code check.
Once I get here I'll just go make some coffee and some sandwiches.
Zootopia spawning new furry generations since time immemorial.
Wait not zootopia disney.
Ok this week's Exalted game is actually fully ready.
Unless I decide to add a birb.
The party comes across a bird who is screaming into a cup repeatedly.
There will probably be no birb it would only be there to fuck with Ko.
And I don't think that's necessary?
Noelor i don't even have the essence right now to open like i did in last fight.
Well i do but then i'd be out.
Entirely depends if the birb would have been pepe or a bernie sanders fan.
Actually a phoenix of some sort.
I know Dob doesn't know what a Garda Bird is.
Went up the road to where I thought there was a vegetarian cafe.
I'm good at memory.
And since when were you a veggie?
But anyway I wouldn't really call myself a vegetarian.
I'm just trying it out.
If I get to my birthday and just really want a burger I'll consider it a failed experiment =P.
BwaS paleo's combine some good ideas about food with some ridiculous ideas about food.
They think modern food is like grains are too calory dense and that too much of our food has sugar and salt added that doesn't need it etc.
At that point you're just at whole foods.
And then they go straight off of the deep end that we should instead revert to the diet of our ancient forefathers.
So raw meat? v.
Cooked over a fire.
Rather than black pudding deep-fried.
I dunno from what I remember form Terry Jones stuff the basic Roman food looked pretty okay.
Cant remember if his Egyptian stuff broached that much on the topic of food but I thought the Roman stuff looked pretty okay.
Cooked_Auto if they said hey eat more fruits nuts berries and avoid modern processed foods they'd just have a decent dient on their hands.
Right it's not even classical though.
It's dawn of humanity.
But their Ideas about paleolithic don't make sense.
All that stuff is still modern stuff modified for human consumption over thousands of years.
But yeah just stop at whole foods.
Yeah I dont see the point of going all the way back to Thog and friends for food.
Not to mention some of them combine it with really unhealthy practices for aging meat.
Because thats what they used to do back in the day.
Also and here is a thing.
It gets rid of grains for the most part.
Humanity has co-evolved with our ability to produce grain.
Modern human society requires cereals to function.
Wether thats actually grain rice other similar products.
We can't sustain our population levels without it.
You can have an individual diet without it just fine.
Oh hey had no idea that someone had uploaded this thing in full.
Maybe watch that later.
Hotlinked is to slightly before the food discussion.
I wonder if if my alchemical dies tonight Janos would let me briefly play a Sidereal with Firearms.
Arn't you currently still in the underworld.
Oh yeah Star Wars starts tomorrow for me.
And it was Malfeas not Underworld.
Because if I'd died there I had a Scourge ready.
Whose motivation was to steal the Scarlet Empress from under tED's nose.
Because we the alchemicals ended up rescuing her redness.
A shame you didn't get to play that.
Anyway now we're in Creation helping mountain folk fight a lunar because...
Because we were there basically.
And it seemed a dick move to leave them to it.
And your all about helping the mountain folk because sort they are a little bit related ?
We've helped out this particular group a couple times already now.
And they might let us use their tunnels instead of trekking through the desert which would be nice.
That would be nice.
If your an alchemical anyway.
Personally i'd take the desert.
We have a babby DB with us.
And not all of us have stamina charms for some reason.
I did it i added all the 13th age races. no more fucking about with name generators for a while.
I cheated on the halflings.
Just made them LotR hobbit names.
Is that really a LotR name?
It doesn't seem like one.
A magical explosion turned my right arm invisible well then.
Question why are all these race's names not in the name generator portion?
Nm I found it.
Question why are all these race's names not in the name generator portion? <- they explictly are because i test them that way before shoving them into 13th age races.
The only russian I know is how to call people bad things DotA's taught us so much.
Cursing is the first real thing you learn in any language.
Unless you do so in school.
I know spasiba but that's about it.
Tovarisch? is that russki?
Couldn't tell you what it means.
You don't know blyad or suka ?
Well cyka blyats kind of a given.
This one teaches you plenty of things.
You've probably not watched tihs recently so you should.
Got one in the last wave.
Also that is Deathwing.
We already have Deathwing.
Noelor you must have missed the fact we have 3 ragnarosses now.
Only one of those is actually Ragnaros!
That doesn't look like Nefarian or w/e.
Oh Bobbin Threadbare's Bioshock LP is finished and he's already moving onto his next project LA Noire.
Wonder if it'll be as effective as his hots counterpart.
Bottom right I'm thinking gets the name Stampede.
Its all the hunter animal companions.
I'm hoping its a spell that summons all 3.
How about gives you 3 copies of the spell card in your hand whether you get 1 of each is up to the dice gods.
Nah too many cards to come out of one card.
I wonder if hashtag tracergate has started up anywhere at all.
Wonder if they'll change WM too.
After discussion with Dustin Browder he revealed that the kill-stealing sniper bint from our other new IP is the most hated character in that franchise and had to be nerfed into the ground. We have therefore decided to remove Widowmaker in the interests of the community's sanity.
Blizzard really hates snipers it seems.
Dob we should go out next weekend.
Do I look like a furry.
But yes to 2nd.
Furries are just people.
Well youd think that.
Fixed PatternSpiders problem with moonrunes.
Didn't copy the fucking right dll.
We can all enjoy incromprehensible characters instead of ?'s now.
Was he decoding websites as standard .net strings instead of utf8?
No the ircclient i was using needed an explicit decleration to utf-i.
Well client the client class in the library.
Because why would you assume utf-8 right nobody defaults to that these days.
Well because irc is a garbage protocol and doesn't actually have any notion of encodings.
Except every major server and client now defaults to it.
Also added prefered language headers to the web requests for titles and stuff so ti should now give nice english errors on facebook etc.
1631 but their Ideas about paleolithic don't make sense <--- bread is like 30000 years old.
Keep reading i guess.
I ate bread at the weekend.
Have have failed at a paleo diet.
Pfff I don't do paleo.
Eat healthy food because its healthy.
Not because of ass-backwards reasoning.
66% of my meals are food powders.
I need to cook more food powders don't have enough protein.
Paleo people think you are basically the devil.
You've taken processed food to its extreme.
Its not even food anymore.
My food powders are just nuts and seeds ground up!
Not sure that last one is true.
Its in the fine print I'm sure.
!note Noelor why Karuyo still has no 5s p.
Coidence i assure you.
May need to propose an Ex3 game to my WHFRP group once the book is out... Noelor has given me a taste for it.
Although some people can barely remember the WHFRP rules and we've been playing for over a year now...
Damn some of these are better than I can do in 5* the time.
Man Notch is a dick these days I need to unfollow him.
What a bro.
Uuuuh okay. Sure that's certainly a wish you could make in an ARCHIE comic.
MoonWolf do you use pinned tabs at all?
I have a rss reader addon that lives in a permanently pinned tab.
Sometimes i pin other things.
Can I make them not be tiny squares with treetabs? I couldn't find anything in the treetabs options...
I sort of like it ?
I've got TD pinned now in FF thankfully with the multithread view available still.
Oh another thing if you add this custom style to firefox stylish or manually.
You can double click anywhere on the sidebar for a new tab.
Damn my FF flash was still v19.
Thats... higly out of date.
So my sudden disconnects were because BT were repairing the house phone line it seems. I was preparing to have an internet-less day xP.
I need to get a new GPU my current one is legacy now and wont be getting any more driver updates.
The next Chronicle volume will be about Draenor and the First and Second Wars. oooh.
I've seen some bad mumorpeger launches but tree of savior is one of the worst ones so far.
What are they doing?
Well So far I've encountered quests not progressing monsters not spawning npc's not responding.
Lets see how long until it works.
Sounds like some serious case of servers deying.
Hehe priest player with a complicated minion combo deck.
Plays class card on my 1/4 gorilla that makes attack equal to health turning it 4/4.
I'm guessing they thought it was a card that flips them.
Guy clearly didn't know how inner fire works.
We all have those moments.
Lightning has something against Moogles.
I was disappointed when it didn't turn out to be rules of nature.
Sweet jesus this is some serious machine porn.
Well we finally gave up MairBear how about some bear lifting?
!note Noelor Bonsai now has all default core classes and races. not the optional races yet doing those and 13 true ways next.
Sorry Glenn not feeling it today at least will get back to you if I suddenly want to juggle things though.
^ I am most okay with this.
Like I saw Arse Clarse 1 on the plane in december and it was a flippin riot.
I think you may have gone to ofar this time BwaS.
Woo hearthstone rank 20 ^^.
Aided by my final opponent conceding on turn 0 and being on a bonus star winning streak.
You made it out of the ranks where you can't loose ranks!
I love this artist.
He's not wrong though with the name.
Well nothing to do tonight. Time to start watching.
Someone made an anime out of oglaf dwarves ?
What an absurd series.
But it's new and exciting.
Look at those non broken moonrunes.
I blame f urries.
Sure let's go with that.
Uh is both 13th age books supposed to be gone from the shared folder or what?
Oh my god the SW Campaign even begins with an intro crawl. I'm loving this.
WITH intro music =D.
Nominated for best sci-fi in Japan Star Wars 7 Mad Max Garupan and that recent mahou shoujo Pleiades.
Among a couple others.
In true RPG fashion we start in a cantina.
*Plays spot the PCs thought it's not a challenging session of it*.
So the groups first campaign was a Shadowrun one where one member played a dwarf with a grappledick. Mostly because he could.
It saw some use a couple of times.
Ooooh the GM for this has the whole Fog of War function enabled in roll20. THis is neat.
Suddenly blaster sound effects!
And the FFX LP is finally done.
For once I didn't burn the coffee \o/.
Anathema well done -.
You say that like its unusual.
Anathema has been through some rigorous coffee brewing education under me.
He should be proud of his accomplishments -.
I kept using the boiling water tap in our kitchen here but it isn't boiling.
But also too hot for coffee.
Anathema tell them to get a kettle with a temperature selection.
Coffee didn't fix headache.
While coffee is great for many things fixing headaches is not one of those.
Pleaste Notice. All RMT silver sellers will be banned permanently. With Great Vengeance and Furious Anger.
I like that GM announcement.
Hows tree of savior now that its not day 1 server death anymore ?
Also will get worse once america wakes up.
Unfortunately no proper EU server until some time next month.
Also this chat filter is whack.
Glass cannon is filtered.
Glass or cannon are not.
So ass is not filtered.
BUt ass is.
Maybe they are filtering ass cannon.
But not just ass ?
GlennCuttlefish fyi and postponing tonights game.
On account of my sister might be giving birth today.
Jesus christ this chat filter.
Forgetting my glasses isomewhere I am reminded why I need them in the first place I can't see the text on my 32 inch monitor.
This is sort of cute.
Since all of my plans got cancelled time to restart red read redemption.
Nah not your fault.
Red read redemption? Following the adventures of John Marston the renegade librarian.
Crap battlenet wants me to log in again and who knows where my Authenticator is now.
MairBear somewhere in or near your desk.
Good thing I bought that bottle of whisky today.
Otherwise videogame cowboys would be making me mighty thirsty.
Fallout makes me thirsty for Coke and I can count the number of times I've drunk that in the past two years on one hand.
MairBear give in to your sugary soda desires.
But MoonWolf then I won't have room for all this tea.
There is tea sodas!
That reminds me the one time I accidentally drank cola was when I ordered that Long Island Iced Tea.
Was unaware it was a coke-tail.
Incidentally I also bought Spyfall later that same day.
Coke makes you do craaaazy things.
Spyfall is not crazy.
It is a good game.
Even if I am /really/ bad it.
Hehe big thread on one of my friend's fb posts today posting about new experiences with TW Attila has brought all the armchair generals out of hiding.
The core relationship dynamic in Life is Strange as shown by Japan.
Welp i'm an uncle now.
Sure lets go with that.
MairBear omg this brawl.
Give it to me blizzard.
Welcome to this very dangerous brawl event! Construct a deck with all your best spells but this brawl is too intense for small minions. You may only use minions that cost seven of more!
It has deck building restrictions as in some cards don't even show up to go in your deck.
Totally going to play priest in this.
Or maybe its finally time for astral communion to shine!
This probably won't make sense out of context but I just laughed way too hard at the portmanteau cis-ter.
Noelor you would you damn... i didn't come up with a funny joke.
Also now chaos mage and a thing for high chaos rolls.
I'm just gonna go sit on mumble even if there is no game.
There is no game?
Its in the topic.
I just opened a cider and everything.
MairBear aparantly some new players don't have enough cards in this brawl to Make A Deck.
Hmm can see that.
Anathema new suits on april 1st according to netflix.
Do not follow this advice.
Oh man priest conceding on turn 2 cos I killed his northshire cleric.
Why cant my opponents realise the decks on warlock/warrior/druid are pure garbage auto-generated as I grind the 3 to L10?
Well 29/30 are random the 30th is always ETC.
Because this is low ranks at the end of the season.
These are all either newbies who just don't know.
Actually just on casual not ranked.
Or genuinly terrible at hearthstone.
Hmm no clue then.
But my MMR is tanking from this hilarity.
Well you're playing against terrible people then.
BwaS so you are the actual target audience what do you think about deck recipies ?
If anyone wants to watch me play Overwatch silently in a little bit.
BwaS when you go to make a deck and it has those default deck things.
Could help the existing 'deck helper' doesn't go too deep.
Okay glancing at the tavern brawl the only class I can participate in it with is rogue.
Only got 3 7 minions in my set 4 if you count my lock having malganis.
I 'd challenge you BwaS but i'd destroy you.
Facing a druid who slingshotted himself to 10 mana first turn so yeh.
So 2 episodes into this time travel story where the main character tries to find the assistant but keeps getting sent back in time by fairies and seeing a creepy dog everywhere we finally get told what the dog is.
Tales of the bullshit deck number whatever.
Warlock corruption on a silenced sen'jin shieldy trade with a succ in my favour. Youthful Brewmaster to withdraw the sen'jin.
Granted face was at about 25 to 10 in my favour.
I love these faeries.
Grr wanna slap this episode of qi in the face.
It's the current series yet it's proclaiming Moore's Law is still a thing.
I mean it is.
It's just not true any more.
Dob MoonWolf is BMing me -.
I can see that I just jumped in to spectate as I had that daily q.
I guessed correct it seems.
Doesn't work on non random matches.
But i can you a regular win probably.
Actually it does it seems.
Just got a pack.
That seems wrong but okay.
Another tale of the bullshit deck.
Priest on 2 hp suicided by self-casting hero power with the your hero power heals are dmg minion.
I er hope that's what they planned.
MoonWolf when you wake up and have visitted baby one of the mage recipes is dragon mage.
I can't tell how real it is.
Of course it is.
!note Noelor it could work as a deck i'm not super excited about it.
Sorry no seen command.
I'll just DM him on Twitter regardless I suppose.
Tree of savior exp curve is whack.
That is REALLY WEIRD.
Are those breakpoints where you pick a new/advanced class ?
Err. 15 is not sure about the others.
Also that is the character xp not job xp I think.
In that case it makes even less sense.
!note anathema no exalted finale this week Janos is otherwise engaged.
!note MairBear no exalted finale this week Janos is otherwise engaged.
Rip this weeks gaming.
I am never 100% on Mair's casing could you pass that on if he shows up and doesn't get the note?
Ehh. I kind of want to make a monk in ToS.
But leveling one would be a pain in the ass.
So monk is a subclass of cleric who is more a caster using int/spirit.
But monk is str.
So Glenn to send Mail in BS you have to have bought their real-money currency at least once.
MairBear that sounds dumb.
I'm in no rush but might I use you to tranfer goods at a later time >.>'.
Is the public chat in BnS still literally unusable?
Anathema have you given the fallout 4 survival mode beta thing a try ?
SunTiger nope going to complete the story with my current character on normal sorta normal using those esps may have messed it up who knows.
It has all those terrible tihngs you like.
Like getting tired and sick and thirsty.
It has no fast travel at all though right?
Which is balls p.
How do I get one? D.
Well not yet I guess but I'll keep an eye open on SA and /tg/.
>reading either of those websites and not wanting to rip my eyes out.
I said I will you imbecille =|.
This obviously then implies I will pass down the information. But maybe I won't because you're such a huge jerk >=|.
The text snippet there implies webstore at least and possibly GW stores too but >implying they'll make decent enough stocks of them.
Bet you have to buy a certain amount of stuff first too.
Probably gonna DC me again when I close the window.
I didn't make a screen for it.
I just pressed up and enter and it made an irc channel cause I forgot it rebooted.
There might be magic you can do to get screen to steal with process.
I'll just make a screen at some point.
It isn't easy and I'd need to install another program.
You want to do it now don't you.
Not really it most likely wont work.
You can setup your bash.rc so that it automatically goes into a screen though for future.
-z $STY screen -Rd irc.
I like ancient harbinger a lot.
4/6 is a good statline.
If there is nothing on the board that kills it its likely safe-ish.
Still not overwhelmingly good.
I always thought it was Y'saarj.
Never saw the h.
Well the H then brings out the 'sha' element of MoP.
Otherwise they'd just be sa.
Well it's thousands of years and all that the language could have added words as it stole others.
Noelor yeah we should do Civil War when is it out?
I shouldn't still be in Glasgow.
I will have to let you know closer.
ChaosSmurf yeah your location is what I was unsure of.
You could come here maybe?
That'll be easier if he has a place in bath.
Bath is probably further than Glasgow from me.
Fucking brittain i can't keep trac of all your places.
Maybe meet midway somewhere midlands ish.
What movie are you seeing.
I still hold you should see animal town.
I will probably see zootopia this weekend.
I wanted to see Zootropolis but Dob didn't /.
Guess its grimdark superheroes then.
Instead of happy animal cops ?
Bunny cop movie etc.
I wish I'd made that pun before I saw it C.
I wish that thing came out on blu-ray faster.
Well that show was messed up.
Ex3 up for sale on DriveThruRPG.com for the general public maybe as soon as next week. yay just in time for the end of my game!
Though also y'know see it when I believe it etc.
Also I'm now following up grumpyman vs blandman tomorrow with bunny cop movie on sunday.
This unique and unforgiving 3D isometric RPG set in an original dark low fantasy world Dark Souls? Never heard of it no...
What game is tihs about if not dark souls ?
Some early access thing featured on steam.
Heartpwn published some april fools HS patchnotes.
In order to improve relations between different Blizzard game communities the Innkeeper is now Tracer and talks to the player before and after every game.
Tavern Brawls in Europe will now begin early Thursday morning instead of Wednesday evening.
Developer Note We love listening to community feedback and agree that It is unfair to Europeans that they have to stay up late to get their Brawl on. See you Thursday mornings!
Due to an overwhelming request for consistency between the games the Death Knight Monk and Demon Hunter classes have been removed from World of Warcraft.
<- the HS reddit has improved itself.
Its not the yugioh reddit.
Not an april fools in this case p.
Are yo sure ?
Its not actually funny though.
I am glad I switched away from gmail.
Anathema didn't seem to appear in the corporate gmail.
Ftrbzzs probably only gmail accounts not whatever the paid-for one is being on the paid-for one usually stops you using certain google things or maybe they removed it.
Haven't opened my personal gmail today so completely missed on the mic dropping action.
And I have a feeling that the lawsuits might be a bit too big even for google if they did a silly in corporate gmails.
Damn summer temperatures at 48 °C in southern Finland.
Better get my swimming trunks out.
Double digit temperatures today.
I cycled to the gym in shorts.
My hands were cold as hell though there was frost this morning.
Anathema the ice cover has almost cracked in the bay here!
No need to use my axe anymore when swimming.
Hm weird. I kind of like the new layout of GoogleChan only wish that they were availabie in dark grey and black like what I usually have.
Ftrbzzs seems it was removed 5 hours ago or more.
Oh god the d3 reddit.
MoonWolf is it styled?
Oh I have a stylish theme.
Now I am not saying that ToS has a gold seller problem.
But the word on the boards is that the 5-20 second freezes we get are due to massive amount of gold spam.
Its a pity this game will fail horribly if the devs don't wisen up since it is really charming in its own way.
Now thats some gold-selling.
Also I've tried farming a monster for the last hour.
Problem is that its not spawning.
Haven't seen a single one.
I mean it has a spawn rate of 1minute for 3 mobs but even so I would expect to see at least one in 60 spawns.
I also heard the controlls are terrible ?
Controls fine for me.
Then again I'm playing a caster.
I mean I do have trouble aiming at times but I assume that is because of my keyboard.
I know it's a bit short notice now.
But does anyone fancy playing Fiasco tonight in absence of Exalted?
If i get back on time.
I don't know when i'll be back.
So probably not on time.
I'll play if we get enough people.
Just have to go buy something to drink for that improvisational boost.
Okay not the greatest one tbh.
Huh no HOTS OW or Diablo April Fools that I could find. The Warcraft one is eugh while the SC2 one is better.
They might just be later.
One from Heroes gone live now.
Street view for the bg map viewer only dragonshire.
That must have taken some seiruos actual work.
Explains the current state of game balance and development.
E-yup space patrol luluco is certainly a trigger series.
Are we talking little witch academia here or inou battle nichijou whatever it was.
In between inferno cop and KlK with the animation style of panty stocking.
Ftrbzzs huh redhat o_0.
Also inou battle nichiwhatsitsface was trigger? Huh. Never knew that.
Anathema unity sure jetbrains i can see.
Where the hell did that come from.
Okay this is as good as the Eli Roth trailer.
MoonWolf the self-driving bike is A+.
Is this you back btw?
Or having not yet left?
Not having left yet.
Anathema Cooked_Auto MairBear up for Fiasco tonight given lack of Exalted?
Asked earlier got maybes from MW and Glenn.
To be specific I'll play if we get enough people.
And MW if he gets home in time.
I was never good at making up stuff on the spot so.
Signs have been placed over many mailboxes with the words “Dance Studio” to promote awareness of this feature which has existed in the game for over a decade.
Noelor not sure... what sort of time?
MairBear usual game sort of time depending on when MW gets back from his sister's.
If he gets back too late we won't play.
I mean officially game runs with 3 but imo 4 is better.
The /laugh voiceover audio for all races has been replaced with a recording of Ben Brode. Including the Gnome Female. Especially the Gnome Female.
If it helps anyone decide I just finished writing up a playset for a game set in Creation.
I love April 1st patch notes..
Eye Beam has been given an extensive polish pass resulting in many improvements to aesthetics build quality and customer usability. We’re very excited to introduce the all-new iBeam SE Pro.
I also have playsets here for a Local News Channel a la Anchorman Small-Town University and The Zoo.
Druids with Glyph of the Cheetah active will now receive a buff for eating donuts. v.
And a few spy-based ones.
Mage Armor has decided to embrace its inner beauty and donated its icon to charity.
Casting Blink will now occasionally cause the Mage to inform nearby players of the current location of the cavalry.
The “Lifecycles” talent has been renamed “Circulation” to prevent it being confused with those awesome motorcycles from TRON.
Look. We already gave you guys Ashbringer. Isn’t that enough?
The Shadow talents “Legacy of the Void” “Reaper of Souls” and “Fortress of the Mind” have been removed so as not to cause confusion with expansions for other Blizzard titles.
Die by the Sword now properly kills the Warrior when used as intended.
Using Pistol Shot will now cause Outlaw rogues to declare the current time of day which is always high noon for some reason.
Death has found out that you’ve been Cheating it all these years and isn’t pleased. It’s pretty miffed about it to be honest.
The talent �Barrage� has had its functionality extended to also pull extra packs from completely different dungeons <- so nothing changed?
Noelor got to do a thing but should be around 40 mins or so after.
So... if that's enough time then okies.
Soo that thing happening?
MoonWolf omg the rageiorc tavernbrawl shaman.
Depends when MoonWolf gets back.
0 jobs near Glasgow UK.
No Fiasco I guess.
All the moon none of the wolf.
Noelor just cancelled it.
I took too long.
It's up to you guys.
Takes few hours to fiasco anyway.
It runs 2-3 hours.
We can just talk shit on mumble.
Depends how late people wanna be up.
I was up earl.
So i don't want to go to bed super late.
I figured as much.
Is there anything shorter on any platform?
GlennCuttlefish look okay i had planned my uncling after tonight was cancelled.
How dare you do family things.
I just do i don't give a fuck.
Something along those lines.
Anyhow hopping on mumble in a few moments guess I'll go smoke a quick pipe first.
MoonWolf stopping us have a communal wenk.
MairBear general intelligence o7.
Meanwhile in finland.
Very important elevator.
So a friend informed me of this happening Content Warning Bondage Lesbians ->.
Just in case.
Everybody get up we're in japan now /.
...well it is nearly working time.
Posting for best dog.
Dob unless you object I'm going to order tickets for 14.20 when I wake up.
No arguments from me.
I really wish I could get the dumb idea of making a Warcraft campaign in 13th Age out of my head.
Seems like a great idea.
Maybe but you willingly forget how I am with rules and game mechanics p.
Noelor i fixed a problem you had.
PatternSpider can do this now.
Could it not always?
Or like obviously not always but.
I thought it used to.
Before this incarntion of PS.
So over 3 years.
And your inevitable forward progress.
Not sure about lost village yet.
It has potential but the first episode was just a really misanthropic community college class taking a long bus trip to silent hill. Maybe they might even get there next episode.
New animu this season.
GlennCuttlefish that video seems pretty #finland.
Yes this seems like a show worth existing.
Thanks deviant art.
I've seen lustier argonians.
Look the internet is how it is.
I'm not going to pretend otherwise.
MairBear trolden re-featured the same damn fuck pries tavern brawl game.
Oh fair enough then.
This has been slowly spreading over my facebook lately.
Importantly it has Steven Universe eyes.
I dont suppose anyone has a link to mairs exalted character?
GlennCuttlefish I have link to all their characters.
If you need 'em.
I will possibly need other next week for now I just need mair's sheet just in case my party decides to be uncorteous for once.
If you are discourteous eat three attacks in a round.
You're going to make them fight a dawn with a grimsycthe...
I am hoping it won't come to that.
Usually in the situation I will place the character in they will not fight.
However my party also does have a habit of not completely demolishing everything I have planned.
MoonWolf As the resident 13th Age expert do you think these class comparisons work?
Not really feeling the warlock as sorc.
That one was the hardest tbh.
Necro was the closest I could think of but you refluff it.
Mostly because of minions and such.
You can reskin a bunch of their undead as demons.
Yeah you'd have to reskin everything and then it works.
Sorc definitly not really.
That was bascially the idea here.
Mage is probs sorc/wizard.
Rather than just sorc.
Leaned more towards Sorc because it seemd easier to pull off.
Well you don't need to really change anything for them.
If they want to be the sorc of mage that throws fireballs there yu go sorc.
Imo you're just after a If you play this WoW class consider this/these 13A classes.
If you want to be the sort of mage that summons food and polymoprhs people.
Or you can be generous and say mage is a wizard that can take sorc spells at will.
On which note I'd put warrior druid in shaman.
Because it's a humanoid druid who hits people with nature-magic-enhanced hammers and junk.
Probably remove that one from the druid one.
Also worth considering a 13A melee ranger for WoW combat rogue.
Trickiest part of me is figuring out all the race powers and adjusments.
Lich King and Scourge separately?
Somewhat pre-TBC. Post the Exodar arriving but before the portal opening.
Campaign brief at the bottom.
I don't think you can separate the Lich King from the Scourge then.
Perhaps but I reckoned they could still be seen as separate entities with how they may influence things.
The entire Scourge is controlled directly by Arthas.
Post Bolvar a more general control iirc.
I guess. Just thought they would have different narrative pulls in this case with how the scourge undead are in the plaguelands meanwhile Arthas had a more direct pull to others There must always be a corruption plotline.
You could lose something precious to the scourge but not really have it involve the lich king while Arthas could do something to you more directly. But the combination of the two works as well.
Fury warrior is Barbarian btw.
But what does that make Fighter and COmmander? Arms and Prot?
I want this phone but it isn't release for like 3 months.
I mean it looks like a fine phone but thermal imaging?
Cooked_Auto Commander isn't really warrior imo.
If you're sticking to the WoW models of these classes.
Because there's no version of WoW's warrior that shouts at their allies constantly.
Other than shouts are fighters' raid buffs I guess.
Noelor maybe there should be.
I want to play a heal warrior.
Shout at my raid.
Untill they stop fucking up.
I am sure I know at least one or two more that would want to do that.
Omg the description of the bug that let cats get drunk is amazing.
So 13A classes that aren't represented in WoW bard chaos mage commander monk if restricted to vanilla occultist.
Chaos Mage could be a special Mage in this case.
But that would be an edge case in my book.
It's probably going to be like the Occultist your One Unique Thing explains why you're that class.
Tauren can't be locks either btw.
And I was even looking at wowpedia v.
Technically some races can't be rogues either but that restriction is dumb.
You can't be a rogue if you have hooves.
Because you can't have quiet hoovesteps.
That's the rule in WoW.
As said the restriction is dumb.
MoonWolf the df guy doesn't use version control D.
Anathema i'm not suprised.
MairBear do you hve kudranis charms written down anywhere? I want to murder my exalted party if they do something very dumb.
DF is like bad development practices the project.
You... you want to import a Kudrani? xD.
GlennCuttlefish the sheet has tabs.
I can give the whole character sheet if you wish but you may want to buff further.
One of the tabs is charms.
Oh so it does didn't notice that before.
I do have a notepad which is all the charms copy pasted from book so I can refer easier.
It's messy but it is there.
Could you please link it?
Does that have the notepad data somewhere?
I'm just sprucing up the notepad with the artifact weapon info too.
But then will deposit link.
As I warned it's highly messy and not even in a perfect order but I did split them into movement dodge/survival and offensive groups.
Cooked_Auto btw I reckon you give trolls Is that your best shot? the dwarven racial power to represent trollblood regeneration.
Unsure if you then give dwarves something else.
Orcs are probs just 13A half-orcs.
Troll ability bonus is I think dex and con?
There used to be stat differences between races in WoW might still be in fact.
Maybe look at those.
Yeah I might just do an ability approxmiation based on the Warcraft stats.
Str Dex Stamina for Con Spirit for Wis.
And Int is either Int or Cha?
P72 forgeborn power could work for forsaken?
Gnomes are more like halflings than 13a gnomes.
Draenei are basically aasmiar.
Or you use the Tiefling score adjustment and come up with another race power.
I meant aasimar racial power.
Gift of the Naaru is halo.
So I did the 'run an android emulator to pretend you have a galaxy s6 to get 3 hearthstone packs and a card back' game last night.
Curse of Chaos I don't think you use for any of these.
First pack dropped 2 annoyotrons. Guess I'm okay with that.
A promotion that came out last yr play hearthstone on s6. Turns out you can run an android emulator like it's app dev software dl hearthstone for it run on desktop get the loot.
Imo humans also want Surprising instead of Quick to Fight but I dunno how that balances with the bonus feat it probably doesn't but I'm ok with removing humans' be the best status.
Not sure Halo works as a Gift of the Naaru since the former is more defence than heal orientated.
I'm modelling a HoT as more resilience.
Healing all over the place doesn't work too great in 13A.
Draenei has Heroic Presence which ups Str Agi and Int so going with the Tiefling +2 Str or +2 Int makes more sense to me than +2 Wis or +2 Cha.
But like while the pairs aren't completely arbitrary you can definitely use any of the... 15ish? combinations.
Rather than be constricted to what's there.
Because in 13A you just pick one of those two.
Yeah probably make up some new combos for some races.
Night Elves for instance don't get any attribute bonuses.
Like I'd give orc str/con.
...p sure nelves are dex/wis.
I meant in WoW in this case =p.
Oh wait you mean passive abilities.
Just the passive racial bonuses in this case and not the starting attributes and such.
Only Tauren and Draenei actually get passive attribute racials.
And those racials are terrible.
Fuck all the tiny bonuses racials.
I think they did get rid of them.
Probably have Dex/Str for Night Elves and Int/Cha for Blood Elves.
Or just Dex/Wis for Night Elves even.
Tauren con/wis dwarves maybe str/wis?
Human might just go with +2 to any ability score.
I'd go with cha/str and cha/dex for forsaken.
Why Cha/Dex for Forsaken? Doesn't seem to fit them.
Dex is definitely right.
I guess. Does also make the spread somewhat even.
They're quick and limber not mighty or tough.
Cha because they cast spells through force of will rather than study imo.
Like a forsaken mage would be sorc > wizard mostly.
Oh yeah the Midgard Bestiary has an undead playable race.
It's a lot of rules.
Kobold power in there works for gnomes maybe?
Possibly although it might just be better to stick with the core books.
Not sure if you could pull of Shadowmeld as the Night Elf racial power.
If you can't think of a good mechanic give it to them as a free +2 or +3 background.
The only ones missing racial powers now is humans night elves dwarves tauren and blood elves.
Dwarves want something to save early.
Maybe they roll a save when they rally? or straight-up end an ongoing?
I think you can probbaly give nelves the wood elf power and belves the high elf power without feeling too weird.
This might result in more nelves being in the game but that's pretty representative of WoW!
Teleport otoh seems odd so I might just give them the dark elf power.
That leaves Tauren then.
That feels weirder imo.
Belves have magic and arcane bullshit.
Yeah but they've always been portrayed as kind of cruel and capricious at the same time.
There is no point to really make their arcane addiction a thing because there is no decent magic mechanic.
Well magic points mechanic.
You could give them Quick to Fight otherwise.
Humans get surprising in this case and maybe the extra feat.
Then suddenly the narrated WC2 intro came on foobar D.
Probably skip out on giving humans the extra feat thing.
And Belves get Quick to Fight instead of cruel.
Bear in mind gnomes should have Small too.
Probs need to give belves a bit more.
And then if they're a wizard free feat.
Tauren maybe get Toughness.
Because obviously they don't get Small.
Everybody is medium anyway.
Size classes aren't a thing.
Except gnomes obviously while Tauren are just medium big.
Small is just a bonus gnomes and halflings get.
Well you know what I mean anyway.
Oh clerics get ritual for free too.
Mebz necro you'd have to check.
For flavour might just give Nelves a bonus feat if they pick druid and the same for Draenei and Paladins because who closely tied those two are to those classes.
Nelves have wis draenei have str right?
Those stats are good for those classes.
Guess the hurdle with the races done at least. Still not too sure about icons and if thats a good mix.
Depends how parallel you want them to be to 13A's.
I tried that didn't work.
That was my starting point for the icons until I realized not all of them worked. I mean Thrall isn't really the Orc Lord in this case and who would be the Priestess?
Priestess might be Tyrande but who then would take the slot as Elf Queen? Diabolist is just a huge ??? and the same with The Prince of Shadows.
So yeah I realized quickly that didn't work and I'd have to make those up from scratch.
Jaina's faction is Theramore right?
Jaina is separate because she has ties to both Alliance and Horde.
Equivalent to Steamwheedle I guess.
Ravenholdt was a bit of a copout because I wanted a bunch of extra ambigious ones.
Cult of the Damned.
Is the Twilight's Hammer to the Scourge/Lich King's Legion.
Forgot they were a thing during vanilla.
Don't think Old Gods are active in the world enough to be an icon?
The evil version of Argent Dawn.
They seem too small and specific to Plaguelands.
Who are still Dawn atm I think?
Kind of like Defias.
Argent Dawn are also only in Plaguelands.
Good point didnt come up with that many good icons.
Scarlet Crusade were the undead haters that were ruled by disguised demons.
They had enough of an impact really to be counted no?
Think you should probs drop Naaru if it's pre-tBC.
There's like one in Azeroth?
Its sorta around TBC since its post Exodar crash.
Its just before that point where Outland happens.
There is also the one in Silvermoon.
The reason why Belves had Paladins.
So that icon would be more specific to Draenei and Belves in this case.
Its not a big figure heading an org.
Two Naaru one of whom is being chained up as a battery isn't really a faction/icon.
Its just a single trapped naaru.
It has no agency.
It has no power.
Narrative power i mean.
Sure its a naaru it can presumably do naaru things.
Well unless you want to say they influence people subtly.
Like calling out to light worshippers and such.
Then you'd be better off having the bloodelf faction and/or its leadership subtly influenced by it.
Then again I should probably drop Council of Tirisfal since that only got rebooted with ugh Me'dan later on.
If I remember right.
Then see what narrative stuff you're missing.
Because Alliance and Horde imo aren't monolith enough to be icons.
I was probably just going to allow players to break down the Alliance/Horde ones into more specifc ones as well.
Like if you do the... 8 capitals?
Then a few of the evil factions.
Lesse WoWpedia listing for neutrals are Argent Dawn Bloodsail Buccaneers Brood of Nozdormu Cenarion Circle Darkmoon Faire Gelkis Clan Centaur Hydraxian Waterlords Magram Clan Centaur Ravenholdt Shen'dralar Syndicate Thorium Brotherhood Timbermaw Hold Zandalar Tribe.
You can also do this take alliance and horde so whoever in charge of the horde during the period you are in. and probably varian.
I could add Dalaran as neutral now that I think about it.
Nah Varian wouldn't be in this case. At least not from the start. Because one of my plotline ideas is just the missing diplomant quest.
So far the only story ideas I have is Hogger and Missing Diplomat P.
Then take the subversive faction for alliance and horde so Sylvannas for horde and probably night elves for alliance.
Then sprinkle in other icons depending on what/where/how your story goes.
Because i can literally make 50 of the things from wow lore.
Its too big for a small set.
I try to skip the smaller ones like the centaur clans and such because they're irrelevant.
Yeah and at the same time things like Thorium Brotherhood and tbh Cenarion Circle are just neutral extensions of racial factions dwarves and nelves in this instance.
But at the same time the Cenarion Circle influence is both over Alliance and Horde.
Since you have Tauren amongst their ranks.
Just not up amongst the leadership.
Or very high up even.
Cenarion Circle are just a coalition of Darnassus and Thunder Bluff folks.
If you're considering the races as factions you can probably lose things like Defias and CotD too.
Replace Jaina with Dalaran maybe think she's part of the council officially.
The problem is though that from a narrative stand point few factions have much of a push or pull and are just acting within their zones so you'd have to take some concessions with it.
Or at least a narrative stand point as seen from the game itself.
Remove that factor and a lot of the factions can have a greater influence.
Kind of funny just how much dead space there was on the map back then.
Watching arrow guess i had too at some point.
So far bodyguard guy is the best guy by far.
For the first time I'm glad steam prevents the PC shutting down quickly. Cos I accidentally hit shut down. I'm good at name a thing.
GlennCuttlefish seems I cornered the golden deva essence market well...
They went from 15s each to 2s each.
Still got too many that didn't sell though C.
Remember to give your snek tea.
Well did not manage to wipe my party but I did force them to flee.
GlennCuttlefish i'm sure mairbear will be happy.
Oh I didn't even end up using mairs character base yet.
Don't worry it is clear they will fight the faction that character is in at some point.
And that scythe-murder ?
Also features young tracer.
Not as much younger as i thought originally.
Features regular tracer then i guess.
More importantly it was preceded by an advent for Disneyland/world which I need to share with MoonWolf.
Are the sectiods taking over disneyland.
First Disneyland tomorrow THE WORLD!
Or Disneyworld even v.
This is going to be a pain to find on youtube now.
Noelor I found the ads before mind to be absolutely cringe.
I'm nto te target audience though so w/e.
Noelor no luck ?
Its not a big deal.
But ok so the theme was Even if your kids are growing up they'll still love going to Disneyland.
Which is a cute message and all.
But one of them was like When your girls start admiring different princesses.
And the shot was this girl looking at this other girl and I was like.
So you take your daughter to Disneyland if you think she's realising she's a lesbian?
A lesbian into princesses!
Take her to the frozen ride.
That was literally it.
It sounds like a genuine attempt to be inclusive. that was. not well executed.
Nah I think it's just.
An editting choice that I and others like me are bound to misconstrue.
Noelor now you can probably tell why I was adamant for it to be seen though right?
It's definitely my favourite talking animal thing since lion king but that's an easy category.
<- i can't believe CS has not reported the shit out of tihs.
That portmanteau doesn't even work.
Happy you-got-older day MairBear.
Take skeleton-based comics as implied yes.
Happy survival day mair I would buy you something nice but.
The only birthday-related file in my reactions folder is.
My reactions folder isn't that big.
It's kind of birthday partyish maybe?
*shrug* best I had.
Pretty pure 90's anime.
Downside of this entire wknd spent watching the heroes world championship vod's... the kpop is getting repetitive.
They keep using the same tracks >_<.
Drunk metal gear history has gotten VERY DRUNK.
Cheers loving intensifies.
Is lesbian in british intensifies.
Someone has found out panel layouts that are not 2x2.
>all language settings are en-GB Word still saying 'colour' isn't a word...
Anathema also the spell checking settings in Word?
For that specific document?
Maybe it j ust isn't a word.
Cooked_Auto can you buy it online or only in store? I'm doing an obstacle race on the 16th.
But you probably be on it like flies on shit because it'll be gone fast.
I might be overdoing this v.
Also I have forgotten how weird the original opening narrations are.
Exalted needs to be out already.
I wanna pitch it to my WHFRP group.
I don't have a physical 3rd edition rulebook.
Lets not kid ourselves I'm gonna have like 3.
Cooked_Auto rip that guy.
Man I am tempted to stream TFA on May 4th.
I wonder what a decent tablet for PDFs would go for.
Anathema Regarding the Anniversary min from the 40k FB And yes as a lot of you have been asking you can also pick both up online at games-workshop.com or join the party in your local Warhammer or Games Workshop store.
MairBear So unstable ghoul is going away and basically it only showed up in warrior decks.
So now we have.
So it makes up for it i guess.
I'd not be too enthused about the cost and effect if it were in any deck other than warrior.
Still not a decent grim patron enabler.
So that deck is staying in wild.
Drunk metal gear history has gotten VERY DRUNK <- if this was going to happen for any game it needed to be this one.
I like how they summed up MGR in like five minutes.
It needed its own episode.
But they were getting pretty embarrasing towards the end there.
Ironicus was embarassing himself by MGS1 =P.
Just too drunk to notice.
Well I mean yes.
But whenever it was he started licking things.
Maybe they'll make lp videos again now.
Instead of drunken videos.
MoonWolf I think it was a bit of a buffer to let them actually record some of... whichever game it is they're going on to.
Wonder why everyone is late to WHFRP -> cancelled and my phone didn't do a notification for the email.
I'm glad I decided to check FB mid-afternoon.
Exalted was cancelled because Janos has become a time-traveller.
Ok so what he said was I'll be travelling at the time.
But at least half of us read I'll be travelling in time.
Noelor you read it right. He just went back and edited it.
Noelor being a phone is quite convenient wouldn't mind a spell that lets me do that.
Shame all these characters are terrible wizards.
EGS needs a competent wizard.
Maybe Sarah will be good at being a wizard.
She seems pretty into it.
13th age generator now has all official stuff in it so you can generate to your hearts content.
And maybe one day actually play one of those.
Odd question how would you do Warcraft Demon Hunters in 13A? Or even DKs.
It got brought up on skype with my other group aka the ones I might just run 13A Warcraft with.
A highly reskinned rogue or barbarian maybe.
Its not really covered by any classes.
I realized that as well.
You could reskin barb to DK I reckon.
Especially with the right magic wepaons.
I was thinking of a special rule of possibly being allowed to take powers from other classes but you have to fluff them as class specific powers just to combat drought in some classes *coughroguescough*.
So officially multiclassing is there for that.
But yeah 13A is resilient enough that shuffling talents around isn't the end of the world.
Not to mention WoWpedia lets me get a good overlook on class powers so I can see what works and doesnt.
Statting out magical items for this could be fun though.
Rogue mirror match. Opponent concedes on turn 3 following my dropping of a shattered sun to buff a nov engi to counter his turn 2 kobold.
I mean thank you and everything but damn.
Tales of the low ranks is sort of fun.
And i'm not going to claim to be some master of HS.
But i just don't even get plays like you see most of the time.
The good old ranks where whoever goes first ends turn and whoever goes second coins and hero powers.
Drat I can't come up with a good name for the house rule that's a WoW reference P.
Don't zoom in if you're avoiding Life is Strange spoilers but this is the decision tree for just one scene in... I think we're on ep 4?
I'm hoping this is an unusually large example.
There are a lot of variables in play by that point in the game.
And if you look there's only a handful of real variables in the outcome.
You told me not to look!
Here have this.
I should really catch up.
I just don't have the attention span for subs lately.
And by lately I mean for over a year.
Yes found the perfect name for the house rule in question 3c.
I guess starfire is a magicla girl now.
To be fair all of the Titans have a transformation sequence in that movie.
7 had that inexplicable sequence with Glaswegian gangsters.
Now I am used to dense anime protagonists but this one doesn't realize his partner is a woman.
When she is in a skin tight outfit.
Oh yeah I should download the Phoenix Wright episode.
Maybe he doesn't want to make cisnormative assumptions ok?
I wonder if Girls und Motorbikes has started airing yet.
Noelor now we could assume that japan has somehow started taking western sensibilities into account.
Or we can assume that its just yet another dense anime protagonist.
I noticed GuM has started airing now so.
Obviously he's just superdence.
Noelor i've only seen one anime in my life that would do this and that was Log Horizon i blame .hack//sign for this.
But I can make jokes I.
I just reminded myself of Zootropolis.
Seriously i don't even know how it happened but Log Horizon is suprisingly cool about queer folk.
It's okay when a bunny calls another bunny cute...
Is Log Horizon that one about the Database?
And the living in thereof?
It features the most stereotypical camp gay guy you can imagine.
Live in a guild that dedicated to being fangirls of the guildleader.
And not once not even once is that played for laughs or even mentioned as weird.
Except perhaps by existing.
MairBear I got up to the last Lysandre fight.
I had forgotten his stupid fucking Doc Ock getup -_-.
In the second season there is a super annoying idol type character they're crossdressing. nobody has yet asked why nobody has brought it up in public.
Just at some point a few character figure it out talk about it amongst this fact amongst themselves and move on with their lives.
I thought it was IRL I'm a guy but I rolled a female character.
At minimum it's an RP server.
Okay it's been a while.
Oh god the PW anime opening is bad.
Regardless the point was that someone figures this out they talk about it then move on with their lives.
The OP was pretty bad the ED is decent.
Dob they're talking about Phoenix Wright.
Glenn I do love the text boxes.
Noelor> alright thanks I withdraw.
Oh god that CGI D.
Despite the horrendous CGI for the courtroom the PW anime is pretty good.
It has the correct poses and such.
Ie all the important stff.
Even has the witness freaking out.
Well it lacks some of the music.
Does it also have bullshit magical powers ?
Can't wait to see maya next episode.
Dont know yet it's just the first case from the first game.
Almost certainly since the first episode followed the trial case faithfully.
Oh my god the Objection part D.
!note MairBear this is worth reading.
This might be interesting to some.
Wait Inferno Space Cop is in Space Patrol Luluco? Well I'm watching it for sure now.
The show will resume airing new episodes in June 2016 as part of the Summer of Steven event. It was also announced that the show was renewed for a fourth and fifth season.
Glenn Remember Don't Space Cheat.
Time to watch Girls und Motorcycles ep 1.
Relevant again because of the new baldurs gate game.
Huh Outsider updated again.
I don't think my heart can take all these outsider updates.
At least rate its updating faster than megatokyo.
No I'm pretty sure MT updates faster than Outsider.
At least we still have that going.
Cooked_Auto how was cute girls on motercycles doing moe things ?
Okay I guess. The fact that the bike spoke was weird and I have to check with a friend who has actively read the manga to see if that is a reoccuring thing or not because Gold Digger bike was... weird.
But Stig's Japanese younger cousin was good while the main character was perhaps slightly too... quasi-dense.
Didn't see the bike talking coming.
So here I was listening to the latest hardcore history podcast. Dan Carlin is great at orating his stuff but there is usually a rhytm to it. You can feel when it ends.
I thought to myself he is getting on the point and there are slightly longer pauses in his speech maybe this is coming to an end. Maybe I'll listen to this before I start eating my dinner and watching something else.
You were horribly mistaken ?
I check the podcast just in case. 3 hours remaining.
He got to the end of his opening point.
Opening point of second part of this topic.
Oh neat persian history.
Persian history and then a lot of people got stabbed with swords.
Pity I've got enough of a backlog of Star Wars and Rogue Trader campaign podcasts to last me a while to really bother with HH.
Not to mention that The Independent Characters have started airing again too.
Joker game has some serious promise.
New anime this season.
I'm probably just gonna stick with Phoenix Wright and Bakuon.
Could've sworn it was a third series too but the name eludes me.
Oh and the new Studio Trigger one becasue it looks retarded as all hell but does have Inferno Space Cop.
The main character is a military academy graduate who is sent to work at a spy training facility. He is also somewhat naive and hates spies it seems.
There's still another trigger show coming this month as well.
Lemme go check the ADTRW season thread.
Wait was that later? I for some reason remembered it was this month.
Starts airing on the 9th.
Oh yeah Macross Delta.
Oh shit first episode has aired.
Aha apparently the talking bike thing is a one time thing.
For some reason the main character in Bakuon imagines her training bike talking to her.
Couldn't get that far into the episode I guess.
For some reason it didn't really work for me even if it meets the requirements of having 1 anime girls 2 Doing bullshit things.
Yeah it's kind of saved by having Stig's Japanese cousin.
I mean she is mute she wears a white helmet with a black visor all the time. What else can she be?
Also the helmet has a bow on the back.
Sister is now back in town. As a result my ping is dreadful and twitch is struggling to 1080p S.
Lovely apparently roll20 updated their API and now shits busted.
Nvm it worked after reloading the room.
Apparently no dice or character avatars were visible before that.
Oh comes with updates sheets.
MoonWolf is the level info on topic for TGAO correct?
Did we get any advances?
MoonWolf I trust you've seen The Ancient One that the new Blood of the Ancient One refers to but if not.
Oh so it is an actual Warcraft related art thing.
Saw the full art elsewhere but wasnt sure if it was real or not.
Yeah it does look a little different for WoW.
Blame Chronicles I guess or something.
Ooooh boooooy we're now up against a damn security droid with a turbo laser.
...Just how massive is that droid?
Sounds like me in the shower.
GlennCuttlefish its accurate now.
The other day a friend expressed surprise that I didn't really like Dark Souls since like it I am stoic but whimsical.
Anathema what do they know 8-.
Not what i'd describe it as.
Ftrbzzs hey I'll take stoic but whimsical!
Anathema I'll go for 'merry Scotsman' 8-.
Anathema could i possibly get an actual blowjob with that written one that is the vivaldi release statement ?
Only if you have an existing teledildonics setup.
I'll never forget Opera 12.16 _.
Ftrbzzs Geoff is in a really fancy suit today.
My world doesn't make sense.
My phone froze when I tried.
Its like looking at cthulhu.
Anathema Geoff said he won't take a selfie with the suit on so I trust you to take a photo.
Use his phone if yours won't function in his presence.
We were in a rather precarious situation last night in EotOR.
You need a bigger ship.
A much much bigger ship.
You see that ship to the right? That's ours now.
What about the other two ?
By which I meant the small one next to The part p.
Oh and all of the characters have a 500 million credit bounty on their heads. Each.
You should cash in on that.
That would be tricky since we're wanted by everyone.
Just turn your whole party in then break em out again free money.
Ah it was just 500 million credits for all us and we're wanted by The Hutts the Exchange the Pirate Lords the Sith Empire and the Republic.
Or as the NPC who rescued us said Yeah congratulations on beating my bounty you lucky bastards.
So now the party is under the protection of the Drayven Syndicate and we have our own ship one of these.
A not quite falcon ?
Actually more like A not quite Ebon Hawke P.
It's the smuggler ship from TOR in this case.
Considering the campaign is called Edge of the Old Republic the YT-1300 doesnt really exist yet.
But so far we've learned that Czerka corporation is Evil. Capital letter evil.
Who could have seen this coming.
Weeeeell suddenly opening fire in a star port and then gunning down civilians might be a very obvious clue.
I give up 5½ hours of sleep it is.
Its close to getting decent sleep.
8 hours is decent sleep.
7 hours is close to decent sleep.
5½ is I welcome the sleep eternal slumber of death.
Still today's date cool.
Nobody's imminently pregnant this week?
I forsee no problems with todays game unless i just fuck up.
Or mairbear doesn't show up.
Minister exalted this week?
If it isn't I can't do next week p.
That's ok neither can I.
<- thats probably enough colours.
I'm going to interpret that as please clarify.
Today blizzard banned a whole bunch of D3 players for botting or using map hacks. this is the second such wave of bans in about a months time.
MoonWolf actually in response to your other link.
Minister i'm adding some common utility tables to bonsai to make future stuff easier.
And figured i need some colours.
So i got 16 common colours then some more highly used colours.
Then i got ALL THE COLOURS WITH WIKIPEDIA PAGES.
Too many colours.
Which is a colour.
Its color like fanfiction is literature.
Its a colour now get used to it.
Fine don't get used to it.
See if i care.
I'll just browse everything on my shitty monitor.
And then I can't even tell the difference.
And since I can't see the difference it is not true for me.
Ergo zaffre is not a color.
I'm not sure thats math Minister.
Actually i'm sure its not.
GlennCuttlefish do you want to practice feats of strength on local fauna before game tonight?
MairBear err. give me 15 minute if a friend doesn't how up and I am not dragged into playing ToS sure.
Sur e sure sure.
GlennCuttlefish I did a lot of crafting stuff to catch it up and killed that scorpion a thousand times but I've not actually got up to much beyond that.
Well if you get too far ahead I'll do some daily dungeons at some point.
According to my friends list you're actually still ahead of me.
Well guess I am available for elevating the king of the forest.
Game is going to be late by an hour today due to dogs.
Hearthstone observation drawing dr. boom from a gvg booster a while back has given quite a few successes.
BwaS yes yes it would have.
Would be nice if you could dictate the bomb spawning so you can shove a flametongue totem between.
Patching is going to take 15-20 minutes it seems mair.
Because this downloader is bad.
GlennCuttlefish gives me time to sort out my spells in R20.
Have I told you how much I hate this client at times.
Restarting client fetching coffee and having a cigarette while it tries loading. Again.
Oh good MairBear's around.
MairBear if I'm late for game it's because I fell asleep on my sofa and you should txt/fb me.
So there's 2 sleep deprived or just tired people the GM's late because of surprise canines and then there's mair.
Today's game is going to be great.
And then there's mair!?
HOLY FUCK YOU PIECE OF SHIT CLIENT HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO CHECK THOSE FILES.
I just want to leave this to log in so I can have a smoke.
GlennCuttlefish sorry about canines ?
Normally i don't walk this dog in the evening but tonight noone else is around.
MoonWolf I wasn't complaining. I should insert more emoticons into my text.
Didn't fall asleep on a couch ?
MoonWolf what's been the chat out of the Diablo team recently.
ChaosSmurf not much really.
This seasons is pretty disapointed compared to last.
Bug fixes set tweaks.
When's it coming out?
Current season ends friday 15th. new season starts 29th.
Have they said when it launches?
Sorry how long it lasts even.
Same as last season 3 moths give or take.
If it goes 3.5 it'll end the same week as gamescom.
Or if it goes 3 and then there's a 2 week gap before start the next one will start the day after gamescom.
There is also some variability with how long ptr lasts bugs the crop up etc.
The 3 months is just a target.
Expansion at gamescom maybe.
If they have something else for bcon.
We'd probably be wrong because we're always wrong about d3 expansions.
I'm assuming there is an expansion coming but I thought that last year.
This season being lacklustre would suggest they're working on something else tho.
That or they're just done with it it now.
And in maintance mode.
I do wonder if they'll just do Diablo 4 instead.
That'd be years out still though.
With blizzard development timelines.
Depends how big the D3 team is.
And how big it needs to be for the content we've seen.
We get to find out if Bcon gets run on just here's next year's DLC or not.
Cause they won't have anything in dev by then except Legion year 2 Overwatch year 2 SC2 DLC year 2 Hearthstone Standard year 2.
Dlc dlc for everyone.
I'm okay with it.
Maybe they'll suprise announce a thing.
But the last Blizzcon they didn't have anything huge at was v. dull.
Also we were working on THIS THING all this time.
Though I guess this year they didn't have anything huge either but they had loads of stuff in dev.
And that they hide it better than 2014 v.
This coming blizzcon is basically just going to be WoW exansion blizzcon.
As far as i can tell.
Nah legion'll only be 2 months out.
Can't announce it that earlyu.
Man I want a meat doughnut.
Even if Legion is good.
GlennCuttlefish get a bagel put ham on it.
I am more likely to find meat doughnuts around here.
What we refer to as meatpie is actually a doughnut it seems.
MoonWolf it's also the 10th Blizzcon.
But since they skipped a couple of years that could just not mean anything.
Maybe it'll be blizzcon-con.
All about blizzcon as a community event.
I'm glad we're on the same page.
Just rename it djwheat tells some interesting stories and then tune out con.
C o r r e c t.
The fact I know I'm going to tune in for the keynote again makes me angry.
But then you are a very angry man.
Have you fixed your irc setup / screen thing.
That's why I logged in twice.
We really should just move to something like Discord though <_<.
That just means i have to run discord and irc.
Whatever other IRC channels you're in should also move to Discord! v.
I already run skype/discord/irc so.
Well and TS3/Mumble whenever.
ChaosSmurf i'll move to discord if mmoirc dies.
Lemme get Mark on the phone.
What do you use Discord for Cooked_Auto.
Arma 3 gaming group.
Just for a place to BS and discuss mods and such.
I use the Reddit Overwatch channel and one for Crate Crowbar.
But not very regularly.
More since I quit twitter.
I was wondering about that.
Why'd you quit twitter ?
All 2 of you ?
An even bigger reason as to why.
Looks like the reason that flipped him over was the ninty employee fired following a witch hunt.
Who was the other guy that quit?
And yes it was that + general despair.
I didn't delete my account though so I'll probably go back in a couple of weeks.
And i don't know anyone else that quit over that.
Just know one other scottish bearded games reviewer guy.
That's who I mean.
And yeah most people didn't even quit adoring everything Nintendo do like a bunch of disgusting sychophants in response so I'm not surprised.
What happened at Nintendo?
I totally missed this apparently.
They fired Alison Rapp after GG+usual suspects spent 2 months digging up dirt on her.
Because she's a woman.
Very very very short story internet people got angry at a woman working at nintendo over a thing she wasn't even responsible for or involved in.
Eventually nintendo decied the bad rep wasn't worth being decent human beings.
I believe the reason for the firing was the moonlighting.
The only thing they had to not do is not fire her.
Does Anyone buy that ?
Move department tell her to shut down her social accounts dock her pay.
But you don't fire her unless you have literally zero understanding of the last two years of the internet or are an actually heartless possibly malicious human being/moron.
I think at this point we should be specific that this was Nintendo of america.
And if actual nintendo was involved we have no clue.
Yeah it might have been from on high.
Either way it's the stupidest thing I've ever seen any company ever do.
And I watch wrestling.
~anyway~ it pissed me off so much I didn't want to be on Twitter that day and they're shutting down the desktop Tweetdeck client anyway so I just deleted it.
And I have to be logged into work's for most of the day and don't want to switch.
Using it as an FF tab works vOv.
I'd have to have a different browser.
I've logged in using Chrome's incognito mode to check DMs a couple of times.
MoonWolf can you come win a game of HS.
With a really good agro paladin deck.
It's mysterious challenger isnt it.
ChaosSmurf ths guy takes FOREVER for anything.
Either you have 2 damage in hand or you don't.
Just get it over with.
I love those players. The ones who have a moral crisis whether coining a hero power turn 1 is the right move.
The answer is no.
Not sure it's a moral decision?
There are some exceptions probably but feh.
The kind of anguish that gets down to the core of your soul as you watch the fuse.
P sure they're just bming.
Until game starts MairBear.
Of course right now I'm queueing.
If anyone does tune in let me know if sound works!
Noelor i'm a back.
Noelor> there does appear to be sound yes.
Cool. this wk's tavern brawl looks to be 'balanced' and not oh you only have core hounds well you're screwed.
But not all that good.
But maybe i'm biased.
You've only done it 4 times now.
Oh I like this brawl.
I like brawls that drop a pack with a golden of a card I actually use ^^.
Unstable portal gave me a minion that gains +2 atk for every opponent spell cast. Unstable Portal counts XD.
Spawned at like 3/something was at 13/something a short while later before they conceded.
Ftrbzzs pretty sure I saw a bunch of jobs from Remedy games when I had a quick look at lunch too >_>.
This brawl so random I ended up facing jaraxxus eredar lord of the burning legion.
Today's roll20 music.
Anathema Remedy Supercell Unity - there's plenty of options around.
This looks interesting.
ChaosSmurf lol now WoW is stealing d3 ideas.
Also can we have affixes for our rifts plz blizzard k-thanks.
Legion does seem to be okay we spent 3 years testing stuff in Diablo and now HERE IT IS.
While people complain about the balance of it.
Well just because a ting worked in D3 doesn't mean it works in WoW.
On the other hand.
This sounds fun ?
It beats 3 tiers of heroic oh you can beat tier 3. thats it then.
Nothing will ever change again you will now always crush that thing.
Its not endless endgame.
I agree it might not work but the reaction I often see is NO THESE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED IN RAIDING.
Let's work out how to make this fun.
But yeah it sounds pretty good.
Haven't done squats or deadlifts in over a month since I hurt my knee did DLs last night and still managed 4 @ 80kg \o/.
On saturday there was an eastern european guy who goes a lot just casually doing 110kg as if it wasn't even that hard _ and he's quite thin.
I hear my neighbour sensed I was finally about to fall asleep again and decided to brighten my morning with a concerto in Chainsaw.
Maybe he's making a drone.
MoonWolf what do you think about this Beamdog stuff.
The minsc line was a dumb meme don't care for it don't care they removed it. sort of dislike they look like they are caving to idiots on the internet.
For the trans stuff.
Nothing wrong with including it fuck the internet.
Hope they don't cave on it.
I thought they said they were going to flesh out the character more? and remove the 'ethics in adventuring' line.
We’ve received feedback around Mizhena a supporting character who reveals she is transgender. In retrospect it would have been better served if we had introduced a transgender character with more development. This is a lesson we will be carrying forward in our development as creators and we will be improving this character in a future update.
I hope that means we could have done this better and will do so in a patch.
And not we're going to bury it because GG hates us.
I think it means she'll get a quest.
Also i seriously don't get this anger over two lines in which a character mentioning they used to be a different gender but changed it through magic.
In bg1 we had an ogre carrying a cursed belt to change your gender nobody cared.
Once you've put the minsc line in you can't take it out.
In bg2 there was a plotpoint that a party wizard could get his gender switched against his will for laughs.
At best some trans people complained that this wasn't very nice and they were probably right about that.
But an npc that changed their gender becuase they wanted too.
You're surprised at this?
SJW's are ruining gaming.
Anathema no just annoyed.
GG are hate-fillled bigots how is that new?
Makes it sound like they are going to flesh her out or polygon editorialised it that way one of the two p.
That is also how I'm editorialising it v.
I really hope they do flesh her out.
What's her actual name MoonWolf.
Oh wait you posted it earlier.
Mostly I've seen people being angry over how hamfisted that was.
But hey what do I know I only follow shitlord sources like 4chan.
>complaining about hamfisted writing in Baldur's Gate.
It's a Bioware game man p.
It's a Beamdog game.
Anathema even by those standards.
Ok but the writing in the original is really hamfisted too.
I'll have you know Bioware games are practically poetry.
It's like poetry it rhymes.
And like everything else bioware touches dragon age keeps getting worse with time.
ChaosSmurf I've missed you 3.
Actually I don't know that I refused to touch 3 after 2.
GlennCuttlefish you're not missing much.
MMO-style grind in a single player game hooray.
I liked the first 40 hours.
Then I stopped playing it.
It kind of worked in Amalur. Kind of but then the combat system wasnt that clunky.
Better than The Witcher tho.
ChaosSmurf by the time I got to the castle I was basically done with it.
That is where I got to.
Enjoyed it up until then but then was like pfffff that's a big world.
Also I think something came out and it didn't run very well.
Want to go back to it but.
Think I'd rather replay all the Mass Effects than play DA3.
As much as I liked Cassandra and the cockney elf.
Cassandra not being a lesbian is the worst decision in videogames history.
Speaking of lesbians.
If they don't announce ME1-3 HD at E3.
I guess I'll replay them this winter.
I don't like how Fallout 4 gates perks behind levels.
Sounds like CLASSIC BETHESDA GARBAGE to me.
ChaosSmurf perks are modern bethseda garbage though.
So MoonWolf I finally found porings in ToS.
They are not cuddly and sweet.
Never talk about it again.
Yes well windows wont let you include in file names!
I have added a visio diagram into my word document will editing the source diagram automagically update the embedded rendering!?
What is even the point MS.
They're a little cute.
What is that GlennCuttlefish.
R slash wow in tracergate levels of meltdown over blizz issuing a cd order against a private server oh-ho man.
ChaosSmurf Tree of savior.
Well choices at any rate.
I know it might be too late but we have this thing called emulation these days.
Well your only option is to say which games you picked up so we can judge how good the choices were.
ChaosSmurf you guys pcgamesn really need a better format for pages like the new HS card expansion cards.
BwaS I did on twitter.
GlennCuttlefish not the saaaaame.
Okay I see now meh decent choices.
Meh? were you hoping I bought some bad games?
MoonWolf tbh I kinda like that one.
The League patch notes not so much.
Don't read that so i have no clue what it looks like.
I imagine the thin column isn't great for it though.
And I can't do much to make the layout look nice.
And it's kinda a wall of text.
What's wrong with the HS one though? I'd like to put explanation/detail on each but here's the cards go nuts works.
Don't suppose your site could support a second kind of extra wide page for certain articles.
Probably fucks to much with the takeover ads though.
ChaosSmurf too thin makes it hard to get a good overview.
We're only like halfway i and already you need to constantly scroll to cross reference.
Ah I didn't think about cross-referencing.
Tbh it's hard to display card images interestingly without transcribing the text to make them searchable.
ChaosSmurf or having a dedicated site for it i suppose.
And yeah I doubt wider site would be possible without pissing off the Men Who Pay.
Mythicspoiler.com isn't that easy to look around.
And its not like i need pcgamesn for my hearthstone cards still felt compelled to say so.
It exists to be googled as I'm sure you know.
Don't think it's actually worked out that well cause the name of the expac is so weird.
What we should have is just a page with the SEO new hearthstone cards.
Your site is 50% SEO and clickbait.
As i'm sure you know.
If you take out news posts it's more like 80%.
Hmm. A Nexus 7 pad for only 50eu. Tempting.
My 2012 Nexus 7 is close to unusuable for a lot of things and some apps wont install because it is too old.
No idea actually there's a 1st gen available as well for 45eu.
There's also this one for 30eu.
Bungo stray dogs turned out more promising than I expected.
Aww won the tavern brawl on turn 2 cos opponent rolled milhouse manastorm.
....and then played it////.
I uh... if you get millhouse you don't have to give your opponent a chance to empty their hand. Which that brawl is all about.
Well I drew it in a game earlier played it to be civil.
Think I won in the end.
North American video game publisher XSEED Games registered the FateExtella.com domain name on Wednesday.
Lorewalker cho is pretty ridic in this brawl too.
The most HS of card has been made.
This thing is mostly highlight fuel.
Yeah i got nothing.
If a card provides options such as Raven Idol or Wrath Yogg-Saron randomly selects one of those options when the spell is cast.
Now I am not saying that ToS has some baffling design choices.
But you can't queue in dungeon finder as group.
Thats some bad choices.
CORRECTION! Spells cast by Yogg-Saron will NOT buff Mana Wyrm interact with Antonidas trigger Flamewaker etc.
MoonWolf also RIP turn timer.
MairBear play control warrior its pretty heavy on the spells.
Oponent will probably die eventually becuase his board is wiped.
That or Yogg pulls out tree of life.
Or just heals the opponent and damages your own face.
Kiblers stream just went live with I believe in yogg-saron.
My fingers re cold and bloodless so i can't type well.
Get yourself a nice bug mug of hot tea.
I put them in warm water now they are weird and tingly.
I'll give it to those backstabbing ruskies they have a nice drinking culture with vodka.
Certainly compared to finnish drinking culture since the word culture does not enter into our drinking habits.
GlennCuttlefish is the Finn drinking culture not just in the darkness with a knife.
Oh no at times we go to a pub. in the darkness.
Two out of three!
Why would i want that blizzard.
MoonWolf guess we're not getting maddest bomber c.
It better be in there.
I hope Yogg-Saron can't cast fireballs at yourself.
In fact I hope it just can't cast buffs on enemies debuffs on friends.
Oh well unplayable.
It can cast anything on anything that thing cna target.
Card would actually be interesting with a couple of basic rules =/.
ChaosSmurf you know how MTG people keep talking about that Timmy/Johnny/Spike stuff.
It's spread to Hearthstone I noticed.
Hearthstone has prelaced Timmy with Highlight videos.
I mean the developers don't literally think about it that way.
But they make cards purely becuase it'll result in incredibly silly things.
Anyway i'm tempted to do a thing.
You can make timmy cards that appeal to spike.
Write a Yogg-Saron Simulator.
No I'm not talking this way.
You can make cards with cool flashy effects that appeal to Spike.
They are in fact the best cards.
In the old gods i'm pretty sure thats C'thun.
Sigh thinking about it by the time i'm done writing a Yogg simulator i'll have written half a hearthstone card effects engine.
So i guess thats not really a practical idea.
The fiend of a fousand faces.
Hmm there is not yet a Loken card...
I'm sure loken will show up if there is a titan flavoured expansion.
MoonWolf you'll get mad Reddit upvotes.
ChaosSmurf yes but it'll also take me a week or two.
I'll write a story about it.
Basically before i can build this and make it visual.
There will be literal videos of it.
Look at it this way.
Yogg-Saron is the MADDEST BOMBER.
No bomber will ever be as mad.
We have gone full inception now.
May you forever be plagued by rail replacement bus services May you constantly forget about your tea until it is unpleasantly tepid.
ChaosSmurf here is a thing someone took the cheap way out to a simulator.
MoonWolf naturall in my first roll of that.
DOOM! followed by Divine Favour.
Hopefully your not close to fatigue.
Oh sorry Nourish between Doom and Divine.
Better if it wasn't in warlock.
Think it is v. good.
Yeah that's an issue.
Warlock doesn't have very many big endgame bomb spells.
That are not... board wipes.
ChaosSmurf did you see the yogg simulator someone made because apparantly its okay if you just list x amunt of spells in a row ?
Are you mad v.
I got a few results that were actually pretty good.
There's a lot of spells that are just nerf your team buff my team.
Its also quite likely to wipe the board it feels.
Yeah rather disposing of your 7/5.
And suprisingly likely to put up secrets.
But most of those are not great.
It's an in-game way to get more than 5 secrets.
I don't think yogg will be competitive.
But i think you could do decent on the non tryhard bit of the ladder.
People didn't think elise woudl be.
He might just slip in as a win condition that you don't play if you're ahead.
That sometimes just oops-i-wins.
Looks like i'm loosing if i play yogg i might win or at least equilize.
So rolling the dice.
And if you hit board wipe before burn you're 50/50 to just kill them assuming lowish life totals.
Also i don't think Yogg can unplay himself.
He could hit sap right.
Its a battlecry battlecries resolve before dropping on the board.
Except battlecries that are self buffs.
And summon additional monsters.
I'm worried spreading madness is playable.
I sort of dismissed it as a horrible card.
Well if they have all dudes.
And you have all not dudes.
Or hope it just hits their face for the average of 5.
Wouldn't you prefer hellfire for a board or direct single remaval for 1 big thing ?
You'd play 4 hellfires tho.
This is HS we only have 30 card decks with 2 off limits.
Waht I'm saying is if you could you would play 3 hellfires.
You can't so play this worse hellfire.
I don't know i might be horribly wrong but i don't think its worth the risk.
I am in the worth testing camp.
Rather than madmans land.
I think Cho'Gall is legit excellent though.
Yes and it'll be great if i can get one as a priest.
I wonder how he interacts with Forbidden Shaping.
Does he kill you to summon something dumb like a 20 mana minion.
Or does he look at your remaining mana and take that in hp.
Just give us the damn expansion blizzard.
I can't believe the time it's taken.
That is a beholder having tea with a mimic. Or to put it another way a magical tea party. The beholder's name is Callie. the mimic's name is Mimi.
MoonWolf 21st is a Thursday.
Also I can't make the 20th.
This is what happens when i grab the new date after 12.
I don't think and just add 7 to the current date on my system clock thingy.
Also Fellowship being out makes me want to jump straight into a series of that after exalted >.>.
I need a fairly solid Overlord idea though.
There's always Deux minutes?!
Or was it douze?
Does anyone want a massive dropbox folder of Overwatch art?
Also MoonWolf no I didn't what are you talking about.
Valle finds out one of his chatmods was quitting matches to avoid rank loss.
Makes fun of the guy while watching videos of it.
Then makes him play a first to 5 to keep his twitch channel chat-mod status.
Oh yeah its great.
So far its 3-0.
Aight I don't have time to watch all that.
But that's stone great.
Thought you'd like it.
ChaosSmurf end result 5-0 AlphaBee took i think 2 rounds.
I hope it has a wee token that says YOU DIED.
Must have gotten delete.
Did PS read it when he left the note?
It just crashed for some reason though.
Anyway yes PatternSpider did do so.
But sadly it was just an image.
Which is now also deleted.
I suppose it would be.
Assuming it was a twitpic.
Having had a quick scroll down that user's timeline.
I'm going to pretend it was this Overwatch fanart.
That doesn't seem like anathema.
To link pics of tracers butt.
I'm going to Overwatch for half an hour or so before sorting out food and I can either stream it or sit on mumble.
Anyone have a preference and/or not want any association with me?
Can't talk right now my only USB cable is in use.
Noelor uhm sit in mumble ?
Hehe paladin in tavern brawl plays anyfin can happen at 10.
Yeah you do actually need to have some murlocs die for that.
Haha unstable portal spawned an ETC. One of my best draws so far.
Same game did give me a Rag and Nef though Rag barely lasted a turn.
Noelor sorry still eating.
Normal food takes ages to eat.
Should just consume nutrientpaste and corpsestarch.
Not enough protein sadly.
ChaosSmurf have you been writing on RPS again under a pseudonym? because.
MoonWolf you can get supernal MA without having MA merit in bonsai.
It can't do conditionals.
!hs Wisps of the Old Gods.
MoonWolf what about duplicate intamicies?
Minor The Scarlet Empress Joy The Scarlet Empress Remorseful Suprise.
Those are not duplicates.
Guess what word he started on there.
MoonWolf how do I enable a plugin in PS?
If it is the plugins folder you go to the config file you should see a section called ActivePlugins.
Add the name of the plugin to the list.
Oh I missed that.
I can't make it work.
You need to sort out your build actions.
Really need it to autosort those .dlls.
But i just never figure out how to do that.
Will look at that tomorrow.
Anathema i didn't mean just error.
I meant Build the damn thing.
Well you should have been more specific!
GlennCuttlefish you'll be happy to know today i just can't fucking roll dice.
Love the name v.
Both ships are named after two GCUs General Contact Units spaceships commanded by autonomous artificial intelligences that appear in The Player of Games a Culture novel by Iain M. Banks. Of course.
MoonWolf win a game for me o.
I know you weren't planning on winning.
I sh all win gaem for you.
So happy to! xD.
Said to me that I had 3 friends playing all of them were searching for opponent for over 10 mins.
!note anathema i made the mumble plugin create a config file if it does not exist. sorry if the code is not up to f# standards p.
!note anathema also build actions.
I'm sorry but i just can't accept pearl as sailor moon she isn't Dumb enough to be usagi.
MoonWolf ok I started on that last night but was too tried to think p.
Anathema well i'm not exactly good at f# so it might just be horrible i dunno.
Time to pack it up FO4 modding has no finished the game.
Cooked_Auto its So Immersive.
Shoulda done it as a PR and let me review it.
Anathema seriously i merged your pull request simply because then i'd have a working fromwork for try/catches.
I would have done the server properties on newlines and done them in an array instead of a list || is array but those aren't really worth changing it for.
Saving these last two panels for use at all times.
Finally the toilet paper is IMMERSIVE.
Do you know is NMM does the thing BOSS used to do yet?
Hehe latest tavern brawl strat drop manastorm to get opponent to burn portals and fill the board.
Next turn drop deathwing XD.
As though he has any control over his hand.
Srsly though that is a pretty nice play.
Noelor its not called esportal for nothing.
I /think/ I might have drawn DW on the same turn's worth of portal phase as MM.
Opponent did end up facelessly manipulating it while it was at half health when I was on lethal with no taunt opposition.
With me its Eliphas open a portal for each one.
Thats a little dramatic.
GlennCuttlefish Ace Attorney ep 2 is out apparently.
My biggest complaint with the AA animu is the music.
The intro at least.
Cooked_Auto very educational video i learned the sun is Hot As Fuck.
The plasma one gets better once he gets into how much energy is required to melt a supermutant.
I'm fine with the intro even if it doesn't fit. its just that they use either original music or some really weird variants for most situations.
Edgeworths VA is spot on imo.
Still glad they got at least examination and cornered in there.
Well it wouldnt be Phoenix Wright without it.
Did the movie have cornered?
Think so but I can't remember.
But then it also had a bunch of other things like people just falling off their seats and such.
That movie was weird.
That movie was perfect in a way because of that because it treated the movie as the game.
Apparently the movie did have cornered.
Yeah I'd be surprised if it didn't.
< presented w/o comment.
Hehe latest one had myself and a mage both esportaling our own nozdormu in separate plays.
Fun condition to play under.
Especially when 50% of the turn is taken up with just portal animations.
I completed the main story in fallout 4.
It isn't very good.
That does not suprise me.
Why does no-one use f4llout.
Because its no longer the 2010's.
Wait so what decade are we in?
Did the time machine work after all this... time? EUREKA.
MoonWolf odd cards today.
WISPS OF THE OLD GODS.
I wonder if that card is good.
Possibly in a dedicated token deck.
But only in its buff mode.
I'm not sure a 5/9 taunt shroud is the kind of SICK LEGENDARY I was hoping for.
I feel like it had more abilities at some point in development.
It probably had more attack.
I dunno there's bits of this set that really smell like ideas are thin on the ground.
Which is worrying given they're less than 2 years in.
But I'm sure people said the same about Chronicles in Magic.
To me it feels more like this set had lots of power during tested.
And then got tuned Way The Fuck Down.
Probably related to why its so late.
That would make sense.
Wonder if trigger can save anime again with Kiznaiver. First epiode wa interesting but not a over the top a I would have hoped. In fact it was quite down to earth.
Hopefully I get a decent amount of time with them at some point this year and I can ask about it.
That would be cool.
But i doubt you'll get a straight awnser.
I was surprised without straight Ben was about Warsong Commander.
They're more open than they used to be and the longer after something it is the more willing they are to talk about it.
Huh I missed the Cho'gall reveal.
Its a good card.
But hampered by being stuck in warlock.
Well japan is doing it again.
Doing what again ?
High school lolis in the navy stationed on a destroyer.
Which one's this one?
Well that escalated quickly.
I have not seen an anime escalate that rapidly in a while.
Start of episode Yay we are joining the navy.
End of episode We are mutineers from the navy.
Spoilers damnit you got the kancolle fan in me intrigued and was gonna check it out.
Still worth checking out.
I expect this is going to be a long ruse cruise if the first episode was like this. Also there are a lot of details left unexplained.
Docs got some good coat tech going on.
Nobody ever said darth vader didn't have style.
Hehe so Heroes in its big patch last week nerfed reworked a few heroes. Someone's found a bug that makes one of the reworked potentially quite OP.
Die in a certain manner easily orchestrated and you can chain cast w/o cooldown one of their most powerful spells on as many targets as your apm can provide.
Man this season is busy. Haven't checked out so many first episodes in a while.
Anyhow Flying witch is something I will keep following based on first episode.
Got to love that finish 5 tavern brawls quest luck.
Did two so far. That happened in one.
The other I never got anything over 3 mana./.
Nick's eyes make that.
MoonWolf bonsai just generated a Twilight with supernal larceny.
Is that bad ?
Well it's not a caste ability for twilight.
Oh i'll fix that later.
MoonWolf I beat someone.
Because they played fel reaver.
And then emptied their hand.
WHen I had jeeves on the board.
So Jeeves gave them 6 fatigue damage xD.
MoonWolf down to 3 hp but can clear enemies 2 minions and have a board of 6.
He draws Eadric the Pure...
1 off clearing his board. And his weakest minion has 3 attack.
MoonWolf are adjectives on familiars randomised?
I do not believe so.
Curious about an armoured fire-breathing ox.
The weird/complex ones are book examples.
Also just rolled on the same character a 3-dot familiar tyrant lizard and 2-dot familiar mule.
Got Chejop Kejak as two separate minor intimacies as well.
I fixed the problem with twiights for some reason i gave them larceny instead of linguistics.
Probably because larceny is cooler.
As for the duplicated intimacies thats not really fixable without redoing the whole system.
Which i do not feel like its worth it.
I have changed the weights of intimacies in general to just about half the chance for it to generate a specific existhing person.
So that should help.
But it won't solve it.
Reducing canon NPCs is better anyway imo.
Is my canon NPCs list is tiny.
And twitter is down.
Thats also a Real Problem.
Is that second thing really a problem?
I feel like it might not be.
1149 <- a reasonable question.
Fuck the undertones gimme the overtones.
Its especially fitting since i think thats a page from Citrus a comic that is alway sbarely just not gay things happening.
And relationships that are always just barely not being relationships becuase DRAMA.
Its the most infuriating kind of romance manga.
Clearly she failed in her mission to remove undertones.
TIL that a Japanese Carcassonne stream on twitch has almost 4800 viewers.
Correction Chinese Carcassonne stream.
Is that a spiky cricket bat attached to his wrist ?
That dumb sport with horses.
But polo seems more likely for Japan.
Also yeah that is 100% a Sailor Moon monster.
You can tell becuase its in sailor moon.
My guess is he was a national polo star who reminded Makoto of the senpai who broke her heart.
Then got transformed into a polo monster.
The evil faction in sailor moon operates on rita repulsa logic.
Just make an ever better monster!
It'll definitly work this time.
Souls fans are the worst.
Not _the_ worst but it is up there.
Certainly the worst hardcore playerbase.
Also Anyone who uses the phrase dark souls of genre deserves to be shot.
Roguelike fans are almost as bad.
Roguelike fans are like bees They will probably leave you alone if you dont go poking them.
Of course there are a few assholes who will sting you with their elitist bullshit anyway.
Also they're necessarily not congregated around a single game.
Also they like horrible games nobody enjoys playing.
Because they hate graphics.
Not all of them.
There are pretty roguelikes.
Noelor yeah but just anathema they're not proper roguelikes.
Cogmind is a pretty roguelike.
MoonWolf yeah but just anathema.
For todays dinner I improvised a casserole out of tuna pesto and feta.
On top of the mandatory pasta egg and milk combination.
Well yes but I meant more as frosting.
Or..whatever you call cheese melted on top.
Except different kind of pasta.
And tuna instead of beef.
For a meal born out of lack of planning and boredom of my usual meals turned out decent.
That's literally not what Souls Fatigue means.
Does it really mean being tired of the same old overrated games?
GlennCuttlefish any idea if you needed more viridian forest/ cinderlands transformation stones before I sell all these?
I can always farm more if I need some on alts.
Main character should be fine.
I think Pikachu is the only thing from Viridian Forest that evolves by stone.
Oops you're right it's Viridian Coast in this game.
Out of all the things Doom has been ported to you question this one?
GlennCuttlefish it actually does.
GlennCuttlefish it just seems even more like a recipe for nausea and headaches than the rest of VR.
One thing I kind of like in ToS is that it has bullshit grinding for trivial bonuses.
Noelor Sure. But its doom. Doom has been ported to everything.
<- they're made for eachother.
Even if there was no glass though D8.
MairBear the dumbest couple.
Oh no. Tavern brawl has ended. What shall I do.
Cry until Wednesday evening.
MairBear hearthpwn has a big no new information really QA session transcript up and notes down what outlet journalists asking question from next to their name.
Random questioners get where they asked the question.
So like Phil From Twitter Mostly.
So frodan got Frodan Reynad's Kitchen.
MoonWolf you may recall that when I was in Amsterdam I was vaguely fascinated by stickers on people's mailboxes to refuse junk mail.
We have those too!
I've been reading up on the situation in the UK because I get a lot of junk mail at my flat.
We as in my house.
Turns out employees of Royal Mail are contractually obliged to ignore any such stickers.
Fuck the royal mail TBH.
Say what you like about the Royal Mail at least they can actually find my house.
That is nice of them I suppose yes.
I'd rather they couldn't find my flat tbh.
My point being deliveries through any other source are always 3 days late. With 2 we couldn't find you emails etc.
Anyway turns out I can post a form to Royal Mail to stop un-addressed mail being delivered to my address from them.
Then email a different organisation to stop unsolicited mail addressed to me being delivered to my address.
And that'll cut my mail in half at most if I'm lucky.
Wish you could just get a sticker.
Noelor what about the random people who stick things in your box?
Play some of tis.
Ftrbzzs I see what you're doing on linked in endorsing me I know your plan |.
Mine didn 't crash nearly that much.
>sign-in forms that don't use the royal mail postcode finder to fill out the address.
MoonWolf can you do me a favour.
Send an email to mail@jcullen.me.
An r/pathofexile post in r/al.
Someone figured out how to get the goddess unleashed O.
I have no clue what that means.
Some guy paid $1000 to put a unique sword in called The Goddess Bound and then later another $1000 to put in The Goddess Bound which you could only get by a vendor recipe one of the items required being The Goddess Bound. In talisman league so november he paid another $1000 to put in The Goddess Unleashed and it has taken 7 months for people to work out the recipe.
Spoiler the weapons are shit.
Shit by choice of the creator btw.
So they're for transmogs ?
Not really worth the cost.
One of the ingredients is a 6l eternal sword.
Then i don't really get the point of them.
Apparantly it has voice acting.
MoonWolf the guy who made it isn't good at the game.
MoonWolf I got a picture of a plate of cookies with a note next to it saying sorry.
Article How to be a Good Wife.
Wikihow we got sexism DOWN.
It changes as you get older Noelor.
That just makes sense.
Purchase a noise cancellation device and arrange it in a comfortable position between the crack on your bottom and the seat of your trousers.
I did not expect this.
MoonWolf yeah that's the pic I got.
Oh shit I've reached hard mode.
That better be number 4.
And yes it was.
Very last pic.
Its suprising jus thow much of wikihow is horrible dating self help.
Throw a rock at them if they don't get angry. high.
If you have a boyfriend getting a kiss should be pretty easy.
For instance you could just ask for a kiss.
If you boyfriend refuses to kiss you when you ask in a reasonable situation you have relationship issues.
You don't need a guide.
You need to have a serious conversation and or get out of that relationship.
Noelor that seems pretty clear to me i don't know how you got that wrong.
Step 2 critical.
This one is fine if dumb until the point at which the people all look like Oblivion characters.
Thats what happens in F1 when you got dry tires and drive on very slick wet tarmack.
Roads get wet when it rains.
MoonWolf you should read the commentary on today's EGSNP.
I am almost certain I can theoretically win the best player in DBA.
I reckon GlennCuttlefish should be uh wossname.
My brain keeps coming up with Kamek but I know that's wrong.
Talking to coworker earlier about how I was planning to watch Jessica Jones and he didn't know what the deal was with her.
So I looked her up on wikipedia and just started reading directly from it.
She possesses superhuman strength... and is known to block mind control because of her strength.
I should be master roshi whatnow?
Also lost the second round |.
I love how my movie streaming plans get sort of foiled by the ESC.
Apparently not going to happen though.
What a sh ame.
No naked man singing with wolves.
Eurovision is really going downhill these days not allowing live wolves.
Among all the strobe lights and loud noises.
Terrible loss for art.
How does that foil your streaming?
It doesnt because the person in question got the dates mixed v.
Apparently she thought the final was this thursday.
Can't imagine it would be a schoolnight.
Maybe your national whatsit?
There is no holiday this thursday so.
Dunno doubt a Scot would want to watch that though.
Then yeah total date mixup.
Hitting them where it hurts right in the porn.
Ehh. not a fan of that decision on xhamsters part.
Also starting to suspect that Hundred will be the glorius trainwreck in this anime season.
0931 If things go well next week.
0931 if things don't go well 3 weeks.
0919 Do we know when 3e will be out?
MoonWolf you need a cult generator for bonsai.
You need a lot of cults in your life ?
I ran dark heresy and play WHFRP and Exalted ofc I need a lot of cults in my life!
I can give it a shot.
MoonWolf Look at the cult generator in DH2 Enemies Within.
Pretty sure it was in EW at least.
Page 127 or just click the hotlink in the index.
Oh well thats easier then finding atorrent. ty.
Hm sorely tempted to try to bid on this.
The leather padding in my headset is soft enough to not hurt my tender piercing \o/.
Anathema what did you pierce?
GlennCuttlefish animal shot-putting today? o.
MairBear got a thicker ring for my ear and re-opened the original piercing I think.
Anathema are you going to widen them up? 3-6mm rings?
Not planning on happy with the ones I just got for now.
Just got confused by the 'thicker ring'.
But I guess it's just the one after it's healed?
.8 -> 1.2 is quite a difference p.
I used to have 6mm metal spirals then one year I had such a high fever that I could not have any piercings on.
And I had to stop using thick earrings.
MairBear sure. When exactly today?
Ftrbzzs I think I'll go for more piercings instead of thicker loops.
Anathema more piercings also require less patience than thicker rings.
Yeah although I hear getting the top of your ear done is really sore because of the cartilage.
GlennCuttlefish due to my being a mair I won't be up -too- late today. So whenever really.
And then a further 10-20 for the game to actually finish it's bullshit? xD.
Oh yeah. better just start it up in the background and hope it doesn't fuck up my FPS too much.
MoonWolf Glenn and I are making bad puns.
You should be in mumble.
Should i really ?
{{ 'a'.constructor.prototype.charAt=.join eval'x=1} } }alert1//' }}.
Those medical forms teehee.
Can you get cancer from radiocative friends.
Oh is that what it says.
Also the blue poster is good.
Finally got the hearthstone mount for heroes. now I can stop playing this game D.
' I’m ashamed to say that at my worst I think maybe hardworking English-speaking families who voted for Cameron deserve what they get because they chose to believe a serial killer when he told them that they were his favourite.' Frankie Boyle is amazing.
'This is something that will happen forever which scientists now estimate might be as little as 30 or 40 years.'.
YES a good card.
If there ever was a case for proving that I dont really follow tumblr is that I just found out its supposed to support video links.
Which incidentally my browser doesn't.
Well guess who is cancelling this weekends exalted game If that runs on my computer.
..OR alternatively I could be retarded and typo the how name.
Goddamn S letter is dying.
Man this kiznaiver op raises the roof.
Interest in Wood Supply domain and/or timber business processes yes my hobby is timber supply.
Having an interest in getting wood can be very important.
Anathema so you're a fan of that new amazon engine thing.
Where they looked at Unity and decided they wanted in on that money.
Wtf why was my duck tape in the drawer I keep my dish towels and chopping boards in.
The secret is safe.
Do I hate myself enough to read this.
Probably. You've always been a glutton for punishment.
I read some of it it was awful.
Well yeah Scott Adams is an insuferable Ass.
*checks the SW notes on the roll20 page and sees that the GM has added notes about the NPC checks the link for the Sith we encountered* A righteous infliction of retribution manifested by an appropriate agent Oh boy. Oh booooy.
Cult i just generated Demonic Augury Through Multi Level Marketing.
MairBear i'm on ze mumble btw.
Thats my 5 wins for the morning.
Is he also power incarnate?
I think he might just be The Dragonlord.
Anyway i need one.
And then i need all the other legendary dragons.
So if you could just get me like 20 thousand dust.
If BGH killed it and it triggered duplicate would it play the 2 Deathwings? I'm assuming it would depending on play order but not sure how secrets and Death rattles interact.
....that would be fantastic.
That would be a thing.
Ftrbzzs I learned some geneva dramaz today.
MoonWolf you know that team is like dozens upon dozens of people right.
Two people leaving doesn't mean anything.
A while ago the lead in charge of UI and class design also left to antoher internal project.
Taking all your leads or seeing them leave.
Is not new content coming any moment now.
Pretty standard practice at Blizzard it's very difficult to move up from team lead.
They've been literally hiring for a new game for ages.
And they move people around especially to the WoW team during crunch time a lot.
Hmm yeah still think we're just going to have to wait 6 years for them to announce d4 or something.
Well you've convinced me it's news after I archived it without writing it earlier.
If I wasn't in a morning coma I would question if I should eve farm this thing.
Fortunately ToS is great for mindless farming in the morning.
It has a long legacy of mindess farming afterall.
Good gods after 2 mornings farming I finally got the thing.
Yay you got the thing.
And for that I get 18SP.
I'm not sure what the thing is.
But you sure got it.
Oh no. I hope there's a cure D.
My barbarian has 460 base.
I fear I will hate whoever came up with this collection thing.
In ToS every map has a hidden collection chest that unlocks the collection chest for that area. To complete it you need to collect various things that drop from the mobs in that map. At times common at times rare.
And when you complete it you get minor bonuse. Like in thi case 18SP on all of your characters.
Server wide I think.
May have to try this.
Well someone obviously liked inception.
Yeah but it fits with the character.
The Blizzard recruitment site uses commas as search indicators in the URL .
ChaosSmurf i think its just a very bad list system.
ChaosSmurf apparantly none of those are particularly critical.
Yeah that'd make sense.
Heh yeah I've always wondered about that.
Even if they are critical they still end up listed there for eons.
Wait its wednesday already?
Seems I lost a tuesday.
GlennCuttlefish you made puns with mairbear.
Oh I remember yesterday I just thought it was monday. Maybe I lost a monday instead?
This is good.
Weather isnt looking very pleasant for my race on saturday.
MoonWolf what level aren't we?
Def not level 5.
How many advances didn't we get?
MoonWolf I don't think I believe you.
See if you get any cool items.
Now recently there was an xcom 2 mod that let your party members like eachother and work better as a team.
And thats nice and all.
But waay to tame and normal.
So now there i Bonding and Time Travelers!
Where your soldiers can fall in love and then Future Shen will tend their grown up baby back in time!
Because we needed to be more fire emblem!
<- so this is what you guys look like right now.
Anathema aha team from work?
Only 4 this year.
Aiming to be #1 at the finish line?
Nah I'm doing it as a team this time.
So you're carrying someone else over the finish line?
Andy and Jaturong can't do the 12k or the 18k though so it will be just me and Claire Rosser...
What Marcelino not going?
Haha Marcelino do something that requires effort?
Wasn't he there last year?
I guess running professional services is too difficult to consider taking part in such out of office activities.
I can't actually remember why he isn't doing it this year but I'm pretty sure it was because it is too hard.
Too hard for mr. gym?
New goal be stronger than marcelino.
You weigh less than him you most likely have more muscle than him.
I dunno he looks pretty strong...
It's all just for show -.
Geoff looks strong when you know what martial arts he's done.
Don't want to get between his fist and the wall he punches.
Is punching the walls part of the training or just the result of dealing with fintrade devs?
He _did_ tell me he has punched a hole through a door before.
And I prevented him from doing exactly that once after a bad day in the office.
The amount of times I have to double check I get my right and left the right way around is worrying.
Eh I keep doing that as well. Have to double check myself if I get left or right correctly vOv.
Well that would explain why my winter coat was starting to get a bit warm out there.
Anathema hand trick is out I learned.
Left is the side where your hand makes an L if you stick your thumb out.
Okay GlennCuttlefish I do agree this HaiFuri could well have what it takes.
Garupan x kancolle ticking my boxes.
Your boxes are ruining anime.
Man saturdays are busy this season.
Theres like 5 shows I want to watch coming out on saturdays.
Aw yis someone made Linky work in newer version of FF.
I think I'd be okay with Steam's genre system.
If I could use it as a filter.
Hey Steam please never show me games tagged rogue-like.
Cooked_Auto I was asked to pick an actor to portray my druid in Dungeon World and decided they're CGI because they're constantly shape-shifting.
But then I decided to pick a VA.
And all I can think of is Tara Strong.
When they are humanoid they're usually a female halfling.
The real question is though Tara Strong as who?
Well thats cheating I.
I have countless animal forms all of which might have slightly different voices!
Also in the game?
MoonWolf I have time to go buy some solid food before game right?
Noelor so what's the thing that I do to my damage macros to level up the damage mod to ability + 2 D.
My attempts made it go from +7 to +36 somehow >.>.
Here's my current damage line for Ripping Vines.
Hit 5d6 +2*floor@{WIS}-10/2 +@{Implement} damage.
Let's try again! v.
I wonder if this one can be upgraded to 5.1 or higher.
I ate food now my stomach is rebellin.
So I managed to score the SW group 10 extra xp last night. Because the GM went 10 extra xp for anyone who finds me a Star Wars music playlist on Soudcloud and I found like 10 various lists but let me tell you the Soundcloud playlist display is awful.
And now for the not so fun part figuring out what needs to be included/excluded/refluffed v.
Lol can really tell it's hideaki anno.
MairBear and now my mage is shiny and golden.
And constantly being rained on.
MairBear i can't help it that just her golden portrait.
<-i kept waiting for the EVA to show up but they never did. worst movie.
Why do mage get such awesome things C.
Probably because i just got my mage to golden which means i least want to play mage right now.
Mage is my only 60.
Innervates out a blingtron.
He gets a 2/3 I get a gorehowl.
Today in funny accidental random cult names The Fan Community.
Because it named itsself after the leader.
Who had the probably chinesee last name Fan.
I have never felt such kinship with an animated plant before.
SunTiger MairBear will this do or do you want me to work on it later on?
That is amazing thank you.
Being my favourite - and objectively the best one fight me.
ChaosSmurf with the strong FF opinions.
Chaossmurf with shit opinions again.
Nah FF9 is one of my favorites. Not sure if it the best one but it competes for that spot with 7 and 6.
It was no 13.
It was no 10-2.
Also for Glenn.
She isn't shooting anyone or wearing cool future clothing.
The fuck is this.
This isn't hype at all.
She has the hair and what seems to be the leather jacket so plus points for that.
Call me when we have shots of her trying to rip the top off of a spider tank.
THe spiders..... tanktop? Dc.
GlennCuttlefish are you around by the by? For animal provocation?
Afraid not. Need to go buy beer and then I'll be playing ToS with friends until...8PM your time?
MairBear they fixed echoing ooze and brann.
Now you get three oozes.
Echoing ooze works a little weirdly.
Its battlecry actually sets a flag.
And then at the end of the turn if the flag is set it duplicates the ooze.
So brann set the flag twice but that doesn't Do anything.
They are fixing it so instead it actually duplicates twice when summoned with brann on the board.
I was thinking acidic swamp >.>'.
Well at least you've learned something.
MairBear if you have an an ios device AND want to spend 5 bucks.
You can now get Khadgar as a new HS Mage.
Do not has c.
>wearing shorts to work.
>server weather warning for East Midlands right now due to thunderstorm.
Guess I'm getting wet on my way home.
Useless phone did not mention this I specifically checked the weather today!
All the adult learning classes on offer this term are rubbish.
Apparantly fsharp core.dll is loaded on demand.
It was out of date.
Leaves in a huff.
Omghi sexy nerds <3.
Oh. Oh hi Smurf.
I'm bad at reading the user list.
I'm like.. the only E.
What more do you want.
Nothing it was clearly my own mistake.
A puppy would be nice though.
Good because you'll be getting nothing.
Omghi how is everyone.
Who is old/has kids/is married now.
What did I miss.
Noelor has their own place now?
...please say no one died.
ChaosSmurf is moving to bath.
Thats about it ?
Where does Noelor live now?
I can't keep track of cities and occupants anymore.
I forgot the name.
I don't even live there i can't remember place names.
I was thinking of visiting Edinburgh this year.
Some of you live there right.
I might just quit my job and do a Doom Tour 2016.
Don't... quit your job ?
Thats totally not worth it.
But I work in McD.
That would be terrible.
But I still want to do a Doomtour.
The travel itchies are real.
I'm going to walk a dog.
Edilith> Noelor moved like 5 miles across town area called Heaton.
'housewarming' was new years.
I.. didn't get invited.
We kinda went to the same schools as eachother.
Grmbl of course mairbears gone to bed.
No just mairing it up and going to bed at weird hours.
MoonWolf is there an error message?
No-one lives in edinburgh MoonWolf.
Except the lost and the damned.
But then that can be used to described most of Scotland anyway.
Anathema couldn't load assembly version number.
Anathema where is CS then atm ?
I need to GPS tag you all.
I can't keep scotish cities apart.
Edinburgh isnt even in Scotland!
Edilith you stopped being around when I invited people!
Capital of scotland not in scotland.
MoonWolf it's a fact.
It's fine it was jokes! Have you settled in Noelor? 3.
MoonWolf no joke when I started at Brady I didnt realise the principal tester was Scottish because he's from Edinburgh I thoguht he was from England.
I think that might make you double racist ?
I'm just really bad with accents.
I know that Noelor gesture XD.
Noelor has a great house I'm mega-jealous.
Anathema move to a place with actual decent prices then.
I hope you all took a group photo.
We are useless.
S/... shit!/yes definitely a thing we did.
Anathema> you're jealous of the place that gave you allergies?
BwaS not that bit the rest of it was pretty great though.
MoonWolf Fellowship is out so Gnome's working on a new game about Psychic wars in the year 201X.
Unsure if PbtA or not literally only heard that pitch.
There is never any f# jobs in glasgow.
'Annual subscription to the Guardian.' unusual employment benefit.
I just went out to take my recycling bin back in.
The bin men put it back where it was after emptying it.
As in so perfectly I thought for a moment it hadn't even been emptied.
Let's see if this still kills PatternSpider.
I deactivated the plugin.
I'll figure out what the deal is tomorrow.
Oh the FF9 steam port has some texture improvements.
Including fonts I guess?
And the entirety of Tetra Master looks like.
I'm assuming that I'm watching a stream of the port and not some modded rom.
Ok yes it is.
Man this is real pretty.
Wonder if it has frameskip or something.
To help with... being FF.
It has a fast forward mode.
And a no encounte rmode.
And cutscenes can be skipped.
Ok she'll be going for 100 nobles impressed so I guess that'll be a good time marker for going to bed.
100 nobles is not worth it.
She's using an Xbox controller and the port recognises that and says the relevant buttons.
But when it says press X she's pressing where that would be on the playstation.
Oh also the stream's fucked.
Anyway game looks cool.
I'm going from work to my folks' to Leeds tomorrow so see y'all Saturday night-ish.
Help it keeps happening.
My list of animes I follow this season just grew to...9?
Enjoy your No Free Time.
Oh I have free time. Except on saturdays.
Which is when 5 of the shows are released.
...Male character appeared. Time to drop this show.
MairBear it actually is.
It really is xD.
SunTiger shadow caster seems amazing.
Damnit hearthead be a little more flexible will you.
Yeah that seems pretty good.
Play a 1/1 rag.
SunTiger or Van Cleef.
Didn't think of that.
You only lose 1/1.
Or as someone pointed in discussion thread. Anub'ara.
Who will return to hand as an 8/4 for 9.
Look even that will not make anub Good.
They nerfed explosive sheep + seeds back to normal with this patch.
All the rogue things so far look amazing though.
Sure if you want to play control rogue.
I don't know what fixed it.
But its no longer broken.
Looks like i'm not allowed into the overwatch stresstest either.
Apparantly r/sweden defeated r/the_donald somehow.
How does a subreddit defeat another subreddit ?
Did they shitpost harder by some objective standard ?
Is there a jury ?
I dunno trying to read.
Wow FUCKING WOW.
That post is some condensed O_O.
ELEVEN YEARS IT TOOK THEM.
It took BIS Fifteen years to implement weapon switching on the move into their games v.
Anathema are you excited though ?
Not really since I don't plan on playing legion.
MairBear how do you feel about moving virtual fauna from point a to point B today?
I am all for it later but the way things are looking later might mean this afternoon. I'll get back to you on that though.
I'm around whenever though.
Well going to start the game up and make some coffee meanwhile.
Joining you once I get the game booted up. Tidying up a bit meanwhile.
*Logs onto alt first to _totally not do crafting_*.
A good catte.
Could you let Noelor know I might not be along for Fiascos this evening >.>'.
I forgot we were doing a thing and am awful at sleep.
Oh man Redeye doing next week's Heroes tourney in Leicester erm I think I may have to go to this.
MairBear its not happening i think.
<- annie trying to figure out if she loves anyone romantically.
Have to roll a d2.
Its been a while since I used PS as a dicebot p.
You can do things like straight up !d20 or !d6.
But there is only a few shortcuts like that.
D2 is not one.
Hm not the result I expected there.
Rolling a 4 from a d4?
Well rolling 1d4 for the number of siblings a character might have might not have been the best idea.
Take a minus 1 to account for option of only child?
I have set down a dark path and started watching shounen maid.
Pretty sure you've been lost and forsaken way before that point.
Truly. I've seen your MAL.
Bah second episode hasn't been subbed yet it seems.
I don't even have one.
Pretty sure I dont have one.
Theres like 15 people on my facebook list.
And two of them share a birthday.
Well it's like 23 you need for it to be 50/50.
I think I heard that statistic when I was 9 or something.
Didn't understand it then don't understand it now.
!note Noelor.
In last nights dream I learned that 1 Ghost nipples are hard to find 2 Nipple twisters work on ghosts 3 musical numbers are valid excorcism methods.
MairBear could you win a game for me ?
New Nier 2 footage by the looks of it.
The AI in Zone of the Ender is AMAZING.
Gig was very emotional many feels were felt _.
It was beautiful when everyone yelled along to the audio sample from Not For Want of Trying the first famous speech from Network.
Well its good you enjoyed it.
And then trying to get to my obstacle race half the trains in london were delayed or cancelled.
But I managed to get this tiny village in the middle of nowhere only to find that the taxi is booked up until after 4 my wave was 310.
After an hour of waiting I manage to get a ride with 6 women who are doing the race.
Because of the bad weather the day before the fields are really muddy and a lot of cars got stuck and had to be pulled out with tractors so there is a 2 mile long queue to get into the parking area. After waiting 30m in that we just left the taxi and walked and managed to get the 330 wave.
Didn't see my co-workers till after the race so I just went with the women I met and lifted them over the obstacles.
It was cold as fuck I couldnt feel my fingers for like 2 hours getting changed after was such a struggle.
And it felt nice after when all their families thanked me for helping them through it 3.
Was this just in the middle of bumfuck nowhere ?
Wow that really is just in the middle nowhere.
I failed the monkey bars again but almost got halfway this time but my hands and arms were just too cold _.
Managed to get one of the limited imperial space marine figures too.
There was reverse remote play I so I could send the video and sound from my vita to the ps3.
MairBear since my game has been cancelled should we do some fauna transportation today?
Wow I'm up pretty early.
Was expecting to be a corpse until at least the afternoon.
Starting the boot up process then.
MairBear nobody actually became a zombie yesterday.
Sorry I couldn't make it I just realised that I'd a broken my sleeping and b double booked myself to spend time with a friend over the night.
Oh I thought you were saying that you did Fiasco.
But just ended sans zombie.
Yesterday I was at a megagame in Leeds.
MairBear only 30 more wins for my golden hunter.
MoonWolf Warrior is still my closest.
Noelor did you become a zombie?
I just said nobody did!
They were just not any of the people playing.
I guess that means you won ?
Boy this blade and soul splash screen sure is nice.
I mean its not 10 minutes nice but.
Its all splashy and screeny.
MoonWolf technically as a member of the mayor's staff we lost because he got arrested and therefore probably wouldn't have been re-elected.
Btw for those that didn't see yet.
Is a thing now.
But I consider it a victory because his deputy had a strong chance of succeeding him.
And she was more cooperative.
Real time t urn timers true difficulty.
!note ChaosSmurf I unlocked Mei's epic Yay! emote =D.
MoonWolf turns out Overwatch has cheevos now and I hadn't noticed.
Did you get one ?
I have three now.
The first one I got was that pixel Mercy spray.
That I thought was for playtime but in fact was for Group Health Plan.
Restore 200 hp for 5 players without dying.
Time on objective 2.34.
Damn right I got gold and a card.
Congratulations to the Federal Government and National Guard for breaking The Hague Convention The Geneva Convention The Nurmeburg Protcols and the ban on weapons in space! so yesterday was an interesting game.
Ban on weapons in space <- the fuck did you do.
Plenty of ways to break that.
MoonWolf nothing to do with me!
I was in the city government.
It has all to do with you.
But what happened to break that.
I found out about all this stuff later.
Ok so we still don't really know what caused the zombies.
A thing that happened just before the zombies started showing up was that an unknown object crashed into the earth just outside of town.
Of course there are zombies.
And it turns out that it was a satellite.
And it turns out it had an experimental nuclear reactor in it.
And today I have learned it was some sort of weapon I guess.
Cant remember which X of the Living Dead that's from. Or which other zombie movie it was.
The game had a lot of things from various movies and TVs.
Cooked_Auto those Zelda pics are nice and all.
That is the Wrong Horse.
Well excuse me princess.
An endless fuck-wash cycle.
Noelor its pretty oglaf.
Update faster on sundays.
Its a very big taunt.
In the last session of Dungeon World we tried to shut down an old wizard's shop.
So she turned into a bear.
My druid was very upset because turning into a bear is Their Thing.
You can't monopolize bears noelor.
Sami became a bear and caved that wizard lady's bear-shaped skull in.
I am almost certain thats illegal.
In more ways than one.
Laws don't apply to bears.
Also we burned the shop down when we left.
Not even animal cruelty laws?
Just to be sure.
Adding arson to the list.
I visited a zoo near the beginning of the session.
It was a nice zoo but I still led the local deer herd on a minor stampede out of their enclosure.
And into a bakery.
I get experience for destroying symbols of civilisation.
Noelor> was this your wknd in Leeds with unspecified and unspecified?
Yeah she was cool and he has change 0% other than now being a doctor.
Also he did not recognise me at all literally Do I know you from somewhere?
Tbh you have changed your hair and your face a bit.
Oh wait that's the entire thing. Didn't realize that.
Wow this is good. Really good.
Was nice and sunny an hour ago now cloudy and dark.
Anathema cloudy and rainy here too works wonders for pollen and street dust!
Oh yeah I could feel my nose tingling this morning tree outside my house is in full bloom.
Yeah fucken trees thinking they own the place.
Jizzing all over the air.
Ftrbzzs did I mention that the weekend after I get back from visiting you I have to do a 12k obstacle course?
In Dangonronpa two characters have a sauna competition.
They clearly haven't heard the joke about the Finn and the Russian who went to the sauna and had a competition.
Did they both die from heat exhaustion?
No just the Russian.
Because he used painkillers to ease the pain.
Which meant he was in too long and died.
And this is why they don't host the sauna competition anymore -.
He died because he took painkillers hahaha.
And this is why finns dont usually tell jokes.
Yeah the joke goes 'a Finn and a Russian went to a sauna the Russian died'.
I think it's great 8-.
GlennCuttlefish its for the best.
Guess I'll stick to terrible puns instead.
Please don't do that either.
It's only a problem if you see me irl don't worry.
But at what cost.
I enjoy bad puns though.
Anathema this is terrible.
That used to be my favourite anime D.
I meant the jokes.
I liked the jokes though p.
I am easily amused.
The Reverend has recently forbidden Lambs of Batsarisakis to no longer feel pain <- sometimes random generators do weird things.
Some say random other say fantastic.
MoonWolf is that from bonsai?
I've been working on this cult thing.
But generating beliefs is non trivial.
So is thinking of hundreds of weird things cult leaders and members do / are.
Read the old testament.
Man I need a coffee today.
I had more christian stuff in there for a while but then generic-ised it yesterday to make it more generally applicable.
Anathema I've got some good stuff I brewed just earlier.
So while you'll probably won't want to put Practical Universal Supremacy Today! or Test Driven Feminine Excellence into say creation.
In general it shouldn't generate stuff that definitly only fits on modern earth.
Anathema What do you think 16gb or 32gb Nexus 7?
Tracer to be OP in HotS this week.
Well at least she a manaless hero.
MoonWolf she looks broken.
Cooked_Auto I have 16gb and haven't had storage issues but I don't use it for much.
Yeah my Nexus 4 is 16gb as well and I still have 5 gigs free with a bunch of music and podcasts on it.
Mostly going to use it for PDFs so 16gb shouldn't be much of an issue. My PDF RPG book collection isnt more than 6 gigs anyway v.
32gb storage feels a bit like overkill.
Besides I have like £20 off the price.
Well remember to include apps and the OS.
Ah well I don't plan to cram tv-series into the things and I won't really have all 6 gigs of pdfs in it and mostly my painting guides so it'll be fine.
They've started adding photos from the race!
Anathema its not done yet but here is a thing.
'The Preacher can talk to trees knows every language and is a changeling.'.
'Recruits that thought The Preacher can cast out demons are sorely disapointed by reality.'.
Sometimes its also just terrible.
As some combination of things i didn't think about utterly breaks grammar.
Or really long cult names get repeated over and over.
'Congregation of 7 Sins believe in Virtue Prophecies'.
Anathema sure they just don't follow them.
A bit like how satanists are technically christians/an abrahamic religion.
'While recruits are told as Initiates of Spirelis Chopin they hold interal e-sports tournaments this never happens.'.
There is a bunch of really mundane ones in there because its funny as hell.
Cult name' Better Living Through Sexual Excellence'.
Like prepare food or sell flowers.
Anathema there is also Test Driven x and Agile Development with x.
Dammit Mair I don't have time to get back into CK2 p.
Thats fine the stories of what happens are better than the game anyway.
Sort of like EVE that way.
It was quite fun.
Just dat learning curve.
Chosen Ones of 19 Angels believe in Feminine Climax <- this cult just believes in Female Orgasm. Also their leader The CEO can be in multiple places at once.
Thats it all the rest of the things it generated were mundane.
Like studying religious texts and shaving their heads.
Well that#s an opening hand.
MairBear sure is agro.
Enemy on 5 h.
Arcanite reaper in hand.
His shredder pops out annoy-o-tron.
I can hear Savjz exact tone too.
Forsen of Nature especially.
I'm a big fan of Frogan.
Il-sung manipulates their closests followers to do their every bidding which is why Members of The Besson Community believe General Il-sung can be in multiple places at once.
Fuck trees my nose feels awful.
Had no idea you were into dryads suddenly.
Dryad humping is the leading cause for sudden onsets of hayfever.
And splinters in places where you shouldn't really have splinters.
Like New Yorks sewage system.
Oh a turtle joke.
Sorry that took a while to process.
I'm not I am just highlightning the risk that may come with sexual congress with a dryad. Obviously it all depends on the type of dryad that may be involved.
The shit I do to taunt streamers.
I was bored so I made this.
MairBear if ou wanted WAY TO MUCH INFORMATION about season 6 d3.
Just release daye pls.
Noelor Bookmark this for later.
MairBear TIL the HS innkeeper has a fucking Name.
Brew is not a traditional dwarven second name bit.
Think it kinda is.
But I'm not gonna go tour dun morogh to give you a headcount.
Conveying the right words through communication is difficult.
Anagnostopoulos Zafiropoulou MoonWolf did you steal Roll20's name generation?
Nah I'm kidding it's just Greek I think.
You did hit on a particularly ... greeky ? one.
Movement for Singular Creation and Philosophical Benevolence Believe in Singular Creation you don't say.
So i assign every cult a single main Vague Belief.
Some of them have it in the title.
Sometimes the beliefs section mentions what it is.
Minister Anagnostopoulos Zafiropoulou has recently forbidden Operators of Movement for Singular Creation and Philosophical Benevolence to avoid physical contant contact? constant?
This sometimes leads to that.
Also forbidden to avoid.
Yeah i initially made a list of things cult members do.
Then added a the sentence where they were forbidden to do them.
This works... most of the time.
Anagnostopoulos used to be a religous offical wait what.
What is he now.
As in some established church of seen as legitimate group.
I can revise it.
I think ...used to be a of another religion?
When fully initiated into The Chidera Tribe it is finally revealed to True Believers that Self Accomplishment is only the first step on the path to Magnetic Reformation wait what.
I'll do it right after i finish this thing to put things in proper Sentence casing.
I was with you until that second-to-last word bonsai.
Chairman Maragelou doesn't see race' there is either a missing or extraneous ' here.
Luitenant look MoonWolf I know you don't like that word.
But you have google.
Preacher Wenhua Boulet on all levels except physical is a wolf and was born on mars this is fully half this religion's beliefs.
You have a problem with the wolf therian from mars cult ?
I very much do not.
Only 1 week of Overwatch beta left.
MoonWolf did you get in yet?
Open beta is may.
Well i have not checked today but my mail was empty and i didn't get into the stresstest.
Well now here's a funny coincidence.
Newcastle City Council make their emails about paying council tax really scary.
And make tracking your tax payments online really awkward!
Battlenet friend allegedly hanging out in HS main menu for -1 minute.
I think they meant <1 But missed.
Sure let's go with that.
I still greatly recommend the Legally Blonde musical btw.
Well that sucks Rat Queens has been put on hiatus it seems.
Nobody beat their spouse up this time at least right?
Not that I know.
Meanwhile in Gunnerkrigg Coyote clarifies Friday's chapter title page.
Updated Bonsai cults.
They now do stuff sometimes.
Once a week sacrifice a pig.
Bi-daily sacrifice a sheep.
Thats a lot of animals.
Twice each century sell lottery tickets door to door. <- not a popular activity.
Quarterly lie to their parents. =3.
The Leader has no shadow and no longer has a heartbeat. oh dear.
Yeah there is a bunch in there that basically come down to might be a vampire.
Noelor also your feedback has been incorporated.
So no longer will a certain dumb military rank be misspelled.
Every so often pretend to be happy.
Leader Osborn once came in 38-under par in golf with 11 holes in one. yay.
Life is hard in the Communion of 12 Rightfull Actions and 5 Gods.
Noelor that one is from weird claims about kim jong-il section.
Members of The Chimenes Tribe study popular culture. secretly just a cult of nerds.
Chimenes Osborn mandated Lambs of Leader Chimenes Osborn to never wear red ummm.
Thats technically a sentence!
Lambs believe that Leader Chimenes disproved the Riemann hypothesis =0.
Not a very good one mostly my fault.
Once a day recruit new members. fair.
It's like telephone salesmen but worse.
Voices of Agile Development with Galactic Gospel believe that Ruby holds 4 seperate scientific degrees. Members of Agile Development with Galactic Gospel cannot lie this one is just one long programmers' joke.
I can't help it ?
Once each decade train in pyromancy. that seems insufficient.
What do you know you're no pyromancer.
Well for comparison Weekly train in nekomancy.
Thats just cult talk for going out and petting cats at the shelter.
Why did you decide to include e-sports anyway?
I like that in between a list of weird creepy or magic things.
Suddenly its play darts every week.
Just I thought you'd tried to avoid modern stuff.
Yeah but i have a few very modern possible cult names.
So i included a few modern joke things.
I intentionally divored it from christianity because there used to be a lot of possibiities related to that.
And tied it to much to just earth.
Now the most christian thing is the word Messiah.
Which can be considered in other contexts.
WoW - Legion is going to be out in August.
Blizzard continues to disapoint with its wow expansion release times.
Disappoint too soon or too late?
August is pretty far off with no content inbetween if anything.
14 months I think I saw?
Every expansion is we're going to be improving the rate at which we produce content every expansion takes forever to come out after the final content update for the current one.
Bryan Lu has recently forbidden Members of Congregation of 4 Tablets to no longer need food. no becoming vampire for you Members!
Well I know what I'll hopefully be playing in august.
Stop not eating its creepy!
Glenn better start saving couch money.
C_A yeah deus ex will probably require a better computer than what I have.
!note MairBear you should like these they're mostly puns.
General Lu has over 200 patentend inventions p sure this should be has patented...
Going to have to explain that one to me.
No he just really likes fax machines.
Otherwise it's just owns a bunch of stuff.
He has inventions that he has patented ?
Am i missing something ?
Ok so in the sentence Has 200 patented inventions patented becomes an adjective.
The inventions have the property of being patented.
In the sentence Has patented 200 inventions patented is a verb.
The cult leader has done the patenting.
Okay i have changed it.
To me it still doesn't.. really seem like it should work that way.
Oh the other possibility is uh.
Biennially misunderstand Gematria. ok...
3 episodes in MC finally realized his roommate was a woman.
Either lechers or as thick as dense as fucking diamonds.
Meanwhile in Exalted Final-Princess Wolf.
Quick check before I go to bed and switch off my PC until probably Friday.
For a dense anime protagonist this moved rather fast. 3 kissus this episode.
Who's up for Fiasco this friday?
She must have really disapointed her lunar parents.
Going to assume Mair if he's awake.
Let anathema know when he's around.
MairBear who's up for Fiasco this friday?
!note Re Fiasco Probably!
!note Minister Re Fiasco Probably!
MoonWolf all these threads for the cards.
Dies to BGH. Literally unplayable.
Game won't even let you put it in a deck.
RE Quest giver Interesting interaction with Reno - Dies to BGH... etc.
Can't do fiasco playing Hero Quest.
Nuclear catastrophe better for wildlife than having to live amongst civilized humans people are the worst.
!note Minister can't do fiasco playing Hero Quest.
Rank5 wolf? O <- face hunter is pretty good.
Its fine i only need 11 more wins.
Morning oh fishy one.
Boars are a pest.
Why did I have breakfast at home this morning big mistake D.
Anathema why a mistake?
Well there went my compelling statistics.
Now its only 3/8 agree breakfast was a mistake.
Cycling directly after eating == nauseous Ana.
Anathema that's why I just don't have any breakfast or wake up early enough not to feel horrible.
Wait its tuesday? How do I keep missing mondays.
Almost Friday almost holiday!
Its not almost friday ftrbzzs.
If it's not Monday it's almost Friday.
Well you could say its a mini-friday today because wednesdays is a mini-saturday.
Went to get a coffee lazy today so used the machine two people talking but can't really hear over the grinder as I leave one of them is talking about how autistic people are emotionally dead inside |.
Anathema hope you pushed their heads to the coffee grinder blades?
Sorry I bring shame to my family.
Was too shocked to do anything but leave.
But think about a cylinder viewed from different angles. It's not very hard to visualise that is it? artists should check their imagination privileges tbh.
GlennCuttlefish just imagine a stop sign that's blue and cylindrical.
I can imagine one but I can't visualize it in my head.
Which in this case would have been contradictory I guess? The idea didn't seem absurd until I started thinking about it.
Are we in BST atm?
We went over to summertime last month at least.
Oh we are so we aren't on UTC atm.
So I shared a link on Facebook to a primer on modern gender vocab.
Minister how'd that work out ?
1st response from a 50-something-year-old cislady ...a bit angry and preachy.
Fuuck you lady.
I'm here like please continue to feed into the stereotype.
The page in question.
ITC today people are awful.
But that is every day.
Where once it was Captain Hans Oberwalt of Reikland leading an expedition into the woods to deal with a beastman warband growing out of control we have Extrimis Lord Celestant Korlagan Stormhammer forming from lighting onto the blood plains of the realm of the gore to do battle with Blood Lord Skullanger and his discontentmongers and capture the inter dimensional gate to the realm of the everblooming woods.
Anathema orruks orks wasn't trademarkable enough also we made them more 40k because reasons.
Another picture \o/.
I can still make out your skin not enough mud.
That was right after a swimming bit.
Is that muddy enough for you?
I was disappointed to find out last night that no one has bothered ripping the HOTS music the other HOTS beyond an early Alpha from like 2014.
Troll'd someone was going on about how the 'Remain in the EU' group lack passion and how the passionate leavers will be more likely to vote got him to be quiet with a people said the same for the Yes group on the independance referendum and we still lost.
I did a council vote in disgaea 5.
Now my base is filled with odd looking grey bunny things.
Something like that.
MairBear try p unching them ?
Cannot punch in base C.
Enjoy your bunnies then i suppose.
You must have wanted them.
Otherwise why did you ask the council for some.
Cos the bill said something about adding Lucky Boards to the base.
Apparently they are a lucky board.
The new warship anime High School Fleet has the best scripts.
Don't put me in the same boat as you!
And by best you mean terrible right ?
Just a matter of how you see it.
Wow that video is proof that Guile's theme goes with everything.
Did guile somehow get even more buff ?
Official pdf release now allegedly tomorrow.
They're at it again.
It looks cool D.
Also that music is On Point.
In case someone hasnt seen it yet.
Huh an actual charactr trailer for once.
They've been deficient for a while.
I apreciate japans willingness to inovate on the pillow technology.
MairBear they confirmed WOG will be out 26th.
So tired last night I went to bed straight after getting home S.
More like lack of sleep on sunday and monday WHFRP group didn#t finish until after 10.
I sat up to 5 playing Star Wars v.
Helluva fun though. Went through two more fights without taking a scratch and just strolled in and stunned one guy with one shot while everybody else just kept failing so hard that the guy got upgraded from mook to adversary by the GM.
So for a while the other flailed in melee with a naked and psyhotic Weequay in a blood splattered room among a bunch of dead working girls until my character steps inside and just puts a stun bolt into his chest.
Then the Sith Pureblood proceeded to murder all the guards and patrons in the strip club we were out and earned a dark side point for it.
So no game today SunTiger ?
I said this last week as well.
Because noelor doesn't have the time.
You assume I remember what happened last week.
Well guess I will go for plan B then Dangit ronpaul 2 Island escapades.
Even more murder ?
I will be sorely disappointed if there isn't.
Do you ever get the option to be the murderer in those games ?
Well you didn't in first one and I never touched any of the others until now.
GlennCuttlefish if you spoil it I will hunt you down when I am in Finland and go Monokuma on you |.
Anathema you already promised to stab me. You are not selling this very well.
Which reminds me do you know exact dates yet?
He'll stab you twice ?
25th June -> 2nd July.
Dunno how much of that time will be in / near Helsinki though?
All I've planned is the flights the rest is up to ftrbzzs.
Anathema some days in the south some days by the lake.
You assume I remember what happened last week <-- and here I said to someone I was gonna be busy tonight too...
And that's -after- I checked the topic for what level we were >.>'.
Somehow missed the difference of date.
Everything abuot this is terrible.
Somehow missed the difference of date <- i changed it before OTS last week and i said it at thend of the session and i don't know how to communiate this more clearly.
Unlesss i send everyone fucking daily reminders.
I'm not normally bad at remembering when we're not doing it xD.
A reaction for you to any puns we make SunTiger.
Just imagine me sighing forever.
Someone ended up teaching their do to recognize when HS matches are over.
Someone just asked me if I ever eat solid food because she only ever sees me have Bertrand or tea/coffee p.
So you told her very rarely.
Everyday is not very rarely.
MairBear that person just had a bad day.
Prophet Olufunmilola posseses the blood of kings and does not die if they are killed. <- great it generated a Highlander Immortal.
That's enough imgur for one day.
So I went to the gym this morning right and this morning I thought well I haven't eaten since 4 yesterday so I guess I try out this pre-workout pouch I got in a magazine. Not sure I liked it skin was all weird and tingly for an hour left leg was shaking when I was squating not sure how much caffeine was in that thing... would not recommend.
Thats not supposed to happen when you eat food.
It was a powder you mix in water.
OTOH I've lost like half a kilo since last Wednesday!
You don't look like you need to loose any weight at all honestly.
Probably not but I'm vain and want to have visible abs at least once in my life _.
BMI also says I'm overweight I think not that BMI is reliable! p.
Well there certainly is a lot more fanservice in dangit ronpaul 2.
Even more than before ?
Wait was there a lot of fanservice in DR1?
I can't remember any but maybe I just conveniently forgot.
I hate every one of those colour names.
You can just have a fucking colour.
You don't have to namy it after a thing in the game.
Well trademarking in this case.
Not everyone can be Vallejo and just call their stuff x colour.
You can't trademark a colour.
SunTiger they would have to come up with different names anyway since they are slightly different shades.
To be fair its the name not the colour that is trademarked alongside the specific tone and hue of it.
Also Im pretty sure you can do that.
'blood red' 'ok but whose blood red? they aren't the same' 'dunno' D.
Not to mention they've changed suppliers at least a couple of times.
That's really the biggest reason because that practically forces them to rebrand their stuff.
Yeah but Mortarion Green.
It's interesting to note that while GWs lineout of paints is maybe some of the smallest in the business their support structure around it is some of the best.
Anathema Type B anemic blood red just didn't sound catchy.
Force of nature no longer charge don't die.
Bgh now a 5 drop.
Blade flurr is now a 4 cost spell.
Because Fuck Rogues i guess ?
Leper gnome now a 1/1 ded card.
Arcane golem... now has no charge and 4 hp.
3 mana 4/4 is not worth giving my opponent a mana crystal blizzard.
Lol molten golem is now also dead.
Maybe at 6 mana ?
MairBear i like how they nerfed handlock because...
What was wrong with handlock again ?
Seriously did anyone think molten giant was a problem. ever ?
I don't like the BGH nerf.
Because i feel it doesn't actually solve it.
SunTiger looks like i picked a bad day to watch streamers.
*Assumes they'll all be going on about it* xD.
SunTiger ....wanna know the brawl? >.>.
Nothing but raven idols.
That BGH buff is exactly what effigy mage needed!
SunTiger am eating fried fish broccoli parsnip and raddishes for dinner. fuck youuuu.
I guess thats a meal.
Shame it includes broccoli.
I echo... u wot m8?
Broccoli is a terrible vegetable.
Especially with garlic mmm.
You two were made for each other it seems.
Anathema the final exalted pdf is up on drivethru rpg now.
The download speed is atricious.
I may wait for my dead tree copy.
SunTiger you don't like puns.
You don't like broccoli.
What do you even.
What do i even?
That's what I wanna know.
*swearing at tavern brawl intensifies*.
Why is it an hour later once more?!
Because e urope doesn't get tavernbrawl on wednesday anymore.
TIme to watch moonwolf get !%$'d by RNG.
We get it whenever the fuck blizz feels like it.
That was my daily though.
MairBear i challenge you.
To a good brawl.
Only commons in decks.
If you accept get on mumble.
Surely pauper would be only basics.
Or even w/o the class cards unlocked w/ lvl up.
BwaS not a lot of deck building options in only basics.
...that's not much of a limitation for rogue.
*ditches rogue picks another class*.
Ok I lied I am totes downloading it.
Anathema i don't like that they just kept that cover.
I hoped that was not the final cover.
I hope the actual book says Exalted instead of just Ex3.
I love the moments when crunchyroll lags out and stutters up and you realise it's not the show pausing for dramatic effect.
Anathema good news. chompy the lunar is still in with new/better art.
!note MairBear These priest nerfs are indefensible Playing with my opponents deck particularly druids has never been worse.
You know I dont think the cast of DR1 was quite this...broken.
I have not played/read/watched that.
But i thought they were pretty fucked in the head already.
From what I remember of 1 they had issues but mostly they weren't this insane.
Raven idol drawing the summoning stone is quite hilarious.
BwaS this brawl takes FOREVER.
In a RvR opponent conveniently stacked up alex a molten giant and another molten giant following doing mostly nothing.
If any of you have like a 5 yo niece with a birthday coming up ...
A normal knight is £90 and this £120 box includes 2 + terrain o_.
I like this first reply.
Yeha DTRPG can just shove things into your dropbox.
Basically stealing their bandwith.
It snot like dropbox has to actually get the file individually for each account it just stores the one unique copy.
>60 minutes is not 1 hour.
SunTiger but the files are watermarked so it would have to download each one?
Technically it switches to hour on 61 minutes.
Are you upset ?
Thanks body I sure did want to wake up after 6½ hours again.
Glenn's getting what he wants!
Mair I was being sarcastic. please mair I dont need this now. Mair please.
I think today I will go out on a quest.
A quest to find yet another copy of DoA4.
Why do you need another ?
Well the previous one died years ago.
And I have had DoA5 on PS3 for a while.
But now my PS3 died so I need a copy of DOA for xbox 360.
Can probably find a cheap copy of whatever finland has for a national second hand market website.
Well I can get a second hand copy of DoA4 for 7euros.
If I could find a copy of DoA5U for cheap on 360 I might go for that instead but only copy I can find of that is a new copy for 55e.
I can get a copy of last round for 30e.
Which came after DoA5u.
Guess I'll ask the friend I usually play these which version he would prefer. Personally I would like to get 4 again since its cheapest and has my third favorite character in the franchise.
GlennCuttlefish I'd give you min.
My brother bought it when he was over and I'm not like to use it much D.
Sadly I suspect the postage fees will be enough that it will be cheaper to find one locally.
I am wondering about localization for this one character in DR2.
But I know that if I look it up I will be spoiled to hell somehow.
That can't be a pleasant experience.
Imagine having that eye open.
Thats about it I guess?
Out of the blue I am being asked to help with...Physics homework for my cousin? What? Why? I was never any good at anything relating to physics.
You know the relative strength needed for bear lifting though.
So our local overworked postal service who keeps letting more and more people go are now offering a new highly demanded service to their customers Lawn mowing.
You sure they are overworked ?
Sounds like they are desperate for work to me.
No they are overworked.
I know a few current and ex postmen.
Why is there an english version.
Why wouldn't there be.
Its a page advertising lawn mowing by finish postal workers.
This is one of those real life if it wasn't for my horse moments.
No magic i guess.
Give me a Cyberpulp game any day.
MairBear rageorc upgraded his punch.
Had quite the dickish play in that last brawl.
Mage drew sorc apprentice and mana wyrm spam'd the shit out of it poly'd his molten giant.
MairBear nobody plays around the 10 upgraded druid hero powers from a mage.
I mean it would have still been 20 damage right?
Blizzards reveal livestream thing.
Frodan is a tiny tiny man.
I'm going to be on mumble if anyone wants to discuss dank HS memes.
Ooh new discover cards.
I love using another emote sarcasticly.
What if I dont want to discuss dank memes.
You can still be there ?
I might even do that if I can find my second USB cable.
What emote are we getting?
Replacing Sorry with Wow.
!note MairBear right after you left opponent dropped 38/38 c'thun.
19k gold... spend it you pussy!
And I've been spending all my G on the soon to be fucking off GVG boosters...
I spy with my little eye someone who probably didn't play WoW to learn how all these mobs were pronounced.
Oh gods malkorok what a fucking bitch of a bossfight in siege.
Oh great because we needed to get more c'thuns.
First world champion... gets a 1-drop common in honour XD.
BwaS well if you're going to get a card.
You either want a common low mana.
Or a big massive high mana.
One gets played a lot by everyone.
The other is really impressive.
Middle of the road is just meh.
Look at that taunt slime.
I love that taunt slime.
Hmm that tentacle one would be hilarious played T8 on as first card played.
Annoyotron slaaneshi noise marine oh yes.
Evidence X didn't look like that Evidence X has details like that fuck you game thats the second time you throw a curveball at me in this case.
Silver hand murloc is amazing.
Goddamnit game not again.
I see nothing wrong in this.
Even if I usually drink it.
But only because its the cheapest now!
Holy balls my arms hurt.
I woke up in time to have breakfast AND grind coffee today.
But...isn't coffee the entirety of breakfast?
Coffee doesn't build muscles so no!
GlennCuttlefish the Finnish breakfast maybe.
Like mine this morning.
Anathema try drinking more of it.
Maybe that'll do it.
Oh I didn't have the coffee yet waiting for my coworker to arrive.
I had tea in the morning.
I am Scottish after all.
Have coffee are you satisfied now?
I don't even like coffee.
You sound like anathema did ~15 years ago 8-.
'ugh I don't like coffee I use instand and use milk sugar to make it taste right'.
Then the magical world of coffee opened for anathema when I made him some proper coffee.
And the rest is history.
I never used sugar.
Ftrbzzs i never drink coffee.
I don't put anything in coffee because i don't .. .drink coffee.
I'll drink coffee if i can't get tea hot chocolate or soup and its cold enough i need a hot drink.
Otherwise there is always just water.
If you're at the stage where you are putting caffeine in your butt you have issues.
And should probably see a doctor.
Whats wrong with instant milk and sugar?
1 it's not proper coffee 2 it tastes like shit.
SunTiger I don't know the details but Ironicus runs 13A with some house rule on levelling up that had allowed the party's wizard to have 24 int at level 8.
Thats ... some house rules alright.
This makes Force Salvo VERY GOOD.
Well if you want to end a fight with 8 opponents quick.
This makes Force Salvo VERY GOOD <- oh yes because it was just... so weak before.
Are we doing fiasco tonight Minister ?
SunTiger can we not have Reno anymore pls? ._.
We are having reno for 2 years.
Well a year and a half.
SunTiger Pyrion Flax is doing HS now?
THat was my response to that card drawing.
MairBear good for Exasco tonight?
We have at least 4 which is the minimum size.
I'll get in my weird improv shenanigans mindset.
Guess I will do the same. That is to say get a few beers just in case.
SunTiger I might be about to lose to a mill rogue who until turn 7 did nothing but weapon up and stab.
Just because I only had cards to deal with minions.
He vanished and returned brann and boom to my hand.
So he got 4 boombots to the face.
And next turn I got to play 4 more.
That did not go his way after all because his deck was actually shit. xP I was worried cos I had 9 cards in hand and all he'd shown was millstuff.
MairBear bran dr. boom is just never good for mill rogues.
Its like some weird mill rogue unique issue.
I'm not convinced it was a mill rogue really he didn't have a single coldlight hit the field nor a gang up.
Just healbotted himself about 4 times.
If you see me launch Baldurs Gate on steam a lot.
I'm just breaking the game by modding the UI.
And by break i mean crash.
Now I am not saying it was a mistake to allow wrestling threads on the alternative sports board.
But the front page is 100% nothing but wrestling.
Its worse than /d/ and dicks.
Or /tg/ and quests.
More like /d/ and girldicks =p.
Because /d/ hates all kinds of dicks unless they're girldicks.
I saw my favourite fitness image macro the other day a really buff guy standing in front of a mirror flexing saying Yup still dead inside D.
GlennCuttlefish Maybe 4chan needs a new board the dickgirls quests and wresteling board.
Like I havent heard that idea billion times already.
I am sure we cxan follow this up with a new board for just Warhammer.
Or one for just MtG.
In fact lets make one for MtG and one for Warhammer even.
I'm fine with MTG and warhammer while somewhat plentyful they are not that disruptive.
Also you know actually TG unlike quests.
My team leader sent out a calendar liking for input on days for charity or engagement events.
With like the Olympics and religious holidays.
So I went onto the business' LGBT group's intranet page and forward him their entire calendar of events.
Because I am a dedicated social justice troll.
Anyway he compromised by putting the local Pride day on.
SunTiger / MairBear how was the HS stream.
ChaosSmurf Civil War Glasgow y/n?
Minister when's it out.
I haven't seen any cards yet so looking forward to watching it.
Minister yeah let's do it.
ChaosSmurf Priest is looking pretty dire for this expansion.
Ok I'll come up Thursday?
Not sure rogue is going to be feeling very fun either.
Things that are not new.
ChaosSmurf okay but they both got worse than they are now.
Minister sure I am working Friday obv but we can go Thurs night?
SunTiger the blade flurry nerf is ludicrous.
Might need to be midnight?
I wasn't expecting just a straight up nothing to fill the gaps that standard is leaving.
And the BGH and Knife Juggler ones are shit.
If they needed to nerf bladflurry for future expansions they should have held off on it.
Right now it just goes FUCK YOU to the only serious working rogue deck.
Found out the really cool looking magic doc is narrated by fucking wil wheaton.
Can you come up Friday instead.
I only booked both off because last year I came up Friday and you'd seen it Thursday =P.
Minister> think juggler goes to 2/2 mana and effect static.
But job now I guess.
The power of unemployment.
So Ex3 is out in pdf and pod.
It'll still be years until they finish redeeming all the stretch goals etc though I think.
The next book should be close to finished if they wanted to have a good release schedule too v.
Also from reading Nishkriya I think there were still errors in the released pdf that were picked up in backer feedback?
C l a s s i c.
ChaosSmurf I think it is tbh.
A book every 3-4 months is what you want.
Like Vance is working on DBs so Arms is at least written unless he just isn't on that book for some reason.
ChaosSmurf when do you work? 9-5?
I made a thing.
Now I'm going to sexualize this doritoe and you can't stop me sometimes I worry where I get art stuff from.
...that's an art stuff?
Anathema made me do it.
It's been ages since I looked at BG.
How does that affect companions?
Yes since it was a video of somebody talking about drawing a thing.
Minister what time is Fiascreation?
How does that affect companions? <- not at all tihs is player character alone.
GlennCuttlefish are you out this afternoon?
Define afternoon and out.
Going to be afk for...a hour maybe two tops while I go shopping but other than that I'm here.
Mainly asking with regard to Mair's question.
As you're often back later than I am if you're out.
Well I have no plans besides buying something to drink and some other groceries.
So I should be back within 2 hours.
SunTiger whatever you do dont read the previous comic to that.
I didn't plan too.
GlennCuttlefish why do you hate fun C.
MairBear what do you mean.
I just didn't think he could handle it.
Blood would spurt out of his nose when he read that page.
And then he would die.
I'd probably just end up sighing untill i passed out.
Frodan looks like an actual child on stream next to Ben Brode.
Especially when brode intentionally makes himself look big.
I swear he's not that huge.
But he was sitting down the entire time.
ChaosSmurf yeah now you can sarcastically way wow.
My sorrys tend to come out from a madder bomber that sixes my own face.
Also now what will i say when i raelize i've been waiting for my opponent to do something but actually i never pressed the End Turn button.
Maybe a thanks for waiting?
ChaosSmurf did you sign up for / get into the TES cardgame ?
No I haven't looked at anything about it.
I noticed it had.
13 free packs damn.
ChaosSmurf i'm gonna get so many packs.
That druid legend is dooooppppeee.
The problem is getting value.
I am gonna Wow every time my opponent plays right into a secret.
< this just about sums up the stream.
I'm gonna play 'wow' when my opponent turn 1 drops stonetusk boar to do 1 dmg to face.
Trying to be a mair.
You just jelly i can wub better than you.
Huh my dad has apparently gotten an idea of wanting to try linux v.
I am so glad Rage Orc bothered to fast-forward that mage doing the 20 damage druid power.
Cos Trolden's lack of edit is snoozy.
Trolden could really afford some more effort into videos.
Doesn't have to be full on animated scenes.
A little more effort.
Man it takes entirely too long to get to free time in the first chapter of DR2.
Gotta farm those influences.
So when are we starting noelor?
Uh I'm going to order pizza.
But whenever you guys like after that tbh.
But where is mairbear.
But what is Mairbear.
A miserable little pile of secrets ?
Mairbear is brb but here-ish.
A scourge upon humanity.
GlennCuttlefish while I'm waiting for pizza to be prepared how many targets does Meik-Flur hit these days with Salvo?
Dob TIL engineers now also have hackathons.
Is that when they get an axe and hack apart bad projects ?
1 base 1 feat 5 from int bonus?
Dob no Civil mostly I think.
You might have fianc�e correct?
Fianc� not fiance.
Oh dear hexchat failing to e-acute accent on me.
SunTiger I cannot achieve true joy untll Silver Peasant and I are married.
BwaS its something weird noelor sclient did.
SunTiger also Iron Stomache is not how that merit is spelt.
With apologies for English.
But was it his first rodeo?
Bleh. todays food experiment doesn't really work.
Will have to go with the casserol route next time I work with sweet potatoes.
Derek Smart's House of Star Citizen Obsessive Insanity ehehehehehe.
Derek smart derek smart DEREK SMART.
That's the new subforum on Games on SA in this case.
I think this game just spoiled itself in a meta way.
I was trying to do a thing but it dont let me. Which usually means things.
Oh no self spoiling game.
Stop trying to break games.
I wasn't even trying to break it this time.
That's what they all say GlennCuttlefish.
And by light rain you mean snow.
Spring and summer in Finland is just a bit less snow than in winter.
You could say it was all orchestrated.jpg.
I saw a guy in the gym doing inverse hanging leg raises was so impressive as in he was hanging upside down by his hands and pulling his knees down towards his chest and then raising them again so he was straight.
Anathema you could check why nishkriya is taking forever to load ?>.
Cpu usage is way up for some reason o_0.
Just gonna reboot it.
Are you sure about that.
This is still infinitly loading.
It seems fine for me at least.
Is there a new season in D3 yet MoonWolf.
ChaosSmurf A Season 6 will begin Friday April 29 at 500 p.m. PDT in North America 500 p.m. CEST in Europe and 500 p.m. KST in Asia. For assistance with time zones click here.
I'm clicking here but I'm getting no assistance with time zones.
CEST is what the west coast of europe is on in summertime.
Brits are an hour behind CEST.
Certainly more clothing that she usually wears.
In other news tickets booked for Civil War on thursday. Non 3D showing too. toot.
MoonWolf refreshed bonsai for the first time after sleep Elemental Elemental Owl.
Noelor i was expecting a pull request when i woke up.
I went to bed pretty much immediately after you.
I shal merge it presently.
I swear to gods if murder wasn't so difficult on this island I would murder that guy.
Funny how that works.
The fact that invincible warstriders are an example of an Artifact N/A does not mean that other slightly more vincible warstriders can't exist at lower ratings.
Lets ask an expert.
Worst doom speedrun ever.
I wish there was a way to turn down the difficulty for just one of the trial minigames.
GlennCuttlefish at least it's not drakengard? D.
Also what the hell game what the hell. This plot has officially gone from psychedelic to whack.
Wait whack is higher on the scale than psychedelic ?
Well it is Who called us whack not Who called us psychedelic.
Whack is higher than psychedelic but still below zany.
And that is saying a lot since there is a guy who carries around and talks to 4 hamsters in this game.
That's as whack as 4 Minscs!
I was willing to accept the premise of a teddy bear kidnapping honor students and making them murder each other.
But this is too far.
GlennCuttlefish has been defeated.

Knife crime problem? what knife crime problem?
Yeah that is definitly not a knife.
GlennCuttlefish what chapter are you on in DG2?
Anathema a shame you missed fiasco.
I won also noelor since it was a sort of joint victory but i got a better outcome score.
GlennCuttlefish and MairBear died.
Glenn ate his own leg.
I was playing Hero Quest and complaining about software though.
Should have played fiasco instead.
Visit the discrete and expensive teahouse.
Its where everyone hangs out.
This cult just has Noahs Arc.
They keep is in a warehouse i guess ?
MoonWolf was Red-Toothed Execution Order the survival charm that didn't really do anything in the backer version?
The name sounds familiar.
Lemme actually open my book.
Both old and new i suppose.
Oh wait yeah I have both still.
And yes it was that one.
It does actual numerical things now!
Yes that was the name of the thing.
Extra successes from the attack roll.
Oh lets see if they fixed solar counterattack.
They fixed the running away from a skunk art.
I think the skunk might be a lunar?
Oh Chejop is still there but now looking at paintings instead of PC game cover art.
Solar counterttack is still vague if kill your opponent cancels damage.
It is now a lunar.
Design Beyond Limit still uses evocation rules that don't exist =V.
So why did they spend 2 months gathering Feedback.
If they didn't actually.
Use that feedback to fix blatant issues ?
Suvival charms also still increase raw stats.
And monster stacksblocks still don't have raw stats.
No i like that they don't.
But it doesn't combine that way.
Now i'm guessing what a statline is made out of to reverse engineer its attributes/abilities.
To recalculate the statlines.
Guess its a whitewolf book though.
I think the internal logic is that everything in the Antagonists chapter is presented as a Quick Character.
But that familiars especially those you're investing more xp into should be fully statted.
But it doesn't explicate that.
And also gives no real guidelines for how to do so.
You just know how to do that noelor.
As a ST you get that ability.
Anathema this book basically assumes at least the ST is already an expert on exalted.
Oh boy does it.
Innisgunn may be the best beer in the world.
MoonWolf you forgot that the rules for training animals are in the Antagonists chapter instead of systems.
Noelor oh yeah thats nice too.
Somehow Deadly Predator Method is allowed to continue as it was.
Anyway setting Ex3 aside because I do like it in aggregate.
Familiars are the real true overpowered weapon of Ex3.
Who is/isn't up for Fellowship?
I'll try some fellowship.
Anathema Fellowship is a fantasy RPG which focuses more on the journey than how to kill goblins and trolls.
It's pretty heavily inspired by Lord of the Rings but applies modern sensibilities onto that story's concept - it also looks like things like Wakfu or if we strip the setting Mass Effect.
In terms of rules it's Apocalypse-powered so heavy on story. Each player character represents a race and each player has full narrative control over their race in the world.
And the GM has their own character the Overlord who levels up and plays the game at the same pace as the party.
Each playing being a race.
You don't play the entire race.
But the character sheet says The Elf instead of The Fighter.
And you're with a couple of exceptions the champion of your race.
The Legolas the Gimli.
What if I want to be The Pippin?
Well sadly the playbook for The Twins which would be Merry and Pippin is still being written.
And I think is low on the list because kickstarter backers had no taste.
But there's a playbook for Sam it's called The Squire.
To let you play as someone who isn't a champion but came along anyway for.
What do you do?
Go on an adventure!
Find places in trouble save the day earn the fellowship of the people living there.
Thwart the Overlord's plans hopefully prevent them from conquering/destroying the world.
Play is divided into three chunks travelling adventures in locations you travel to and downtime where you recuperate in that place you just saved.
Re-save previous places ?
Make up weird facts about fungus orcs ?
Duncan Jones on Warcraft Please go see this movie so I can make another one and put a tauren in. SOLD!
So Draenei in third?
Why doesn't it have tauren in ?
He's doing a panel with Rob Kazinsky and Michelle Morrow.
Timeframe is warcraft 1.
Sorry i'm busy compiling a list of historical magical / alchemical and related books.
So they're not even aware of Kalimdor.
It is pretty much Blizzard trying to rewrite their backstory.
Its hard because FUCK CLICKBAIT.
I would rather than night elves than tauren.
Wanna see how they will do those ears.
Apocalypse-powered so heavy on story. Each player character represents a race and each player has full narrative control over their race in the world <- funnily enough that describes the last 5e DD game I played.
Except it was heavily pulp biblical.
So anathema GlennCuttlefish Fellowship y/n?
Also Cooked_Auto and Dob maybe.
There is a chance my other group will start up FantasyCraft again on thursdays.
And I have Star Wars on tuesdays.
I'll get backto you I am in vital need of sleep right now.
Anathema np I've put the rules and playbooks in the dropbox in any case.
MoonWolf I'm going to delete the backer version of Ex3 from the dropbox on that note.
On account of it's huge and I'm pretty sure that folder is on my account =P.
I'm willing to give it a try.
Also fuck you game for 1 throwing that puzzle at me 2 Somehow spoiling the actual answer so soon.
Even if it did take me a while to figure out the exact logic behind it even when I knew the answer.
<- cults now own magical books and mythical artifacts.
Will improve that tomorrow.
I think i'm just scraping the artifacts section.
It just doesn't mesh.
I'm sure i can reuse the tables at a later point.
Listen carefully skeleton is the best.
Be wary of wheel.
Aggro paladin in the tavern brawl. Drop violet teacher fill the board add raid leader paladin buff secret and blessing for extra seasoning.
And then the round beforehand practically two-shotted opponent with questing adventurer.
Where even aggro paladin takes 30 mins.
Noelor> the deck is 30 raven idols druid 1-drop spell card to discover either minion or spell so every turn is /a lot/ of strategising.
ChaosSmurf ok if I book a train into Central around 6 -> movie -> food?
Well more thought process than the esportals brawl.
Oh gods and now there's a pax paul and storm concert on twitch whelp.
<- fuck yeah BLAME!
Don't know what colours to paint my knight.
Saints purple and ogld.
I am not doing more gold D.
Ravenclaw blue and bronze.
I wanna live in a city where a giant mechanical gorilla protects me fair.
I'd prefer to live in a city where the kind of events that require giant mechanical gorilla protection don't happen at all.
Do green and yellow go togehter?
Ah the good old super soaker camo.
Anathema fuck if i know.
I dont know you tell me.
A bit too bright to work.
Anathema green with yellow trim is kinda Nurgley?
But may work depending on what green and what yellow you have.
Noelor soething like this atm but will be going over it witg a lighter green.
Pls put in game Blizz.
Reconsidering how much yellow I planned so many layers _.
Have fun with that.
Or look for offbrand yellows.
Noelor i revised your exalted 3 cult name addition to remove the overly modern world ones.
And fit character names in better.
Would that improve the fact that layering yellow on black base is paaaainful.
As opposed to random names that don't reference anything on the charsheet.
Did you see the other patch I suggested last night?
To make use of all those artifacts you dug up.
I like those a lot.
{Wrote $T-BooksofMagicAndAlchemy$1} <- a lot of cult leaders are suddenly from the 16 hundreds.
The problem i ran into last night.
Is that while the things were cool.
It that they often were to eclectic a collection or combination of things.
And then didn't mesh with whatever the name or ideas were expressed earlier on.
Like a cult named better living through space future.
With a leader that was born on mars and is a robot.
Owning 5 books on kaballah and the spear of longinus.
Anathema you got a problem with that ?
Good because duality of gender has been traditionally associated with divinity in certain cultures.
Its a strange thing to have as a name though.
Weirder names abound in exalted.
5 layers it took.
Hearthstone daily quest for playing 2-drop or less minions.
Build deck exclusively with 0 to 2-drop minions.
Opponent concedes turn 2 because I played 3 murlocs.
Trying this meal prep sunday stuff.
There is not a lot of calories in green beans.
Anathema but more butter on them.
There is enough calories in everything else I am cooking to make up for them.
Broccoli green beans white fish puy lentils a hard boiled egg a piece of cheese <-- my lunch next week every day.
For some reason put lentils smell like haggis.
Are they in a spice mix?
Or just plain lentils you cook?
They are quite earthy.
I herbed the fish a little.
Ok maybe not the egg and cheese my containers are too small.
See whatsapp for picture.
I see I see.
Without those each should be about 550 kcal and 50g of protain.
Need more energy? put some oil and balsamic.
Or take oil with you in a separate small container.
Oh the tubs fit almost perfectly in the bottom of my thermos lunch bag thing so I can use the top section for the egg and cheese \o/.
I was in a supermarket the other day and was perplexed to find yogurt with zero fat. What on earth is that?
A man after my own heart.
I blame the patriarchy probably.
I may have spent my afternoon building this.
Not the card drawing thats from a library called Sunwell.
Its the start of a mediocre hearthstone card browser.
Fed up of hearthhead?
No i have Reasons that i'm not going to explain at this point in time in case i fail horribly in achieving them.
Its not meant to be used by anyone but me.
I was just happy i got the plumbing bits of the project done.
Todays oglaf was VERY OGLAF.
Like aside from some amount of onscreen sex involving dwarves it couldn't be much more OGLAF.
MoonWolf I bought fat free greek yogurt the other day PURELY BECAUSE it had more protein >_>.
That is my #1 criteria for judging food.
MoonWolf if it weren't for the link to website part I'd suggest hooking PatternSpider into it.
Anathema did you read/think about Fellowship at all?
Well that would require me to have money to have a server.
And then to host a server.
And then to build this in something that isn't clientside javascript.
I have offered to host PS on azure minus the sentience module don't have enough RAM for that.
Noelor not really but I cannot do anything that goes past 10pm so it is unlikely to fit in my schedule.
Why did that fix it.
Current status covered in pain-relieving gel.
The fuck did you do ?
Went for a run.
Don't know why that made my shoulder hurt but it did.
I believe we have reached zany in DR2.
Baaaaalls they don't make the shoes I like anymore and my current pair are falling to bits.
Heroes EU summer regional final on potentially matchpoint starting now.
...Aaaaand now we are at a point where I miss zany.
So where are we at now ?
Somewhere around full retard.
But at least there is some info on The Biggest Most Awful Most Tragic Even in Human History.
Knight progress though! unwashed unhilighted metal trim is gonna be way lighter.
Your yellow went out of line on the .. shoulder ? pic.
Yeah I need to redo the black anyway since it is just a spray on there atm.
There is like 7 coats of yellow... _.
Wanted sortable tables on M'uru.
Now using a js library from 2007.
Lemme just save that for if you guys need to beat up tracer in OTS.
The Genn Greymane one is pretty good too and.
Anathema i mean good try.
But the awnsers are actually.
1 anno was very depressed.
2 anno hated modern mecha anime.
3 weird nonsencical half references to western religious stuff was cool to him.
4 who needs budget anyway.
They just ran out.
5 we sell more gunpla if we do the plot this way.
Not sure thats true.
BwaS 5 we sell more random merch of Rei and Asuka if we do the plot this way - FTFY.
Okay dangan ronpa 2...What the flying fuck were those last...2 hours?
It was very japan.
...I was not expecting this post game mode.
MoonWolf Golden Ancient of Lore? More like free legend of my choice!
Aaaah yeah i have a golden master of disguise.
Good it didn't randomly break.
WOG has been renamed to OG.
Since thats what the developers are using.
This is a 100% valid reason to burn a kingdom to the ground.
Think I should have gone main carapace yellow minor details green on the knight.
There will be other Knights.
Hax my friend's hardcopy of ex3 arrived.
Hardcopy in more than 1 way.
But she is the strongest.
Stronger if she has a gun though.
MairBear Fellowship is a narrative journey-based RPG about a LotR/Wakfu/Jojo3 style band of heroes saving the world from an evil Overlord each player picks a race to be the only member of in the party and own the lore for the overlord is the GM's character.
It'd.. be a bit like OTS but much less mechanical that way and less/less complex fighting.
MairBear I am dismayed and saddened to report to this thread that Blizzard neglected to replace the highly negative and offensive sorry emote on our most beloved and oft-forgotten player character Bran's rickety minecart.
Yeah OtS is a pretty good measuring stick actually.
I was trying to fit my explanation into a single line though.
Also i may not be the best GM for that kind of game.
Turns out I really like high complexity mechanical fights.
With bosses that are actually statues that split into 4 hands.
This is why I'd be the Overlord in Fellowship =P.
Even if building the damn things takes so much time.
Also your fights are cool!
It was cool because thats a fight i could only really do because of OTS's perspective.
MoonWolf your fights both inspire and concern me from a technical thought xD.
Since I don't know stuff about Roll20... or GMing... but I'd like to do things technical like what you do buuuuut.... I'm afraid of the effort and cocking it up B.
I still need to try a mini one of those premade 13th age scenarios some time but I don't want to inflict 13A burnout on anyone B.
I am not even close to burned out on 13A.
And I expect MoonWolf would welcome a chance to actually *play*?
It would be nice to actually play.
I started gm'ing 13th age because it was my best chance at playing a non shit dnd-ish game.
But i sure would like to play it.
Maybe I should run a brief mini-adventure where all the thinking is done for me just to see if I can make things do things o.
13th Age just makes the most sense to me and I don't get lost in the numbers and the rolls xD.
See if you can get your hands on the Organised Play materials.
Irl dex 5 O.
MoonWolf for the comma suffixed bits of artefact names *can* they be generated? I can see they don't seem to be in ArtifactNameWeapon.
Anathema it is somewhere.
Exalted generated weapon names are all in ArtifactNameWeapon.
I think MoonWolf might only have done the comma thing for armour?
They both do it.
Oh wait yeah they do.
Anathema what are you even looking at.
Also dammit opening that table I noticed another typo.
Oh no those are not random.
Noelor make an issue.
You can make them random.
I may at some point.
At that point in time i didn't feel like building a massive effort name generator for names that sometimes show up on some merits.
Each successively deeper bit of generation is severe diminishing returns yeah.
Better off just thinking of one.
Noelor RANDOMIZE ALL THE THINGS.
Anathema this is how you build dwarf fortress.
You just make everything a template right.
And recursively walk down the tree of templates.
That is sort of already what this does.
Only you have to decided where to stop.
You stop when the result of the template has no other templates in it duh.
And then you need to.
So you decide when to stop making templates.
Well that's naxx cleared on hs. Just in time for standard! D.
Noelor well eventually you get to {{weapon}} which could resolve to {{colour}} {{weapon-type}} and those tables resolve to like 'Blue' 'Sabre'.
Let's be real though.
That's nowhere near evocative enough for Exalted.
Thats why you need a LOT of templates.
Pretty happy with how M'uru turned out with how much time it took to build.
Its search box works a lot like the HS one only without all the special features for filtering by range of attack/mana/health.
Is this pre or post-nerf M'uru? Kappa.
You made it pretty.
Advanced filter options.
Not so pretty now.
Anyway the real power here is that it lets be look at arbitrary collections of cards.
Fucking blizzard have a cheaty yogg-saron.
The Song That Ends the World Crash the game server. No really.
Good they made it legendary wouldn't want someone to have TWO of those.
Noelor someone probably needed to test server recovery after a crash.
Tch this AI playing the ETC and it's not even a golden what an upstart.
I'm glad the phoenix wright has alt subs on CR.
Wouldn't be the same without burgers.
Marvellous get up to emperor and find the encounter bugged.
According to forums known issue might be new from recent patch.
Is definitly from the new patch.
They modified the ai to be more about trading on board.
MoonWolf seems like it would make things a decent bit easier?
See that boss has a minion.
That MUST NOT DIE.
If she dies the boss instawins next turn.
Its on the boss' side of the field.
So now he's hitting other minions with where before he would go face.
None of my decks are valid xD.
Cos I disenchanted all the basic cards I could xD.
You can't shard basics p.
Apparently Mair managed to do it.
Hehe patron warrior shines in the Garr fight I think.
Man that was fun.
Okay executus just gave rag 5 molten giants to play with. Lol.
A spirit bomb of bicurious hipster-love this is the subtitle of my new album.
This is such a prototypical fan wiki segment.
I hope Smurf can breathe on Friday.
It rebooted my VM.
!note MairBear look at this pack opening animation.
Ftrbzzs did you get to act 3?
Dangan ronpa 2 summed up in a single picture.
Noelor I cant take all this foreshadowing in poppy.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish if I started Fellowship on Friday 6th does that work for you?
That would be fine.
As I'm in Glasgow this Friday assuming Smurf is still breathing.
I've also roped in another of Janos' exalted players though Janos himself has passed on Fellowship.
Minister most likely should be fine. There is a miniscule chance I will be playing board games that night.
Look at those gorgeous models.
Glenn want do do things to ...where were we... Dark Chi Bears?
Minister Friday 6th seems fine o.
Also am stuck listening to.
Apparantly all it takes for ChaosSmurf to use twitlonger is to be unable to breathe.
It is snowing <- its fucking april get your shit together over there.
Apparently it snowed in the southern parts here as well during the weekend.
Orbit's lawyers made me very carefully describe the female Home Secretary as clearly not being one of her non-fictional predecessors not even a little bit. lol.
6 weeks until the next Laundry novel O.
GlennCuttlefish wildlife relocation some time today? o.
ChaosSmurf I'm on mumble with Gimbleb.
And I said he should come on friday too.
What are we doing for tickets?
Former top Scottish Starcraft 2 player?
Noelor dunno lemme talk to my mates here see if they wanna come too.
And keep gimbleb in the loop if you still have his deets right.
I have him on twitter.
Hehe hehe mage blizzards a fresh dr boom with no minions on their side. Boombot lethal.
MoonWolf when is old gods live in EU.
Why don't you know.
You're a games news guy.
It's probably 5 PM asia 5PM America and when they get around to it for us like with brawl.
Think the usual blizzard line is morning but not overnight type of morning.
Depends entirely how long they need servers down for.
Well it's already live in US MairBear.
Noelor doesn't look like they're coming do you still have Gimble on Vent?
Proves my point D8.
Like think the US launch time was off say california morning.
They're a Cali company so yeah.
ChaosSmurf hopefully after the 1 hour maintainence at 0030 CEST?
Noelor do you wanna just book 3 tickets.
What's the cinema again?
ChaosSmurf 1850 at cineworld.
The second one of these.
These MoonWolves and the Bears >C.
Taunting me with their being in the game.
Don't worry I'm only a 3/3 Ironfur Grizzly.
Haha ofc the only deck it says is standard eligible is a basic rogue netdeck I used for lvling XD.
Hoh boy half the mage deck needs replacing...
BWaS none of my decks are standard friendly Dx.
Replace Wild Card Elite Tauren Chieftain yep ETC was always a wildcard.
Shine on you moonlight stallion o7.
Paladin manages to be 2/3 valid.
Rip beautiful mana curves.
Shaman deck is only half-standard too.
Warrior gets away with only 12 casualties.
Priest is jettisoning 13.
And warlock is the winner with only 11 of 30 eligible!
Shit... and I drew mal'ganis from a booster pack in october 2014.
Hmm wait might be december 2014. filename format adopting datestamp may be US centric.
Facebook's translation engine is getting better.
Otoh it has just told me Cooked_Auto said the shite not fasting which is... not quite right I suspect.
C'thun says creepy c'thun stuff when he gets buffs D.
From inside the deck?
OKAY FUCK THIS SHIT.
This is my THIRD.
Game is just giving me half a legnedary each time.
Oooh a fandral staghelm.
That was a quality set of 5 packs.
Yes the day after the Good Friday stream I contracted not just H1N1 but pneumonia as well. From what I’ve been told I came within hours of dying. If I didn’t go to the hospital when I did I wouldn’t be here right now. I was placed in a medically induced coma for two and a half weeks so most of April is just not there for me and had a breathing tube forced down my throat.
And that is the sound gamepad falling onto a keyboard makes.
Bs power-creep that you can have 3/5/1 and 3/5/2 both blank.
BwaS the flavor text for am-gam rager is actually power creep in reverse.
Haha playing the 'evolve' naga fight in LoE. One of my minions evolved into Doomsayer and immediately wiped the board D.
Took them long enough.
Pretty good when you've already won.
Even if you hadn't already won though.
It wiped the board gave you a new board put some more cards in your hand put some more cards in your deck that was running low and then put up 5 secrets.
That was just genuinly GOOD.
It could have just cast 3 sprints and killed me though.
Like i said best yogg i've seen all day.
And i've been loking at stuff all day.
It could have cast call the darkenss and cast tree of life too.
I think it should probably.
Cast half as many spells with smart targeting.
But they'll never change it so.
Looking forward to the C'Thun nerf.
Noelor what seats are we in.
There are three of us.
So it was either back row or real near the front.
And Gimbleb is a tall gentleman.
Tarquin's brother is coming.
<- here is the new updated version of the sutpidly big exalted 3e map.
I did not check yet.
I see no difference between the maps.
MairBear what even.
Noelor nah he can't make it.
Blame noelor he fixed my horrible roll.
I just hit quickload when I found myself in Kvatch.
GlennCuttlefish lo and behold you have gotten your wish.
Now you can go back to bitch about there being too many 40k threads on tg.
Sweet jesus I might finally be able to go back to /tg/.
...that's the second time I've heard that tonight =|.
I've been writing a modern light fantasy story for uni.
And I made a word a proper noun and have now written it enough that it's stopped being a word >_<.
I'll go get something to eat for breakfast and on the way there and back I can mull over the conclusion of this story.
*spends the whole trip thinking about how to cosplay Sans*.
First be a skeleton.
Its all boners anyway.
The most unexpected nominee though was Chuck Tingle author of the dinosaur erotica short story Space Raptor Butt Invasion. D.
Anathema not tall enough.
Also would involve actual armour rather than PJs and a hoody.
This is cool.
That was my last assignment.
I just got marks back from the previous one an autobiographical piece.
Other than the poetry I felt it was my worst.
So obviously it has the highest mark.
I think you and the current grader just don't have the same sort of ideas about writing.
Other than we both agree that I can't write poetry.
Its okay to be bad at poetry.
I just looked through her comments on my poems.
Not accepting that fact just leads to vogon poetry and nobody wants that.
One is about skeletons and she comments that it feels very staccato.
I blame Undertale for associating staccato sounds with skeletons in my brain forever.
Anyway moving on from uni.
KotOR is now out... on Android?
I could play KotOR on my phone now if I wanted to.
Cooked_Auto n-shift rebracketing is a beautiful category of etymology.
The fuck is Cooked_Auto n-shift rebracketing.
Pretty that Cooked_Auto wasn't there.
MoonWolf Cooked_Auto linked a thing about it.
Omg the Arabic equivalent is why Iskandar exists.
How will we play fellowship if you're a singularity.
MairBear will have to make and play the Overlord.
That'll be a very different game then.
Holy shit patternspider ACTUALLY LOADED ON MONO.
I'm going to have to reinstall this just to downgrade a version.
To be able to install a package i need for this.
Now if only the rest of linux wasn't being such a pain in the ass right now.
That was Civil War seen it's good. At least I thought so.
!note MairBear are you ready for D3 tonight ?
Every now and again I remember that the guy behind HPatMoR is an avid cryonics supporter and I feel a little better about myself.
If you think thats the only thing thats weird about him you are sooo far off.
I mena I know he believes in the singularity too.
How much do you know about LessWrong ?
Not much its a rationalist wiki thing about covers it.
Well i'm not about to go into a big rant about how everything they've every done is stupid or insane.
So instead i'll tackle on dumb thing.
Throughout this it is important to remember that the LessWrong people and Yudkowsky who runs the place.
Take this very seriously.
Roko's Basilisk is the idea that if we should never try to build a true artificial inteligence.
I found a wiki page.
Because if we do eventually we will make one and then that one will bootstrap itself into superpowers singularity style.
And then it'll torture anyone in the past.
Who doesn't help build it.
'The notion is taken sufficiently seriously by some LessWrong posters that they try to work out how to erase evidence of themselves so a future AI can't reconstruct a copy of them to torture.'.
I wasn't JOKING when i said they actually take this seriously.
Oh I remember that thread on PYF.
Anathema also they they don't believe in actual time travel.
So they are worried the ai will build Fake version of them in memory.
But see because they are suficiently advanced fake people running in memory.
Yeah I got to the bit on acausal trade.
Lesswrong people have used the simulated people being tortured by an ai to make you do something it wants.
And its dumb EVERY FUCKING TIME.
Why are they called Lesswrong.
I don't really know.
I try not to question internet community names.
Because its always dumb.
I assumed it was something like.
It's less wrong to murder every scientist working on AI.
Than let them create an AI.
ChaosSmurf I think it just means the members are less wrong about things.
Guess I should do some work today.
My skin feels weird and itchy don't like |.
>includes his recently amputated leg.
This reference is a bit late blizzard.
Like most Blizzard references then.
!note MairBear i've been waiting for this image to show up.
It's a shame he's probably lost that game.
Time to GO HARD in d3.
Spotify is really stupid sometimes.
'arch enemy and eluveite totally belong in the same playlist!'.
Tags are not great.
I did generate a playlist for music like this song.
It included Slanias Song by eluveite.
They actually didn't break d3 horribly?
Season started 35 minutes ago mair.
I tried to stay up and watch Noelor finish LoE cos rafaam fight.
But I had to sleep first for an odd twist.
I have seen the announcement trailer for Dawn of War 3 and it's the single weirdest trailer I have ever seen.
It's embargo'd until Tuesday.
But it's super melancholy.
Oh goodie I can tease people on skype about it because we talked DoW last night 3c.
I'd link it but I'd be Actually Fired.
Game's got titans in it tho.
Does it look closer to DoW 1 or 2 gameplay wise? or is there no way to tell?
I can just tell them to expect something on tuesday.
ChaosSmurf So how legit is this btw?
Anathema press release says closer to DoW 1.
I think my speculation that it would be like WC3 is going to be spot on.
BF5 is getting revealed next week tho.
Obv Andromeda will be there.
How hype would it be if the campaign was 30k stuff?
Based on this trailer it is not.
But that would be sweet.
I woudn't expect it to be just dreaming p.
They can't make good 30k games.
Because it has good books.
Can't have more than one good thing per Warhammer.
Battle of the Abyss says otherwise P.
That one before Battle.
The first 3 HH books are great.
I need to get the 4th.
ChaosSmurf What do you have against adventures ON CALIBAN?!
Anathema 4th is okay.
5th is the shit.
Can you link me the thread that's from Cooked_Auto.
Just a random find in a Star Wars thread thats even from the comic board.
ChaosSmurf 'the shit' or 'shit' ?
He did say the shit and not It's shit.
WELL STOP BEING BLIND THEN.
Aye there we go.
Logged on train immediately entered a tunnel.
Well that's cute my WoW account just got WoD for free.
ChaosSmurf so I missed my train by about a minute but thought it was ok because the next one to Edinburgh was only 10min later.
Turns out the next trains out of Edinburgh are all every-damn-stop cross country services.
It's not like I'll ever play WoW again anyway p.
Fellowship people one of the core things that tracks progress of sorts is Sources of Power - mcguffins the Overlord is searching for to do dastardly things with presumably.
And the book guideline is that at a minimum each People being played should have an associated Source of Power.
So if anyone wants to start thinking of cool mcguffins that'd be handy because I'll ask next week anyway.
Somehow I have been hijacked into playing an irish jewish giovanni in a vampire campaign.
Uncertain. it is silly but I'll roll with it.
Is it possible to share your roll20 exalted deck thing for fiasco noelor?
Or even the base deck.
Wait they're not here.
Sharing stuff like that isn't really possible.
In that case the kung fu deck they used as basis I guesss.
Overwatch open beta access comes with a second key for a friend so people who want in without prebuying should note me or BWaS probably maybe Smurf.
If anyone cares I found the casting list for the Japanese OW voices.
Tonight was a sad bar night almost ended up on the dancefloor did not end in karaoke.
On the other hand I need to find a second karaoke song that I can do with my voice.
I have one good one and I really dont want to be one wonder hit P.
Well do relatively well. my voice is too nasal for most things I think. Then again I should probably try recording some songs to see what I can do.
Is the song I usually sing when I dont want to get boo'd off the stage. Its in finnish and in Helsinki slang at that so even I dont understand all the words.
OTOH my favorite loan word is in Helsinki slang.
Ööga is just so good of a word Derive from ögon I think.
Can slang even be considered loan words?
GlennCuttlefish Noelor says yes.
Well that explains why noelor was not here then.
Oh dear. Just noticed my booze reserves are running low.
I say low I have a litre of vodka.
But tomorrow is mayday.
But thats the important part.
And I may have promised to actually open up emotionally to a friend as well on sunday.
Oh that's neat. Widowmaker and Mercy's VA's did Koko and Valmet in Jormungand.
Sure is fun meeting all these c'thun decks on the ladder...
Haha D.Va's VA did Rory in Gate.
MoonWolf Izual on T2 and Grift 20 for full set.
I wrote up most of the Overlord's sheet on the train yesterday.
One of his weapons has the tag Ganon Tennis not a real tag but communicates its effect to at least me.
Oh no grace bad ended her passivist run.
MoonWolf apparently someone complained at Dan for how violent that was.
I feel is a legitimate response to the legion.
!note MairBear a little kid made some HS cards.
Edinburgh Waverley train station surrounded by tunnels.
Fellowship is now available in dead tree form! \o/.
Mine should show up at my folks' mid-May.
My top two pieces of Overlord art are on either side of a two-page spread as opposed to back-to-back on a single leaf do that's cool.
Gnome posted some preview pics on K$.
Talking of Fellowship there are a few different suggestions for the first session.
My favourite but one that definitely requires player buy-in is that we open with the first time y'all meet the Overlord.
And he beats you so now it's definitely personal.
I think i'd prefer to not do that.
Scottish money report managed to spend my fakest-ever �20 note still have very-not-real �5 and �10 now I'm back across the border.
Yes we all know they are comfy to wear.
Heh I still have 3 RBS twenties in mine.
Cooked_Auto the j means denim though.
Because that's how we do that now.
Of course you do.
Noelor u wot m8?
Oh you are around.
I need some sort of AI that automatically buys stylish clothes I'd like.
Anathema it would get you plain t-shirts and jeans.
And everything would be fine.
I can do jeans and t-shirts.
I spent like a 2 hours looking for a jacket today.
10 grownup points for you.
Oof just had a game against a cthun warrior go right to the wire with dragon priest.
Chromaggus double top-decking shit saving my bacon.
Those were certainly words.
What's funny is that I've hung around the MtG people at the café enough to know what he means with the second sentence.
Okay tbf I know what top decking sort of means P.
Also people who care GlennCuttlefish MairBear Cooked_Auto maybe ? i have a beta key for overwatch to give away.
I'l pass. Not really interested in actually playing the game.
I'll take it if mair doesn't want it. I'd love to try it out but not sure if my computer can actually run it so it might be wasted on me.
Better to realize that now than after you've bought it.
GlennCuttlefish what's your spec.
I managed to run it at 30fps 1080p on low on my old machine.
Which was 550ti 6 gigs of RAM 4 year old processor.
Might be able to run it if I lower the resolution. graphics card might still cause problems.
Mairsaid give it glenn. so here you go.
Enter it on the battle.net site.
This game certainly is a metroidvania.
So I run into a boss die and figure I'll check the hallway to the left instead to see if there is a warp point or something useful before retrying the boss.
3 areas later I find another boss.
Oyu did this to yourself.
I dont mind exploration is great in games like this.
What are you playing GlennCuttlefish.
Xpiratez best mod for OLD Xcom - you lead a band of probably-not-lesbian mutant pirates several hundred years after XCOM lost and the aliens took earth huh.
Its art is TERRIBLE.
Its full of naked or half naked tings for no good reason.
And has a tech tree all about slavery.
The sex kind.
Could've been worse could've been the non sex kind.
Also your armor is stuff like gym outfit and maid outfit.
Although in this case I thought it was more the BDSM slavery thing and not the Back alley hooker.
More hooker less bdsm.
Well thats a pity.
Well go play it then.
There is some okay ideas in there.
But also some terrible terrible stuff.
Yeah like it being an xcom mod.
Why is this anime season so good.
What did you rank 5 with MoonWolf.
I noticed my mage and hunter were close to 500 wins at the start of the season.
So i pushed them both to gold.
T h e g r i n d.
I did not set out to get to rank 4.
I probably shoulda just played Wild.
Nobody who is actually good at the game would have been there.
Seriously that hunter deck was something i made for a dialy 3 months ago.
And I wouldn't have had to face Blizzard's latest hilarity.
Gratz on your 4. Made it to 18 myself.
Did not realise though the 50% cut-off is as low as the 19/18 threshold.
Oh its very low.
So many people just don't play past 20.
I think Legend is 0.5 or less.
Like heroes ranked claims 1 rank per 2%.
The HS one is dynamic.
With a bit of a skew at the bottom as 50-41 you can't derank.
Its actually accurate for the season.
I think the bottom 50% of League are in Bronze/Silver.
It's a lot better to just think about it as.
Those signs are backwards obv.
ChaosSmurf but what if i know i can get to 5.
But just don't try.
But a robot can get to 5.
Cause it requires a winrate of 40% or something.
In fact somebody who does literally nothing can get to 5.
By running a simulation over an infinite time period.
Eventually they run into enough people who don't do anything in a row.
While they're on the play so they fatigue first.
I mean technically that works up to Legend rank 1 as well but the chances get a lot smaller.
I theory i could run into a chain of 50 people who just concede first turn because they got a phonecall too.
But thats not going to actually happn.
I think if you set up a machine to just do HS matches every single minute of every day.
It would get to 5.
If you started it now.
Definitely if you actually let it play.
If not you generated a free wins out of rank 25 bot.
Actually you could do that.
Make a concede bot.
Tbh it would climb to at least 20.
Cause you can't lose rank until ... 15 or something.
20 is when you can loose ranks.
Maybe if i felt like getting banned i'd try it.
A golden dragonhawk rider. Hmm more useful than the golden eviscerate I got last time.
Dob dust it tbh.
Also right Pandemic Legacy.
I didn't even play tonight but.
My friends reached the end of July.
And found a new character.
I dunno sharding a golden common to get enough mats for a regular common *shrug*.
And as part of their flavour text they're like btw you've been taking placebos for the last few months.
And then that good common comes from the next pack and you shard the duplicate for 5 dust.
Cooked_Auto in StarFox Zero you can do a barrel roll and yes I know that's not what it is in the tank.
You could do that in Starfox 64.
The things I do for fun.
GlennCuttlefish you sure found a fucking anime as hell game.
I know its great.
Anathema that looks okay.
But the yellow seems a bit harsh ?
If anything the yellow needs to be flattened or dulled.
Second model of the week and first model of may finished toot.
Brightening the green might work as well as dulling the yellow.
But it's probably easier to do the latter with like an ink layer or something.
I hate these hearthstone tourneys that simulate a tavern where no-one's drinking.
Not really a tavern then is it.
I still can't decide if I like kiznaiver.
Oh I hadn't checked last weeks Asshole classtrip either.
I don't think he likes your nick for Arse Clarse.
Also hot damn found a can of stuffed olives time to party it up like it was may day's eve.
Neat apparently Fromsoftware's next title whatever it may be is going to be VR.
Or at least supports PlaystationVR.
Omg omg omg MoonWolf.
He has a discounted entomb.
He has a summoning stone. He casts the entomb. His stone brings out that Djinn that steals any spell cast on another minion.
I know how this ends.
Thought it was a duplicate not a steal?
Not terrible I guess.
Take a shot for every one that applies to you.
But then that plays into his hands with the drunkards line at the top!
But I was already drinking to that.
The biggest mystery for me is Dirty Dancers.
What do they have against that movie? Maybe they haven't had the time of their life.
Todays oglaf is great.
I want more comics with xoan ambassador though.
ChaosSmurf your deck needs an early game.
It's no mildly evil disembodied head.
MoonWolf.
MoonWolf kibler sick play Thoughtstole dark iron dwarf had a shadow-word madness buffed his own minion to 3 attack and board clears enemy.
Aaaaa this feels even weirder.
Finally got around to fixing my front tooth that was missing for like 2 years.
Ps Goddamn its too warm.
Yeah its too warm in finland.
Because its just as warm as here.
He does that with very little windup.
This seems like a practical weapon.
Best WM skin.
I agree with Cooked_Auto's in-depth Overwatch analysis.
Though why is the picture before it Moes of the Storm?
Because I trawled through a HoTS thread and found it?
Now that I have the ability to open all images in a 4chan thread I can just trawl through game general threads for stuff.
Without having to read a single asinine post.
I mean yes obviously Wanda should've flung him into a wall or something but she was clearly too surprised to do so.
Infernal snoop dog.png.
>opponent summons Servant of Yogg.
>It Ice Lances itself.
There we go.
A new DLC hero for The Last Stand.
OOoh you missed what Smurf said a couple of days ago.
No that's the DoW3 reveal.
Well I guessed it might be but the cynic in me has something else.
Nah Smurf mentioned the press embargo lifts on tuesday and he's already seen the trailer.
Ah k. So telling ocd doesn't count as breaking any embargo then gotcha.
Well he didn't link the trailer if that's what you're asking.
Well ofc just informing of a secret they're keeping and what it is kinda feels like it counts.
Catching up to miko kuma again.
This woman is not going to anime heaven.
MoonWolf you seen this new HL2 run.
Debuted on gamesdonequick Twitch last night.
44 mins or so.
Also on their YT but this apparently has description after it.
I'll watch that later.
Looks like it's basically one new trick tbh but.
And teh new trick skips a lot of the BS.
What is the new trick ?
So they just OOB a lot.
One new trick to beat Half Life fast!
Thanks for the headline.
Ahaha christ it isn't even a ceiling clip it's literally just flying upwards.
Without standing on a thing ?
You get wedged it looks like.
And it puts you half in teh wall and then you can just jump to the top of the map.
I assume they'll explain it after.
So far it cuts out a lot of the BS but keeps all the cool bunny hopping bits.
Gonna see Civil War tonight D.
Boiled in a vat of cheese omg USA why -.
Could be worse could've been bacon.
Looks like the overwatch beta is a success.
I was in a qeuee.
To log int battle.net.
Well it's overwatch beta AND diablo season AND still some people probably gushing about WotG.
Well overwatch is playable if not optimal. I just wish it would stop randomly crashing.
I've not had it crash yet.
Seems smooth to play though.
I start getting fps drops after a while but mostly smooth.
The in built headphone surround option in overwatch seems decent.
I don't have fancy headhpone surround.
It should work on normal stereo headphones.
Since its software side.
I want a suit of armour.
Hahaha using the foam pad to squat while wearing armour.
Why isn't software surround a standard thing by now? that's how human hearing works.
I would assume its 1 Most people don't care 2 Software isn't....That good always 3 Licensing issues.
The sound is kindla muddled farther away but it does seem accurate enough.
Today in Dutch names G. Van Der Pauw.
That is not how consonants Dutch =<.
A pauw is a peacock.
This turret robot seems effective.
MoonWolf went up against a ... murloc hunter.
Who was so scared by psych-o-tron that he only managed to start acting when the rope nearly took his turn from him.
Psych-o-tron is great for murlocs.
Since its great at murdering a ton of tiny things.
MoonWolf halp I went up against a slow warlock.
Who got me down to 7 hp.
So I'm down to 1 hp.
He plays soulfire.... on my infernal.
And the infernal discards his knife juggler.
Not sure if bad or bm.
And he had 2 mana to play.
So he just tapped and quit.
No no I had lethal on board.
Can I please have these opponents on EU pls.
EU only has people better than ... that.
I wish this turret robot wasn't easily my best class.
But bastion is fun.
\Think of the birds glenn.
The shield hammer...robot? Is good as well. Sadly I am still terrible with actual offense on that character.
Its a guy in a robot suit.
Nice I think I managed to go a whole round without dying as tracer.
Wait no I did die. Damn.
This game is not built around not dying.
I mean it's nice.
But tbh dying is usually the quickest way of switching hero.
Also the only robots are Bastion and Zenyatta.
MoonWolf knowing it's a bird doesn't help me pronounce a diphthong as a consonant.
Minister its like ow as in the expression of pain.
Its a comic-book sound effect?
No its a bird.
But it's pronounced like 'pow' ?
If I keep dying it usually means I am doing something stupid.
Goddamn shield robot putting the team on my back here.
I will never stop calling him a robot.
Whats that turret robot? Growing roots there? Not facing me like a man? FUCK YOU YOU GET ULTIMATE ON THE GROUND DEAD LIKE YOUR DREAMS OF EVER BEING SUCCESSFUL.
GlennCuttlefish turret robot used to have a front facing shield.
Be happy he does not anymore.
That sounds hilariously OP.
According to blizzard it was OP for new players.
And pointless for people with extensive experience.
It didn't have full freedom of rotation.
Since they never got into situations where they took on a bastion from the front.
Was the trade off.
Now it can spin 360 but has no shield.
Oh ok that seems slightly less broken then.
Now there are games that do some really tricky stuff with the audio RAM in the case of the game we discovered was broken ATV Quad Racing 2 they were using the audio RAM for storage of bones and animation. I love the Dolphin progress reports.
I see the wii is limited enough people are doing Weird Things to it to sqeeze out performance.
Has games that so weird things with memory leading to bugs.
Nah the wii-u is decent enough that unless you really wish to push it thats not needed.
Same for the 3ds having enough performance for its screen size.
Plus rumours persist that the NX will be x86.
I don't buy that.
That's what the X stands for!
Hopefully it will be doubt it however.
It will be eXtreme.
In fact it's the Nintendo eXtreme.
Goddamn it now my image saver addon broke with the latest FF update argh.
There we go.
Huh Smurf wasn't wrong. It is a weird trailer.
So much for my last stand new hero reveal idea.
Oh only 3.
I was hyping for a well dow1 and dow2 were 4 at launch here's the trailer reveal for our super secret chaos faction!
How do you get medals in OW.
Come top of your team in various categories.
Only your best medal affects experience gained last I checked.
Hmm the trailer shows bad moons design orks but lore says it's gorgutz who used evil suns in WA/DC.
Oh god the game isn't even out and the lore nerds are on it.
Some sort of Nasty Celestial Object.
Base building is making a return after being excised from the sequel - RPS.
Somehow ended playing with my WoW guild.
Cooked_Auto inb4 all his reply feed is Undertale.
Also not going to click but is it Paiden Earce?
No idea but he has a mask.
But this time rolled up sleeves.
And another Iconic Hattm.
Oh neat I've got art for my SW character at last.
Oh hey token tool works fine now v.
I can drag and drop just fine.
Well at least it works.
Yeah I dunno could've been a later Java update or something.
Behold terrible terrible hs cards.
Generated by neural network.
Thats just an xchat window.
...yeah I was about to say.
Those are the terrible HS cards.
Guess I missed that.
Wonder why does the game keep crashing.
Update your drivers ?
ChaosSmurf you said the DoW3 trailer had titans those are clearly just Imperial Knights p.
Oh my god glenn xD.
Doesn't titan kinda get used for any of titan/wraithknight/gargant?
Nah Knights are half-titans afaik.
Trigglypuff -reddits name for that recently viral protestor I'm innappropriately amused.
I don't care if it's bm I'm gonna fuse you the turn you have lethal with your duplicate triple reno deck. PogChamp.
MairBear did you see my terrible HS cards ?
Computer generated by a terribly dumb computer.
Soon it will be like the MtG AI.
That is the end-goal.
And maybe one day it will start designing clothes.
Not so much that.
Because that's a thing that happened an AI designing clothes.
MairBear this is probably the best one.
And by best i mean most OP.
And the previously-silent protagonist Corvo Attano will now have a voice of his own too courtesy of the guy we used to call Garrett. oho.
Cooked_Auto i apreciate this.
Oh jeez they're dissecting the pose and adjusting the lighting to guess who it is aren't they.
Coin innervate innervate six drop turn one. yeah piss off you're getting fused m8.
I just realized my dreams frequently have a stack of 3 2euro coins in them. Wonder why.
Well I can't deny that.
6 euros is a nice amount to have. You can live like a king for a day with it.
Thats like food and even a couple of beers.
...6 euros is food AND a couple of beers?
With finnish prices and cheap beer maybe.
A couple of store bought folkbeers and food would be within a 6eu price range.
Cheap pizza cheap beers.
You're missing the fact that it won't taste good..
I eat food sludge for most of my meals p.
Your food shakes taste better then cheap pizza -D.
....Why does OW suddenly crash all the time.
Ana is making headway into the cyberpunk world.
Soon he'll be raving about the benefits of Soylent Viridians or krillburgers.
Hey food-paste is schway easy to prep easy to eat!
Have to say I got a bit too excited about a local company producing 'pulled oats' that have no meat protein in them.. it's the future!
How much protein per 100g / kcal are we talking here?
I have to check.
My lunch today is chicken rice soybeans and cheese.
Anathema 27 – 314 g / 100 g depending on their product.
Kinda tempted to try vegetarian diet but nothing comes close to chicken as a protein source it seems.
That is a lot.
Yeah hoping they grow more popular soon so I get to buy some.
It always sells out before I get to the shops.
Okay so there is a known issue with older graphics card drivers with overwatch.
Now I just would like to find newer drivers from my card than ones from 2014.
There might not be any if your card is old enough.
Yeah if it's AMD.
Fortunately it was nvidia and the latest gameready drivers still support it.
Its like 5-6 years old though.
So's mine I think.
Of course it's hard / to have intercourse over / four sets of / corsets rap rhyme/meter schemes are whack sometimes.
The fuck are you listening too Minister.
Anathema why did I arrive to you complaining about your love life?
Hercules Mulligan is OG.
Much more interesting discussion than my love life.
I mean that was half of the foundation of my jibe.
Is it still a jibe when it's true?
I got the pirate skin for torbjorn.
But its going to be taken away from me with the reset.
Also playing mei is good fun.
Ah yes now I remember why I haven't bothered updating beyond that point.
Because anything after that is a pain in the ass to install.
Minister compound words in german / dutch stuff that may interest you.
MoonWolf is aansprakelijkheidswaardevaststellingsveranderingen a real word?
German is a great language. I remember a story my grandma told me about a friend who was just learning German. He wanted to ask for a Fliegenklatsche fly swatter but couldn't remember the word. So he asked for a Fliegentotschlagerding thing-used-to-punch-flies-to-death amazing.
It has been a while since I was this frustrated at this piece of shit computer.
And fuck you nvidia.
How the fuck can your uninstaller even fail.
Anathema its real in that its a word that makes sense.
Its not real in that i don't think anyone ever used it.
I can give you some long words that are Real though.
Are they are good as Fliegentotschlagerding >.
Fuck it. booting up in safe mode manually removing everything related to nvidia and geforce.
Anathema i don't know.
What yo dyou think about pensioenfondstoetredingsvoorwaarden or arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering ?
What do they literally translate as?
Pension fund entrance requirements.
That one is harder.
I'd never translate it that way.
But thats about the literal translation.
Its permanent disability insurance.
Reddit is like going to Walmart at 1AM. It's great for reminding me that no matter how disgusted with myself I am there are people out there even more pathetic.
If you're not playing Lucio like a character from Jet Set Radio walljumping and tagging every surface in sight then you're not playing him right. <- someone who is right about lucio.
Is Overwatched release or something?
It is in open beta.
Also known as the demo beta.
It's not in open beta until tonight.
It's in pre-order beta v.
ChaosSmurf you'll probably enjoy this.
I'm working on making more hs cards through neural networks.
<- terrible terrible cards.
It needs work.
!hs Fiery War Axe.
Team Cap vs Team Stark.
Alright my case and screenprotector for my N7 arrived today.
Nvm just the case v.
MoonWolf tinkering with PatternSpider?
Cooked_Auto is... is that Bucky on the left?
I mean it's Team Captain America after all.
MoonWolf tinkering with PatternSpider? .>.
Cooked_Auto he looks nothing like in the movie o.I.
Although I'd kill to see Cap with a beard in Avengers 3.
Cooked_Auto they're the Secret Avengers now.
MoonWolf Game is still on for tonight right?
TIL MoonWolf hasn't played Paper Mario.
Yeah tbh the only full-body shots are 3D.
There's which I think is from the enemy log?
What good is a matchmaking system that gives you more than a 50% loss rate down at the very fucking bottom jeez.
Dob beginning of the season still.
A quarter of the ways in.
Okay maybe not a week past the patch.
So close. Sooo close.
Or possibly just Moth ?
MERRY BIRTHDAY SMURFLE <3.
Brb just remembered my bin 100% needs to be out back tomorrow morning.
ChaosSmurf that mode7 twitter.
Is some high-quality internet.
Current desktop and N4 background.
Current N7 background p.
At the dawning of the third day look to the west...
Onlywatch open beta eu now live for those who didnt purchase early access.
MoonWolf and Glenn have been playing since yesterday I think =P.
Hey MairBear up for a couple of rounds of OW?
Is a couple of rounds as much more as you'll do? Because I'll be a while.
Probably yes since its nearly 5am here.
The sun is coming up and all that.
Its entirely too hot.
I'll just rain check it till tomorrow or later then xD.
Why did the edgelord end up being my most effective offensive class.
That was the most hilarious death I've ever had.
Fist I charge as rein halfway across temple of anubis hit their rein.
Then their roadhog grapples me their rein charges me.
And we go halfway across the map back where I came.
Last night in WHFRP we almost got eaten by spiders a startled mule ran off a cliff edge and landed on the hafling we were fucked until one of our hired mercenaries whojust got his right arm paralysed rolle *3* Ulric's Fury in a row and ended up with a 34 damage hit from a *shield*.
Last night CA Glenn Mair and Noelor all almost got destroyed by a dragon made out of bone. Sadly Glenn got ridiculously lucky on his regeneration buff and just wouldn't stay down.
We also had an inter-party argument and I left with the mercenaries to find daylight we've been in dwarven tunnels for a week but in end it turned out to be a very long passage just leading to balcony at the top of a mountain.
Hey sometimes dwarves just want to look at the world too.
!note Noelor here lots of things you can colour that are also skeletons.
Here have the Ryuutama PDF because why not.
Not too sure if bullshit or not.
Well that was a game. random heroes got sniper. 11 kills 2 of them actually sniped.
Glenn you should mumble and stop hatin' mairs C.
Now it's sunny I'm spending my lunches drafting my final assignment for uni for this year.
It is very nice outside today.
Part of the inspiration was realising that in Ex3 Nina would have Socialise in caste and therefore alias charms.
Nina would be even more evil in Ex3 Socialise is brutal.
Creation a land where all Noelors are evil.
Cooked_Auto you seen scans of the latest PCG UK anywhere?
Who still plays Heroes.
MoonWolf if the magic armour can be a cloak then P24 Pale mantle of suffering. If it has to be an amour I'll need to look over the other things cos not many armours appealed.
It has to be actually armor.
Yeah spectral armour seems best something I can use to avoid trouble or pursue and so on.
Well that was an experience.
Crossfire of 2 hanzo ultis.
ChaosSmurf Cooked_Auto you seen scans of the latest PCG UK anywhere? - Negatif haven't looked really.
Mastodon pterodactyl etc.
Everyone who doesn't call it total warhammer is doing it wrong.
They're making a new Guyver movie? David Hayter will be delighted.
Jesus christ I must be on the fifth or sixt update for my n7 by now.
BwaS insufficiently sentai poses tbh.
!note MairBear watch this all of it.
Caster on this ESL HS stream pronouncing emperor thor-riss-ee-an. Tilted.
MoonWolf it's so good.
'David Cameron has no intention of withdrawing his claim that Donald Trump was “divisive stupid and wrong” to call for a ban on Muslims entering the US Downing Street has said.' haha.
Has there been a Vampire Masquerade release since Ocotober.
Because Vampire Masquerade was retrademarked in October.
And Vampire bloodlines was trademarked last week.
So I'm wondering if they did something between the two.
Nah I'm listening to the Actiblizz financials.
Anyway yeah I guess V20?
Are you aware of the whole Paradox deal?
Obviously we're writing a story that's like UH.
But I figured asking you guys if anything with masquerade in the title had happened in the last 6 months is faster than googling given how poorly WW advertise.
<- most recent V20 release.
That is from end of last year.
But was Rich laying out how OP and WW were planning to divide labour going forward.
May or may not be relevant.
Oh hey GimleB is playing OW o.
Sure feel sorry for anyone who got phat lewts through OW beta/open beta who'll see it wiped at launch.
Do you feel sorry?
Or do you feel.
Sorry sorry sorry! Sorry!
Well bit of both.
I mean 76 has a green jacket on mine.
Just so you know MairBear people are growing tired of your shit.
Dont you waaa me you mei piece of shit.
Noelor lost you to mumblesplode.
Should have gotten replay there.
I was just explaining that the Giant is cool but also dangerous to their friends.
On account of how huge they are.
People meaning you right?
Or are you with a someone who hates that mei.
Nah people I am playing with.
0003 Oh hey GimleB is playing OW o <---- hahahahaha.
I'm boycotting Blizzard literally last week.
Yeah I was thinking the same.
Apparently one of the parties running here today was the It's Time to Put Newcastle First Party.
GlennCuttlefish I've resisted but I was so tempted to make a halfling for fellowship.
Just so I could be Potato Tato.
Oh yeah thats coming up as well.
I need to read up on that.
Oh I was just doing it with Noelor now... xP.
I've stolen Dragon though.
ChaosSmurf 0003 Oh hey GimleB is playing OW o <---- hahahahaha - What a surprise v.
How to win payload in overwatch be bastion turret up on the payload.
Have an awful enemy team like what Mair had D.
Oh deary me xP Team on a defend mission goes 4 offense heroes 1 sniper and me tanking. Same team we're attacking this time 1 attacker hero till half way then we got a second xP.
Noelor I need help on the wording of one of my things.
Ok that is good timing.
You may have to F5.
I just finished breaking and then fixing the character sheet.
But for the What is a ... Is that mentioned Core Move in addition to what I already have? Or is it just added to the pool of possibilites.
If it says Take a... do it.
Cool cool. So that does give me +1 to moves.
If it says You may... it's adding to your possibilities not giving you one.
Noelor are we both editing the odd capital letters and borked numbers? xD.
Many thanks all the same! 3.
It's because Gnome's put his pdf together weirdly I think.
MairBear what sheets are in your journal rn?
S'where character sheets live.
My sheet and MoonWolf's.
But only can see the bio and info.
Noelor can the tiny dragon on my pog count as my kobold slinger?
Noelor Duke and Mai both have copyright notices on their character images.
Floating next to them.
So far nobody in the party has actual weaponry.
Just supernaturally potent punching.
Friday seems to be becoming my Hero Quest night.
Not finished painting the figures though.
Just doing the heroes.
Why even bother playing without painting them.
I ruined it though RIP me.
I have not consumed enough caffeine to get non-obvious sarcasm yet.
We have shit coffee in the office but I live just across the road from work so I can go home for coffee breaks.
Haha are you really?
Jamie has been getting coffee from for his cafetiere.
Pact coffee is ok not all of their roasts were good when I tried them out.
Yeah they are a little on the dark side.
Noelor I dun goofed my plan I have to take a core first not a custom so instead I'm going for the Heir's tree. And giving us Royal Treatment.
Should be ok with milk though.
People really like dragon champions in this fellowship world I guess?
Finger on the pulse o.
If someone else actually takes the Heir you're an uplifted member of their noble race.
If nobody else does dragons get to occupy some of the narrative space impressive nobles the heir's race would.
Either way you're a big damn deal.
I'm real happy you took dragoon btw.
That sprite does not have nearly anough weird armor or a spear to be a dragoon.
She dragoons with her claws I guess.
That are arbitrarily on fire?
I can use my dragon magic to teleport above them.
And just Dragoons of Nature onto them?
Omg Noelor the Team Rocket overlord custom.
At my folks' clearing out some stuff in my old bedroom.
Found my original DS there was a GBA cart inside.
Obviously the game is Golden Sun.
Could it be anything else.
Yes it could be pokemon.
Minister aside from bonds which will wait untill we actually start 19 Calm Thunder is a finished character.
Also a pokémon game would have been evident from outside due to coloured carts.
I have two pairs of leather gloves.
Speaking of pokemon the café has started selling the new round of Pokemon TCG and is apparently going to start a tourney or something in it P.
MoonWolf I found Baldur's Gate.
Including expansion on a mere 6 CD-ROMs!
It was a big game.
And they hadn't really invented dvd yet.
It does include the rulebook including what is basically an abridged DnD 2nd ruleset.
BG2 is only 4 CDs!
...there is a stick of RAM in here.
They had but drives weren't widespead!
There is no way this is worth keeping.
Didn't go on sale in europe until '98 though!
Couldn't be used as a distribution method yet for long after.
'invented' vs 'available' or 'common'.
Since you couldn't depend on users having it.
MoonWolf there is a map in here.
Map of the Sword Coast region of the Faerûn.
Is Faerûn just elven for Forgotten Realms or something?
Its the name of the continent.
There are different continents.
This map was composed by Elminster and Volothamp apparently.
USB is 20 years old this year.
That reminds me of my Necron Lord.
Omg I found my work experience diary from 2003.
Minister is in personal history land.
Omg I need to keep some of this until Dob logs on.
There's a pamphlet we did for school when we reached 16.
That is like you're no longer legally required to stay in education do you want to?
List 3 jobs that you could do at age 16.
16-year-old Noelor Waiter cashier dotcom entrepreneur.
Fuck off 16-year-old Noelor.
Yeah you were 16 well after the dotcom crash.
Hey if I'd relocated to San Francisco I could be running some sort of sharing economy business!
Oh dear an employment personality test.
Gotta love those ones.
What interests you most - people things or information?
My pie chart was 50% information 33% things 16% people =V.
What about the remaining 1%?
Some muscles in my face around my left eye keep twitching.
I had some yesterday.
Also I take multi-vitamins!
I am winning at health!
Still got muscle twitches though.
Probably due to my sleeping troubles!
People didn't register to vote in time this is the Tories' fault.
Not actually what it says.
Also if they know how those affected would have voted their vote probably wouldn't have mattered in the British farce of an electoral system.
I stopped after the first couple paragraphs.
If the totality of your article contradicts your introduction you're a bad news writer tbh.
Oh god literal nightmare fuel.
D D D.
. Subsequent investigation by forensic pathologists determined Hellevik being exposed to the highest pressure gradient and in the process of moving to secure the inner door was forced through the 60 centimetres 24 in in diameter opening created by the jammed interior trunk door by escaping air and violently dismembered including bisection of the thoracoabdominal cavity.
The 'myths' section here is great.
You have no excuse this time.
I haven't even walked in the past 3 days why are you trying to kill me.
MoonWolf did you take a starting custom?
I think Harbinger gets 1.
I did not realize i got a starting custom.
Let me do that.
It should say below that section's header in the playbook.
MoonWolf how about a quick game or two of overwatch?
Most playbooks let you have two I think Harbinger is 1 and Dragon is... 4?
I want to play but not with random bozos who I dont know if they turn out awful.
I wish to play with people I know to be awful.
You're welcome. Just to be clear that was mostly joking.
Also I dont know if overwatches temperature measurement is off or if I should worry for my computer.
But yesterday it showed my...CPU? GPU? temp as 90c.
I would switch to another computer but I need to find a windows installation disc from somewhere first.
Guess I'll do that once I get a new HD since this one is dying from old age or something.
You know bootable usbs are a thing right ?
Would still need the image file.
Well yes. But as I said not reinstalling windows until I get a new HD since I have to do it soon enough anyway.
So what does our fellowship look like at the moment?
Mair said something about dragons?
Looks like this.
....Was there some kind of special session I just wasn't informed on?
I made mine and mair made his basically in isolution with some help from Noelor.
I started making the roll20 page including html character sheets last night.
Minister you should make it available to everyone.
If you can fix the name its actually really nice.
I heard mair resisted the temptation to make potato tato.
And MoonWolf and Mair independently popped into mumble.
MoonWolf yeah there's a few more tweaks but that's the plan.
I however wont and will instead go with some kind of trilingual word play on this.
I've forked the repository on github so I can pull once I'm happy with it.
And make a halfling called peluna luna.
Minister in theory you could take a custom move to take a custome move to take a custom move basically through all the playbooks >.>.
MoonWolf also I think I mentioned but it is very much an edit of the extant Dungeon World sheet.
It would be very silly.
Can't decide between taking Parry! Counter! Thrust from Heir or Strike True.
But yes if you wanted to play a Mary Sue who is a dwarf raised by elves educated by halflings in harbinger magic also adopted heir to the snake empire or snempire.
MoonWolf Mair has at least one Heir move.
So check with him maybe.
I think he has an Heir core though.
As opposed to custom.
Mair has Royal Treatment.
You don't get a custom.
You get a core.
I really wanted one of those.
Think that was Mair's reaction too =P.
If i take Fast Friends which is umlimted bonds.
Does that mean i get unlimited bonds.
Or am i still too doomed for that ?
Ok I'm about to head home.
So I'll look from my pc.
Noelor nevermind i took Dark and Terrible instead.
Wait are those two your character pogs anyway.
I'm the guy with the flame made out of stone.
Ok. Just making sure before I start filling in this sketch.
Bloody golems coming here and taking our jobs.
GlennCuttlefish superlongname is MoonWolf's Harbinger ie extraplanar fire-angel I think?
Not very into fire conceptually.
Just made out of divine fire shoved into a stone body.
The dragonlady is Mair's... dragon ie dragon-blessed member of some other race probably human.
Oh and the Duke of Roses is the Overlord ie my character and the BBEG.
MoonWolf Flame Immortal is the tattoos option yeah?
>both characters so far are Grace 0.
I'm sure that'll be fine.
<- ooooooooo.
I'm not sure about the Chromie conversion and her DLC skin is totally not my thing.
Medivh however is bang-on from wc3.
MoonWolf btw thanks for inadvertently pointing out I'd not made the dragon's nameplate visible.
GlennCuttlefish you now have a blank character sheet for Peluna Luna.
I dunno Goblin Chromie is kind of adorable.
MoonWolf don't lose games. I need a spectate.
I just wanted 5 paladin wins so i made an agro deck thats only lost.
And it's not pallylock?
Er Pallyloc* Murkadin* Whatever.
Just wanted some quick wins.
MairBear well there you go.
And i cleared my other 2 quests.
Oh hey my second murloc warleader.
Now you can actually make murloc decks.
As d.va run to point press q get play of the game cos enemy is bad.
Wish i could get plays of the game.
MoonWolf have you tried not having fun and playing bastion or Torbjorn?
Well that was tedious. We get to the second point and the enemy just farmed us instead of capturing.
This game DOES NOT CARE.
Even when you take aways people kill / death / assist scorebaord they still act like idiots.
Objective time 0001 and that was only cos of symmetra's teleporter.
Still get gold medal on it o.o.
Nobody was doing their jobs.
The torbjorn managed to get scared into putting the trap 1 metre from the spawn because one exit was camped |.
Read we made some tweaks to the servers we'd really like to test.
Omg I have quit 4 games in a row now because I keep getting put on attack teams with 2 snipers and 2 other defenders.
MairBear apologies if you already answered this but can Dragons the big ones not champions fly?
Also are they big western style winged dragons.
Or asian serpenty one.
I love that dumb twitter.
50% of the Sources of Power in this Fellowship game will be places unless I add a bunch more for some reason.
Pretty okay with this.
Means the Overlord will end up recruiting generals to protect them.
Minister Dragons can fly yes even champions I just don't have it unlocked yet.
MairBear yesterday on offense we had a trollbjorn in our team who did absolutely nothing the whole game.
Then on the final seconds when we were just losing the game he overcame his demons.
Not even make a turret ?
And built a turret.
In the middle of the capture point.
A credit to team.
No one in this game knows what to do when reinhardt puts up a shield and starts moving.
Reinhardt...shield? I'm not sure I folloow.
Pretty sure he has that firehammer stun ulti and charge.
Cant remember any shields sure its not zarya's?
Blizzard could have made that card!
And it's purple! it fits warlock perfectly!
Nono it made a warlock card.
Then my renderer rendered a warlock card.
The generator purely does text.
Fuckin' login to facebook and see David Attenborough trending get a moment of panic before I see it text below saying celebrating his 90th birthday.
I had that in Glasgow the other week. some building off the main street with a rotating news ticker had ... Tom Jones dies.
This afternoon I wrote a bunch of stuff about dwarves and the Eternal City.
It's looking like all the races in this world are pretty drastically different.
So if orcs do show up they'll be shrooms.
They'll be written and portrayed by me.
Sniggering at gimble's latest post on fb right now.
!note MairBear you should probably name lizardland btw.
Mu I was on wikipedia and just trying to puzzle out the closest word that it showed in political subcategories to reach what I wanted.
I nearly went with a Theocracy but I didn't want to sping the idea of a dragon church on you due to how messy that can make things.
I thought you'd majorly fucked democract.
Hah xD No worries.
You can expect any cities I have to name to be as serious and longwinded as the capitol though >.>.
I meant the nation as a whole.
And we shall call this land..... This Land!
I'll consider a name...
How was your weekend? trying?
Anathema had listen to hints about 'preparing for the future' when we buy an apartment.
Enraged me to no end.
But I let Simon do the talking.
Otherwise I would've offended them.
At least they are gone now?
Anathema yeah they flew out early this morning.
I hate trying to sleep in summer.
I'm basically sleep deprived all summer.
Was planning on getting up at 630 to go to the gym today but didn't sleep well I don't even remember my 630 alarm actually woke up at 740ish from a notification on my phone.
MairBear MoonWolf let me know if/when you're going to stone hearths so I can watch you please?
What's Get Down actually called?
Apparantly the aircon at work has 3 settings heat cool and auto and the engineers said you dont want to use auto on a room this size ...
It'd be way to cold for you.
And way too warm for Mx Smith in the other corner.
He actually had uh.
Summoned minions set to 1HP.
Which I triggered with my Big Tree because I cannot remember all the secrets =V.
Noelor but it's way too warm for me now.
Anathema sleep with ice cubes.
Noelor i shall attempt to fish you a win.
I'm just putting the kettle on.
No work today ?
What is up with your portrait?
Are those vines because you're in wild or tentacles because old gods?
Also because spectate mode is good and fine I see you as simultaneously ranks 17 and 19.
Noelor its because my wild rank is my higher rnak.
Noelor there you go.
Pretty cool win too tbh.
Fandral is great if he sticks.
I am a fan of Fandral yeah.
You just murder wtih tempo.
Ftrbzzs I may get a fan.
Anathema might be worth it yeah.
Anathema if your employer has a HS team try and persuade them to buy you one.
It should fall under wellbeing.
Ha ha wellbeing at anathema's workplace? joke of the year!
Also if it's actually affecting your health and they say no to you in writing you can report it to the HSE.
I meant a fan for home they would not buy me a fan for work.
I'd rather get a proper desk.
This wavy bullshit is annoyinhg.
The desks are curved such that when they are lined up they are a very low frequency low amplitude sine wave.
Because it looks nice I guess?
Fucking annoying to line up my screens and chair though wondering if this is why my neck hurts etc.
The desk is too high as well I feel but it isn't adjustable.
My elbows are at an acute angle unless I tilt the chair so far forward I can't use the backrest.
Adjust your chair ?
It doesn't go any higher.
And if it it did my feet would be off the ground.
So it's either no backrest or feet off the ground and too-bent elbows.
We aren't a big enough company to have a dedicate HS person either it's just something HR do.
If they tell you no in writing you can go to the HSE.
If they're causing ill health.
Well I'm hoping to see the doctor today about neck / shoulder so we'll see what they say.
It's possible I just hurt myself exercising.
Wouldn't be the first time.
OTOH the internet says things like Your wrists should be straight when using a keyboard. Keep your elbows vertical under your shoulder and right by your side.
And that is literally impossible for me.
Okay thats just wrong.
Since my shoulders are wider than the keyboard.
Okay the elbows thing sure.
Should basically be straight.
Everything is the perfect height at my standing desk at home.
A second person at work has asked for a link to my food-drink.
Excellent lawn mowing weather.
I love that he's just like.
I mean that just seems made up.
Or technically true because it doesn't say it happens at no other time?
Welcome to internet facts.
No sources not nuance no explenation.
Here is a fact it might not be a fact you can't tell.
Thanks for the carte blanche on inventing random cities with chinese names.
Better start practicing our chinese inflections.
MoonWolf I'll just enjoy making noelor cringe with every horrible mispronounciation.
GlennCuttlefish that's actually fine.
I think Mair agreed that Mei would get mad IC at mis-pronunciations.
I decided ahead of time to just not care.
I don't think she's overly gonna be mad but will probably react.
Puff her cheeks and stare indigniantly.
Also in this book the fantasy word for bagpipes are to music what warthogs are to mathematics. Largely unconnected.
That is pretty Pratchett-esque.
MairBear do you have a name in mind for that ancient dragon who recently died and left behind a very powerful soulgem?
If not I'm thinking 日龙.
Dammit hexchat how is 龙 not in your unicode base.
Going to assume one of those character is dragon.
The one I can't read yes.
Day dragon according to google translate unsure which kind of day.
Is the first one of those characters actually a boxy 8 or is that not rendering?
I can see the second one.
Anathema 日 is a box with a line in the middle yes.
The legs are sticking out too.
MoonWolf only slightly and depending on font maybe not at all?
There's not really such a thing as a box without legs in hanzi because of stroke order.
You need to do downward strokes first then fill in the bottom.
And caligraphy fancy strokes so no neatly closing the box.
Noelor 日龙 is fine.
I'll let you spin it how you want but my original headcanon was that he was about to die and so was clinging on to life to try and find someone to give the soulgem to.
I was only thinking that the archipelago used chinese stuff though dragons all over are probably some other ancient thing.
Cultures tend to be regional not racial.
But with that scenario in mind the trickster dragon could be a possible way to influence the dragon's decision about who to give it to.
Please name that trickster as well btw.
Even if you just take the Metzen route and call them Lon'kir.
Also yeah the architecture and make up of lizardland cities is definitely fantasy. Was not really planning to base that on any Earthly culture at all.
GlennCuddlefish .... I have an idea that I need Finnish language for.
He Who Stole The Fire.
I finish moving the lawn and then I realize I forgot to put a can of soda in the freezer drat.
Guess you'll have to drink warm soda then.
Of course no I put it in now and then just go and take a shower.
MairBear I can't find that wu in my dictionary.
Ok I got it on google.
Dunno if this link will work properly.
You can see that the simplified character is way different.
That has to be the most drastic difference between a traditional and simplified character I've seen.
It's usually more like.
MairBear so silent fishing town?
It wasn't always a big city.
Mind if I PM?
HOW DARE YOU EVEN SUGGEST SUCH A THING YOU COMMON PEASANT.
So lately I have noticed that 1 Mei is annoying as hell when against you and 2 Mccree to stronk.
GlennCuddlefish every day is mei day.
The Roll20 now has a world map.
It took way too long to find a world generator that would give me more than one continent.
Noelor T�m�persl�pi is the trickster's name.
Great now I get to pronounce Glenn's language wrong too.
Hey mairbear want to play some overwatch as an asshole duo.
I'm thinking mercy and farah here.
Can we make it an asshole trio ?
Noelor want to join me and GlennCuddlefish and make an asshole trio?
Get on mumble and for the love of gods communicate what you see P.
My push to talk is fucked for some reason tyring to fix it.
How long is this beta thing going on for?
Guess I'm not playing Overwatch then p.
Noelor they gave it +24 hours.
Or is that included.
Could be tomorrow yeah.
I need help deciding between sprays.
Why did anyone think this was a good idea?
MoonWolf maybe patternspider can warn people of bad weather in their area?
MairBear <- i'm just going to assume it means while in your hand.
Would just be UK though.
Maybe I'll do it then.
<- damnit RNN that last word ruined a perfectly good card.
<- the name makes no sense but its a real card that could work.
Hooray got a doctor's appointment.
Sorry sorry I'm sorry sorry.
Well you got back earlier than I did.
<- Taunt. Deathrattle Destroy your opponent's health. BALANCED.
You can all just weather another nick.
Would show your weather.
My weather is the warmest.
Where the fuck is gimbleb living.
Might have been a bit south of Edinburgh when he last checked in though?
Pretty sure still Glasgow.
Taps aff in glesga.
Well my mumble is fucked.
I was messing about with the spectator stuff.
And then you inv'd me and then I finished and someone else inv'd me and I was like hrk.
According to the doctor I have pulled a trapezius.
Ah big muscle group in the back?
Muscle in the back of the neck / shoulder.
The small one that makes serious weightlifters look like they ahve no neck.
Did you get physio?
'gorge on ibuprofen for a week and stretch' is the recommendation.
Physio might not be a bad idea though.
Maybe you should go for one with your company insurance?
I'll see how it goes in a couple of weeks I'd going to keep trying this 'yoga for weightlifters' and see if that helps.
I also want to get more flexible.
The dream be able to touch my toes p.
It's a good dream -.
Says miss 'casually put my whole palm on the floor' |.
I need to get a PS4 so I can get the latest Earth Defence Force game...
Hey it's not as easy as it used to be!
Even I need to stretch these days.
Dun dun dun.
Bring in the popcorn.
I serve a higher authority said the man. There's a judge that is higher than you.
That may be but so far he hasn't communicated with me said Alsup. The juror was dismissed.
Fucking that guy KNOWS ABOUT COMPUTERS.
He might knwo what we are talking about.
I thought they were founding a jury not a senate.
Today in weird science.
Kid finds out maya cities are built based on CONSTELLATIONS of stars like you expect in fantasy.
Predicts another city locaiton based on missing city in constellation.
Kids! With their logical reasoning!
Using up all the discoveries.
Things are getting incredibly recursive.
MairBear fine don't say anything.
Eurovision semi-final 1 at the top of the hour if anyone cares for it.
GlennCuttlefish beta just closed.
What will I do with my life now.
Well I got a GTX 560 from a friend now. minor upgrade from 460 wonder if my MB has a second 16x slot so I could do something with that card.
Of course if my MB does have a second 16x slot I could try using the 460 in SLI and see what happens.
With another 460 of course.
I was about to say.
That only works with identical cards.
Featuring such amazing characters as buff uncomfortably sexy ocean.
MoonWolf does PatternSpider run in less than 480MB of RAM? p.
Thats a good question thats hard to awnser in win 10.
Without the chatterbot yes.
There is enough capacity on the nishkriya VM then.
MoonWolf stuff like this is what I mean by horrible netcode.
Not tired today.
Wow he missed the obvious Dr Boom reference.
Typical trollborn POTG.
The dangers of choke points.
This week in Star Wars Edge of the Old Republic.
That screen is so big I had to zoom out almost as much as possible to get it all.
Looks like somebody' getting fucked.
Yeah us we're the tiny sheep in between the Republican and Sith destroyers.
No wait The Republic the Sith and the unknown third part as I can't ID the last ship.
Someone didn't read the weather forecast for today HEAVY SHOWERS OF TURBOLASERS.
Nvm just Republic versus Sith battle we managed to jump into.
The rites are pressingup in the console and then enter.
The Omnissiah isn't very pleased.
I hate doing this at this late moment. But i'm cancelling tonights game.
What I had planned / worked out earlier for an encounter isn't going to work and I don't have time to make something better.
MairBear I tried to do something too complex.
It was math wasn't it.
I warned you about math.
And there isn't even Overwatch to compensate =<.
GlennCuttlefish math was involved its involved in every encounter though.
I mean Overwatch being down isn't your fault.
Orrr is it? �_�.
Nah I fucked it.
But no gaming is better than bad gaming.
This is a cool comic.
Noelor i did not see incompetent link coming.
It's just kid Rinku.
Just had a 47 minute game on garden of fucking terror. This is why that map gets banned out!
MairBear todays brawl is.
... oh my word this will be fun.
Or get the legendary dragon synergies even if you have only a third of the recommended dragon cards.
BwaS okay get this Astral Communion Y'Shaarj Rage Unbound.
I don't actually have the Y'shaarj for that.
But i'd play that.
Yeh just saw that on the twits.
Well they said innervate since it's half and half.
But if the only cards in your deck are Y'shaarj.
It doesn't really matter that you throw your hand out.
Hmmm timber wolves OTK.
You just need one draw.
Or get t his.
Tree if life and something else.
If you can get to that mana.
These decks are going to be pretty fast i think.
Fandral and raven idol.
If only you had a way to cheat out a 10 mana minion.
This panel is great.
I look forward to never watching it.
Dob work decided to do an Involvement thing over Eurovision this week.
Decorate your team's area based on a randomly-assigned nation!
The nations were assigned on Monday.
My team leader did the organising.
A lot of people came over to him today upset that their countries aren't even going to be in the final.
Who was unlucky to get greece san marino iceland then.
Those the only not qualified can think off top of head.
San Marino and uh.
Bosnia is multi-word I guess.
They played last night I think.
Cant recall them getting through.
Russia's been stuck in my head all day.
Hmm sc2 and xpacks on sale this week lotv on like a third off.
Dob I just know our team got Croatia.
*youtubes* oh yeh rita repulsa this one.
Got nuttin on cyprus tho.
Ok innervate-boom is not gonna get this against alarmobot yshaarj.
A winning Top 2 murloc tidehunter everyfin is awesome.
Innervate coldlight oracle is milling the fuck out of me.
Desert camel timber wolf won though.
Put us both in fatigue turn 5.
Flametongue totem primal fusion won on turn 2 to a mage with knife juggler I'm not sure what else.
Man internet dating is fucking depressing.
Hence why I'll never bother.
Ice block fireball mage. Ran out of iceblocks.
BwaS my soulfire fist of jarraxus deck is obscene.
Not quit infinete mechs good.
Fist is finally a good card!
Om nom porridge with actual blueberries instead of jam for breakfast.
Anathema you'll get some proper blueberries when you come visit.
None of those French bush grown blueberries.
I'll have you know these blueberries are from spain!
Anathema they all taste the same French or Spanish -P.
And finnish ones taste different somehow? p.
Smaller and more delicious.
Proper forest grown none of this greenhouse farmed bush berries.
Nice weather is over.
Meanwhile my phone app says 19C tomorrow v.
I love the 'App Development and Condiments' episode of Community.
Noelor So this arrived to the boardgame café today P.
Thats a lot of pokemon.
One of the guys running the place is the main drive for it and is apparently planning to run a tournament too.
Fun fact language was actually invented for the sole purpose of dispelling the myth that exercising your abs would burn stomach fat there are hundreds of cave paintings of fat guys doing crunches all across the globe.
Tonight I made some... not cookies.
They have jam in them.
Only two spilt jam out onto the baking tray!
2 out of ?
Argh when is Steven Universe.
Probably up when you wake up ?
Why does this site have the page that will host it currently hosting a teaser the thumbnail for which is a spoiler.
This sort of suffering is why theology exists.
Stupid just realised how close that's getting released to overwatch >C.
What? Nothing wrong with something strangely morbid yet fascinating.
I don't know that morbid is right.
It just struck me as... weird.
Sadly it seems like the guy with the wolves won't be showing up at ESC.
The aussie entry got through though.
The furry was /weird/ and I know weird eurovish.
Nika Kocharov and the Young Georgian Lolitaz v.
Yeh my retina's still scarred from georgia.
The Croatian alphabet includes the letter �.
This is similar to a sh sound in English.
It also puts the same diacritic on Z.
Which has a similar effect on that consonant.
I have no way of representing it in English because that consonant basically doesn't exist for us =V.
All I saw was.
I just assume its lacking font support in my case.
Appares on S and Z.
Or maybe ?
Is this you revising for saturday?
Reading around for tomorrow.
Really strange boredom to send you to croatian wiktionary.
It's Noelor what do you expect?
Trust me they never used to be like this...
The diacritic moves the consonants up the mouth a little!
Times change Dob. Times. Change.
But it still comes around to an Archimonde end boss fight in the end.
Language is fantastic.
Why did I start trying to familiarise myself with IPA.
My mouth now feels alien.
Eg tuna because english is awful is pronounced tjuːnə the j is pronounced as J is in almost all non-English European languages the ə is the generic english vowel.
Actually due to yod-dropping I pronounce it nearer to tʃuːnə ʃ is a sh-sound.
And I hadn't noticed until I read that yod-dropping was a thing!
The fuck is yod dropping.
I wasn't even looking at an article on yod I was reading about rhotism and R as a sandhi!
Yod is a name for that j consonant.
That makes it more obvious to English-speakers which consonant it is.
Also not dropping sorry coalesence.
It's to do with the tongue.
And people being lazy with how far they move it.
We don't have time to be prounouncing everything all the time.
We don't have time to be prounouncing everything all the time <- you might be joking.
But that is 90% of my accent.
You need a better accent.
Try pronouncing literally everything.
Bah. I just can't get the feet right on this pog. Might have to redo that part next week.
<- a fake real lucio album.
No JSRF refrences 7/10.
Somehow I never did properly come to grips with lucio. It just felt like I wasn't doing anything useful.
It works for me ?
That gun is annoying because of its burst nature and slow projectiles.
But they do Hurt.
And the knockback is great.
Sure But I just didn't get the feeling I was actually supporting my team.
I must have been since we often won but still.
I think my healer preferences atm are Mercy -> Zeny -> Lucio.
Thats fine i'll just play the lucio.
Also those speed boosts shouldn't be underestimated.
Mercy for pure healing Zeny for insane damage For support and decent heals.
Yeah that was the most useful part for me.
I love it if we can take a point well and then just press speed boost rush the next point and Break It Down.
As in as a winning play.
Not the stupid phrase nobody uses anymore.
Man I swore I wouldn't pre-order this game.
Since I can't afford it.
But...Guess I can wait for a new hard drives for a month or two more.
If you pre-order it.
I have no excuse.
Get your unreasonable friends to buy it ?
I dont think any of them are buying it.
MairBear You're going to do it anyway.
Just as I will.
<- oh no big bad captain is sad also has gay parents.
<- Someone make a finnish version where the waifu rather drown herself than be with you.
I suspect I need a better monitor at some point.
On the screen I use to draw I see this colour as red on my game monitor its muddled orange.
There are programs to help you calibrate monitors.
I dont think any amount of calibrating will help with this POS monitor.
It was the cheapest monitor I could find in an emergency years ago.
I want to run a modern day occult game where Cash4Gold companies are actually all a front for a greedy dragon.
Thats rather ingenious.
<- holy shit polygon are TERRIBLE.
's pretty shit on the whole GlennCuttlefish.
I play better than that when I'm drinking tea with one hand.
And you drink tea with the wrong hand.
I often use the left.
Well I'm out should be back by our usual starting time at the latest.
SunTiger shadowbomber light of the naaru.
That sounds pretty decent.
SunTiger wild growth yogg.
I should try t hat.
I should try that i say.
I play 6 games.
Concede all 6 games turn 1.
Because ther eisn't any slow decks anymore.
I went vs an innervate raven idol.
Who must have been life-coach on a slow.
MairBear yeah wild growth is SOO SLOOW.
You need to live 3 turns with good draws for it to even get to 10 mana.
Am I a monster SunTiger ?
I'm fine with this.
In fact I'm all for it.
Ship all the overwatches.
Torbjorn x Bastion OTP.
I will fight you.
Bastion x D.Va's mech.
Hey thats racist against zenyata.
That... may or may not count as robot.
Nvm i was mistaken.
Bastion is an omnic too.
Not all omnics look are humanoid or have the wierd eyes thing going i guess.
You know what overwatch needs ?
Another play of the game type.
Minion lanes with towers?
So if you set up a big graviton surge or blizzard and genji steals all the kills.
You both get to be in the play of the game.
Instead of just genji.
I got another piercing.
Anathema are you symmetrical nwo ?
I was now I am asymmetrical again so I can sleep on one side.
Game still on noelor ?
50% of conversations while my parents are visiting is complaints about my sister being awful.
I did 18k steps today o_0.
Lost connection did i get an answer.
Sorry I wasn't home yet first time and then didn't see you log back in.
K. heading home in bout a hour.
GlennCuttlefish what the shit.
Just saw your link from an hour ago in mumble.
This is my second favorite gif of all time.
Counter Bass with Hans Gen or Widow is one thing small problem is the skill floor of the first two is a fucking ceiling and the third is french.
Noelor> yeh seen it.
SunTiger the second Choose a custom for halflings is actually Choose another custom or a second 'What is a Halfling?' option.
I must have missed that.
While that one is good I still think this slip up is better.
So how many people have gotten angry that doom-guy ripped off master chiefs armor ?
Yeah I'm A-OK with this ship.
HEROES NEVER DIE Noelor.
Justice reigns from above until 0.1 secs later when Hans headshots her with an arrow flying 2yds beneath her foot.
Justice rains from uh-buuuuhhh ragdoll thud.
I don't even get to the r.
JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE! Time to raise my APM.
Justice raises from apm?
And 2 yds away a rocket-boosted crusader slams through the screen catching nobody and falling off the next cliff.
I know the matchmaking is bad and puts you with in every game but I get more phonics out than that.
There is also the elusive JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE.
Follow by no killfeed entries.
Or any indication of where it even happened.
Shit I meant to press E.
Noelor btw mei's poem ?
I looked it up A sudden evening breeze brings thousands of pear tree blooms.
I am really dreadful with pharah's E.
And if you're like but why does she say that.
Apparantly its an allegory for the first snow of the year.
Which is why she uses that poem on voslkaya.
Noelor i didn't think we'd ever see more watermelon stevens.
Dob I rebound it to r-click.
Hmm I can see that.
My UT muscle memory gets the better of me with Rclick on a rawket lawnchair.
Yeah it supposed to queue up rockets to fire 3 or 6 at once.
I summoned it it cost Brawl.
The only other minion was a 2/2 on my side.
So I did nothing with that 5 mana.
Thats what you get with random spells.
Luci�'s album is on vinyl.
Because of course it is.
Even in the robot future vinyl is the best medium for true audiophiles Noelor.
Have a thing.
A steven universe thing.
WHy did this commentator do a LiquidHearth.
Why is this guy playing shifting shade? It's just a 4/3 with a half thoughtsteal.
Yes... and this is bad?
As was explained to him in detail.
Thank crap kibler is on the board xD.
Pretty sure I've had more alcohol in the past few days than the past 3 months combined.
Noelor Perfect timing on that tweet btw as one of my EU friends on skype just goes WHO'S READY FOR SOME Y U R O V I S I O N P.
In a channel with mostly Americans P.
And she has been drinking. Hooooo boy.
But we still have those political disagreements after.
And the songs are better than glee.
So I just noticed I had forgotten my exalted campaigns map on the table during a drinking/games night with friends.
A newly added kingdom is red lobster.
...And Mexitax Lowtax and Notax.
Note to self Hide my maps during drinking nights.
Mexitax and Notax better watch out because the goons will get them.
MoonWolf Evolve + thing from below is pretty fun.
Boris Johnson The EU wants a superstate just as Hitler did.
Thats what the eu is.
Which never once had a superstate.
You just HATE imperialism.
Basically allergic to it.
Thread of the week from the soccer subreddit.
Most orchestras are just 1800's cover bands. haha.
MoonWolf want to win a HS game?
MairBear enjoy your dust.
MoonWolf what should I put in with Undercity Huckster for brawl.
I just really wanna sell funnel cakes.
Prep for spells ?
Body on the board that makes my hero power better!
Vendor* for maximum funnel cake?
I love the idea of it but it throws my chances to win.
Like I don't get enough OW stuff from v and vg v.
Hopefully not too much rain tomorrow. Need to mow the lawn so.
Thread-ball planet KLK-X Oh I see what you did there Luluco.
Some Kind of Space Fraud!
Nice UI in a paradox game for once but seems to be way less going on than in things like CK2 much bigger focus on empire building.
It's oddly engaging though I played for 6 hours without a break at a standing desk.
So its a 4x then.
It has space-combat much more multi-player friendly than Endless Space too.
May be because I'm still new but I don't really see much difference between the factions although I love that they are randomly generated for your map.
Hello my adorable daughter. I have come late again but I bring gifts as tribute to calm your wrath. Behold A BOY I FOUND.
This game is off to a start.
Also if you already haven't you should see Space Patrol Luluco.
I did see it. Unified trigger universe theory confirmed.
Daaaad why is this boy still alive!
Why did you bring him here anyway? Is he an illi-jit-mate child or something? Did you betray mom? I like this girl and I am not even 2 minutes in the game.
Started Legend of heroes Trails in the sky.
!note MairBear you know sheep a bit wooly. ITS WOOL!
What kind of a J-RPG is this supposed to be.
GlennCuttlefish one with trails.
I've been to every bedroom in this town and didn't find anything to steal.
So far its been the opposite of terrible Other than not finding loot.
Nonono you didn't find anything worth to steal.
Your character is extra picky.
Welp I tired but it actually started to rain when I began mowing so.
Would you believe I made the same spelling mistake on two separate messages?
My foxhound unit name generator was not prepared for double animal names.
That's the main character in ZoE2.
Man I just love bosses that self destruct.
“The future is ziggurats” Samyazaz was telling Ut-Naparash as they walked up the Great Stair. “In a hundred years nobody’s going to remember pyramids. Pyramids are a flash in the pan. Ziggurats are for the ages.”.
!note Noelor rl tracer.
Overwatch short about genji and hanzo.
<- its not that they were successful they were just the only ones not tax ev..I mean tax planning.
And it GROWS BACK.
Fact some dogs also have wool.
MairBear you jammy bastard you!
Next you'll be telling me those lambs they have.
Are made of lamb!
But thats not part of the skit.
Also I read note from you to MairBear as from MairBear to you but.
I thought the notes were pretty clear about direction.
Yeah but I'd only just got in and sat down.
And easy to watch?
I am so glad I didn't play till open beta I only now realise how much omg why are the beta servers not back yet you had to go through.
And now we know why hanamura's wall scroll and lamp are fucked up.
Doesn't really explain why we want to controll points though.
Why did I watch this.
Why cant overwatch be out.
Why is the world full of injustice?
Because widowmaker kept shooting down pharahs.
Still waiting for the Mercy or Pharah one.
Is there not just one more to go?
I think one more announced?
I don't think they plan to stop.
Waiting on the dub of dragons to add the ryu ga waka teki go f yourself.
Oh sort of like TF2's Meet the X series.
MairBear yes but prettier.
MoonWolf now see here.
Sniper's a good job mate.
The meet the x series was FINE.
But valve even with its fancy movie maker wil never be the blizzard animation department.
That place is fucking lengendary.
From what I made out of the one trailer we're missing a soldier genericy-4 trailer to go?
I believe the preferred adage is Epic MoonWolf.
Noelor look we wore Epic down.
Everything is epic these days.
You do a leveling quest in wow you get epics.
Legendary wait for it dary?
They don't even make epic weapons in the next wow expansion d ungeons anymore.
Like most problems in the world this is America's fault p.
Nah I blame the Uk because they let their colonies go unchecked.
At some point in every parent's life they have to let their child go and make their own mistakes.
I hope Commander Shepard I mean Jane Lynch is in it again.
Cooked_Auto something something Finland?
I think Meet the X was fine but delaying out Pyro to make it a gigantic climax kinda jumped the shark.
Pyro was garb true.
Mei's should just be her Winston and Symmetra.
At least we got expiration date.
Nerding all over the camera.
Noelor designing a device that can teleport snowballs.
I'd send Mei to the Alps or something.
I think the latest comic confirmed Symmetra as autistic?
BwaS so far all the shorts have been set in or around existing maps.
So mei would be on ... volskaya ?
There's that Himalayan map.
Numbani where she complains of the heat.
Noelor can you link that comic ?
If you go there with her and Tracer.
No ski slopes though.
I may be over-reading.
That should not involve sighing.
Fuuuuck thought I'd turned on the back hob to boil some water actually turned on the front one...which had a wooden spoon sitting on it.
Noelor well it has a direct reference to the spectrum and her inner monologue may or may not be autism spectrum its a bit off though.
Got Something going on.
With things being Orderly.
Or not.
That was sort of my takeaway.
The comics are real short though.
But I dunno what other spectrum she would be referring to.
Similar to the thing with reinhart.
Is that just the artist being inventive with the idea of reinhardt having a very active imagination.
I missed Reinhardt's thing.
Or is he just half delusional.
I read it as active imagination.
I've seen others argue the other angle.
Whether that has some deeper issue to it.
I guess I'd expect at least a little more reference to it?
Reinhard is just very german.
Considering he likes David Hasslehof music and bratwursts.
Some kind of wurst at least.
Cooked_Auto he likes The Classics.
Liking Hasselhoff's music is incredibly german.
But not exclusivly so!
It is the one thing he's named as an example.
Someone set Janos off talking about Animorphs again.
Just go play an all lunars campaign.
They only had the one expansion on the K$?
Yes the original kickstarter had an expansion built into it.
But only the one.
Eventually they split that up into two seperate releases.
For a few reasons.
Including marketing timeing for when you should have more content for sale for your game bullshit.
Wasn't sure if they'd stretchgoaled themselves into infinite expansions.
Stretchgoals only added more content to the game itself.
Ex2 is currently a conversation about bread.
There was no romance.
They explicitly said they were not going to write romances.
Not that it makes waifus impossible.
No one can stop the waifuing.
Noelor plenty of people probably a serious fraction women lamented the lack of romances.
Swayer is noted for disliking romances being a central part of games.
Yes but. get this.
Even as person in charge.
He doesn't get to make fuck his dream game.
But damn if he's not going to try.
Get to make fuck his dream.
Sorryk i was going to throw in a reference to the old SA forum thread title.
But forgot the quote.
Then did not completly delete it >.>.
I forgot to include room for a carbohydrate source in my weekly lunches.
I did get the reference yeah.
Anathema just boil some rice.
There is no room in my tupperware!
They are filled with vegetables.
Fuck you suck my dick josh saywer dream experience.
Anathema take out a few of the vegetables.
Then put in carbs.
2 pieces of salmon 70g green beans 90g asparagus 140g brocolli.
Cut your brocolli in half its a garbage vegetable and also space inefficient.
Green beans are disgusting and should be thrown into the sun.
I have a thing against beans not a fan of them.
Asparagus is also not great.
Ok I can't find a source that doesn't sound like new-age hippie bullshit.
What i'm saying is that all your veggies are bad.
Brocolli is very nutritious.
Eat some of those.
Yeah get colour veggies instead of glorified leaves.
I eat a carrot with every dinner.
Who the fuck been dissin ma boi broccoli.
BwaS me what are you going to do about it.
Get outta here with your edible baby trees Dob.
Get some red cabbage slice that shit. get an apple slice that shit.
Toss there you go.
Why *wouldn't* you want edible baby trees?
That's the best bit about them.
Pretending to be a giant.
MoonWolf you like weird food.
Apples with red cabbage wtf?
And I say this as someone who had raisins in scrambled eggs once.
The best slaw I ever ate has apples.
Anathema okay google that.
Its uhm actually a legit combination.
Not some weird bullshit i made up.
Apples are too sweet.
Red cabbage needs some sweetness.
Tartness helps bring out the red.
Also right more weir stuff.
Get some leek slice that stuff fine.
Heat up a wok wok the SHIT out of it. add just a bit of vegetable stock then add honey and mustard.
If you get your ratios right the mustard will bind the fluid.
Shredded leek is pretty good it's true.
Haven't had it with mustard.
Can't recommend it if you dislike honey and mustard as a concept.
Depends on the ratio.
I like a hint of mustard to help out something otherwise bland like mashed potato.
I don't like things to actively taste of mustard.
Honey helps though so.
Probably not for you then ?
Thats barely a food.
My tea was a bertrand shake.
This is more of a food than that.
I don't know what that is.
...Mashed potatoes? Bland? What kind of bizzarro potatoes are you eating.
The nutrient shake ana and I eat.
Oh one of those soylent-likes.
MoonWolf except made with real food!
GlennCuttlefish ones in england that got boiled maybe a bit too much and not seasoned.
P sure mustard counts as seasoning.
They have a sport option now that has more protein I am looking forward to trying it out once I finish my current supply.
Noelor do the brits take their mashed potatoes with or without skin ?
Even on new harvest potatoes.
Though to be fair.
Mashing those is a crime.
Keeping skin on potatoes other than jackets is a new and bizarre concept to English cuisine.
Ok yeah actualy except new potatoes too.
And yeah you wouldn't mash those.
Yeah you eat em with a bit of mustard.
Boiled in the skin.
Man I want mashed potatoes now.
What texture is dutch mustard?
Pity I dont have neither proper potatoes for it or whole milk.
MoonWolf what kind of mustard?
Uhm well refering to a province in my country isn't going to help.
Because here wholemeal is English mustard and smooth is French or Dijon mustard.
But thats a personal preference.
Noelor traditional dutch mustards are almost all wholemeal that word sounds wrong for mustard.
We use smooth and uhm.
Coarse i guess ?
Anathema holy shit indeed.
<- the actual mustard i prefer on my potatoes.
We have smooth in the house as well for things that need smooth.
Also its not just me right that whenever i see what americans call mustard it looks disgusting ?
Its nto supposed to be that... fluid.
Can't wrap my head around mustard on potatotes. Potatoes are too pure for that.
Its pretty good ?
You don't slather them in it.
Just a little bit.
I'm just pretty omni anti mustard fight me.
You are a monster.
Mustard has its uses but on the whole I'm not a fan.
MoonWolf yeah looks like what'd be called English mustard here.
Its weird to me you just call it english.
We have like a mustard per province.
You can't pretend it's surprising.
I can because mustard is one of those super regional products.
I could go to the butcher here and ask for frisian worst as opposed to say groningse or gelderse and he'd probably tell me has got three different styles of THOSE.
I'm translating frisian because for Reasons that has a word in english.
But the other provinces don't have english adjectives.
I might actually be mistaken as to what English mustard it.
I'm not joking about the sausage thing by the way the local butcher who is our neighbour has fucking prices for his dried smoked frisian sausages.
Noelor thats fairly smooth as mustards go.
Like not dijon smooth but pretty smooth no seed casing in sight.
About bloody time.
Anyway sausages are the same here.
Fuck it tomorrows dinner decided.
Mashed potatotes and blue cheese stuffed meatballs.
I should make cheese stuffed meatballs.
Blue cheese won't work nobody but me would like it.
Blistered my thumb making caramel popcorn just now.
Like the tiniest drop.
One day I'll create non-stick popcorn.
That you can eat without it sticking to your teeth.
I rolled 3 for Join Batttle.
Let's see if Brawl is still up.
Let's see if I can get a win with this Reno warrior.
I don't know if I really get this deck yet.
Bloodsail Cultist is a Splatoon.
In keeping with the YEAR OF THE KRAKEN.
I think there is going to be a pirate expansion coming.
Or at least a subtheme of prates in all of them.
I'm ok with this.
Of all the tribes hearthstone has pirates is probably my favourite.
Cooked_Auto new feinne lp is up disgaea d2.
Neat might check it out.
Skipped the previous one so.
Oh god this music.
I love this music so much.
Brawl destroyed all 7 of my opponents' minions namely 4 patrons 2 slimes and a berserker.
I love it that I have to teach my brother how to work an android tablet because he's so used to iOS 3c.
My own surviving minion was a 7/7.
Noelor well yeah i would probably concede that too.
But it happened and we both Astonishing'd then they conceded.
Shoulda packed a BGH Kappa.
Dob could you uh.
Hm I should start checking the Arkham Knight LP now that I've watched through the other two games.
Oooor I could watch geop stumble through Dark Souls 2 v.
Noelor how goes combat ?
It actually finished just as I was hitting find game.
We're now talking to elementals.
There's a zerg player from this wknd's dreamhack vods named Scarlett. Tilting me that she's not put in red in all her games.
Noelor lolito has a strong ship-name.
Got to give credit for that.
Lolito isn't the ship name.
It's the title of the conceptual fic that would be written.
The ship would be like.
Well time to finally get a SIM card for my android.
PS How can this show have both the best husbando and best waifu of this season.
Is I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying back?
Cooked_Auto / MoonWolf don't suppose you know the background to ^.
Last I heard about RQ was just that it was cancelled.
Not sure whats up with that tweet.
From what I recall reading on /co/ the current artist was let go or something becauseo of reasons.
I guess it was disappointing in general because it was this comic that was going to be good.
But then constantly ran into issues actually being made.
No idea about actual cancellation though so.
Sejic had to drop it because he got massively burned out around that time to the point it affected his health and had to prioritize.
I have no idea about the actual reasons behind the current artist drop and I'm not honestly going to look into it.
Less than 3 hours since breakfast and I'm hungry again.
Ftrbzzs but then I'll never get svelte.
Anathema you don't need to be svelte to look healthy.
I know but less bodyfat will make pull-ups easier.
But muscle weighs too..
I need the muscle though I don't need all this fat.
Little bit of fat is ok 8-.
20% is not a little bit p.
Less than many others have -.
Hmm if I get another piercing this weekend that is *just* at the 6 weeks before I can take it out before my next Dirty Dozen race...
Start getting tats tbh.
Can't decide what to get.
Get can't decide what to get as a tramp stamp.
In a nice bold font.
Possibly in some asian language.
Closest I've come to picking something is the oroborous the homunculi in FMA have or the words Survival Is Fury but I was told that would be tacky p.
Not by a tatooist.
'fried noodles with chicken'.
I'm not getting a foreign language tattoo.
I can 100% believe you'd get a tattoo in Old Realm.
I did not consider that.
Guess I better dig out Lands of Creation tonight.
Protip Old Realm looks pretty shit honestly.
On account of it's just a super-busy alternative alphabet for English.
Is it not pictographic?
It's made of pictures.
But it's not symbolic.
So sure it visually resembles something between meso-American language middle kingdom heiroglyphs and proto-hanzi.
But it's as alien a language as the Tau alphabet GW published.
Ah I thought it was symbolic too.
Ie a glorified type font.
It might have been prior to the publication of Dreams?
Glories? I get them confused.
Is there nothing that book has not ruined!?
It never ruined lunars.
They were already bad you see.
Lunars are just an endless cycle of self-ruination.
I bought some rolls so I have carbs in my lunch are you fukken happy MoonWolf the Food Czar!?
I'm sure the 5 pounds of weight you'll gain from your rolls will be worth it.
One day I'll get a good lunar book.
Not this year though.
Probably not next yea reither.
I hope this actually accomplishes something.
Anathema you could just write a spider and shove it all into some github ?
I considered doing wget but I don't want to accidentally archive the entire BBC p.
People sitting in the next row from me seem to be on facebook / talking about pointless crap at least 50% of the day.
Not if Mercy has anything to do with it.
Wow that's quite the feat.
Should haev j ust waited for it to sink.
Also this is apparently cheesecake.
Pretty sure thats nto cheesecake.
Cooked_Auto are you in a terrible cooking thread or something ?
The fuck is tihs lady MAKING ?
Oh yeah put more cheese on it.
Clearly this needed more cheese.
Never made any pretty sure thats not how it works though.
I see the DS2 LP has some great fan art.
Ordered an android phone.
Rip windows phone ?
It's alive but my tablet is dead hairline crack on the screen completely screwing touch input and I'm fed up with how slow my phone is.
Plus I'm going to be older soon ¬_¬.
Minister your german is atrocious.
Its Helden Sterben Nicht.
I got most of it right.
Is German really non-rhotic?
Minister you had a difference of 9. On like an 20 letter thing.
You got HALF OF IT WRONG.
Spelling is an illusion.
I got the right sounds there.
Also 11/20 is a majority.
Minister you got the ending sounds on two of the words wrong.
11/20 is a significant reliance on party whips to get legislation through.
And 5 is infinitely more than 0 so 55% is infinitely better than 50.
Might as well be flawless.
You're talking israeli knesset levels of stability there.
Minister is practicing to enter American politics.
We're gonna build a wall and get reaper to pay for it.
Out of ice ?
Which would be kind of a-mei-zing.
I know Mercy is swiss but she can't find that much ice to build a wall.
I hooked the start of one word onto the end of the previous word which is a documented linguistic process that leads to words evolving.
Nah wall of chocolate and clocks.
Shame its still wrong though.
Get out of here with your portmanteaus.
A portmanteau is different.
They might change their minds about it if you shout at them forcefully.
Portmanteau is two words ferrying smushed together to make a new word - aka half the German language.
I forget the name for moving the spaces between words but.
I'd read it.
It's why an eykname is now a nickname or a nuncle is now an uncle in English.
Considering you know so many things.
Do you know when we will get more steven ?
No fuck you hexchat.
Iirc Fridays ie US Thursday evening for 4-5 weeks.
Why not for a year.
Why can't you just release regularly.
Like an actual show.
MoonWolf I'm not going to watch that because I avoid SU trailers.
Given they're 10% of an episode by time.
MoonWolf otoh Gravity Falls.
Minister its like 4 seconds.
Its not even a scene.
I stand by what I said =/.
It spoils more than your average movie trailer!
Let's not be ridiculous.
Anyway dinnertime back for gaem 2moz.
In fact caramel is so unlike sucrose C12H22O11 that its nature can't be expressed by a single chemical formula. Instead it's a mixture of caramelan C15H18O9 caramelane C12H9O9 caramelen C36H48O24 caramelene C36H25O25 caramelin C24H26O13 and over a thousand other compounds whose names one scholar lamented in 1894 science seems to have invented in a fit of despair.
Scientists have a better grasp of quantum mechanics than of caramel which is still poorly understood.
I love this playlist.
Don't worry that's gonna get nerfed.
Yup I remember Li-Ming at release.
Whenever I look at this one I just get hungry.
Headline from gizmodo rogue on images confirm new ships... yeah I'll bet they do.
Well yes the U-Wing is now a thing.
Whenever I look at this one I just get hungry. <- this looks delicous.
Quality group finder I see.
<- the exact reason I have not pirated doom.
Yeah I can get that.
GlennCuttlefish also its not piratable yet.
Give it a week on the upside.
I played bulletstorm instead.
That game wasn't as good as i remembered.
You are now on Smurf's shitlist.
Smurf doesn't have internet right now so unless he can connect to his ssh irc connection on a phone he'll never know.
So that's what it was v.
Right time to test out this blue cheese meatballs and mashed potatoes NO MUSTARD ALLOWED combo.
Mustard also great with cheese and basically mandatory on meatballs.
I just tend to go with ketchup.
I'll pretend I heard none of this heresy.
But then I just tend to eat meatballs and macaroni p.
Meatballs turned out pretty good. Got a bit more bite than I expected when I substituted milk with beer.
Mashed potatotes could use more butter whole milk or both I guess. Still turned out decent considering how rarely I make this.
I always forget just how filling mashed potatoes are.
Yeah been a while since I has mashed potatoes. Or pressed.
Catching up with SU.
This better not end with CONGRATULATIONS.
Nah it'll end with TO BE CONTINUED with some funky music on top.
Or even Komm Susser Tod.
Nah I meant like this.
I'd pay real internet bucks is SU really did end up with a komm susser todd sequence.
The tears would be great.
Hrmm wild mech mage concedes with massive tempo lead cos mirror entity spawned a sludge belcher played into an empty board.
Jfc why have google made maps so hard to use.
Ok it just changes the url as you move and zoom.
Ftrbzzs you said the lakes would be cold to swim in? I swam in this.
Anathema we'll have a sauna so you can swim all you like.
And that looks cold.
The waves were like 2-3 feet high though it was amazing.
I won my first war last night in Stellaris.
Against religious antelope men.
Had my first bug in stellaris last night.
Went to war with a tiny 1 planet place no reason other than I wanted their planet but they seemed to be the vassal of a much larger empire or something? I didn't get put into war with them though so I couldn't attack the other place because the big empire sent ships to it so it was under their control and I just had to wait for the people I went to war with to get bored of the stalemate and accept a white peace.
Also committed genocide of my slave race because anti-slavery people were getting annoying.
I lifted them up out of neolithic times! and this is the thanks I get!?
Or maybe feudal times.
And your solution to we don't live slavery was fine NO MORE SLAVES THEN.
Followed by mass murder.
Did you consider uhm.
Not having them be slaves ?
Briefly but they'd probably be mad I made them slaves in the first place.
And people being angry you commited genocide is better ?
I honestly don't know what the outcome will be.
The planet had 1 pop of my race the rest were the slave-race.
I should have exterminated them when I first settled it.
I'm on the Collectivist ethos.
They are not benefiting the collective so they must be purged.
We are also Fanatic Militarist so killing things is just how we roll p.
How cruel I got the charging cable for my phone before the phone.
Reading the stellaris subreddit it seems there is some weirdness around slaves and sectors ai controlled areas of your empire and my slaves were in a sector so it is totes the AIs fault I need to genocide them.
That's not even getting into the infinite tear down loops I mentioned earlier which can silently kill a planets development without you noticing. sector AI seems whack.
Did you read the thing where paradox just forgot to ship the game with its midgame events.
Its got early game events its got lategame events.
They did not include the set of events for where you spend most of the game.
Have they patched them in yet?
They are doing fixes first.
Then the event stuff.
I am midgame atm I thought it was a little quiet.
Guess I'll paint tonight.
Warhammer was cancelled.
Its not liek the game is broken.
You just won't get much in the way of events.
It'll still do you know.
Go kill some other spacenations or something.
Well the space-antelope people still exist.
The ally just wanted to get his planet back.
But I'm running out of areas to expand into without war.
My sim is too big.
Better drown them in a swimming pool after you delete the ladder.
Okay game I'm fine with nonsensical spell names.
But tell me kids what do you think a spell called anti-sept does.
Are spells / casters called septs ?
Not that I know of.
The things you build your casting items are called sepiths.
I guess.. that .. makes some sense.
But even then the spelling is just confusing.
Unrelated there should be a game about murdering German sausages.
Called Wurst Person Shooter.
Pun so bad irc kicked me.
Minister you deserved it.
MoonWolf must be mod again.
There's a food fair outside including a wurst van.
According to the guy who got a wurst though they had no currywurst.
Something tells me its not actually called a wurst van.
Which I mean why even.
MoonWolf Taste of Bavaria hot bratwursts or summat.
Their beer is good too.
Alas they weren't serving beer.
No wonder I'm fucken wired today moderate sleep restoration last night 95% of the time I get low.
Anathema you know that Scottish rendition of the word well being used emphatically not as an adverb.
Where the 'll' completely disappears?
Maybe if you used less languagey terms.
A sentence like Well what do you think?
Ok I thought you meant that but not sure what you mean by Where the 'll' completely disappears?
The end part of the phonic comes out as a glottal stop I think?
Oh like can't ?
It's either we' or maybe wey.
Sometimes wew I think?
Further adventures in random hearthstone card generation Common Neutral - Minion Pint-Sized Warlord - 11/8 for 9.
MairBear Minister GlennCuttlefish.
One thing is starting to really annoy me in this game.
The camera is practically never facing north when I exit a building.
MoonWolf that's a real beefy... probably gnome?
Game is still planned.
This week in Star Wars cliffhangers.
I still cant get over that one of the enemies in this a trio of flying melonpigs.
I know Reinhardt's old in the lore but he's not zimmerframe old...
I'll just quickly kill this boss and then go make dinner I thought.
Guess I'm on noodle diet today.
Its fine monster creation is taking a while anyway.
Yeah but if I start making what I planned I'll likely be back by around half past.
Well maybe not quite 20 past possibly.
I love That Brawl.
Is it friends completable this time or not ?
I thought That Brawl in the eyes of the community was the spiders?
The mechazod brawl is fun but not if you can only get your win with a random.
Oh is it the coop one?
MoonWolf re earlier *everyone* hates me because of the genocide.
And the person in my alliance left.
And I just lost most of my navy in a war so I'd be fucked if they turned on me right now.
Lessons have been learned.
OTOH I have like 4 vassal states.
They have some ships...
MoonWolf re earlier *everyone* hates me because of the genocide <- this sounds entirely reasonable tbh.
But how did they knooooow.
Genocide is not just a small thing.
People notice an entire race of people being corpses now.
MoonWolf just told me you made them slaves before the genocide.
You deserve this contempt.
MoonWolf re earlier *everyone* hates me <- There is a simple cure to this.
KIll them all bobby.
Not 木 but relevant.
This deck is pretty bs with the arcane golem nerf S.
Balls new sim wasn't working -> use online support -> 'ok it is activated now try again' -> still doesn't work.
Somehow ended up watching deadpool on stream.
It was decent enough.
Would have been better if it was a black and white silent movie.
By the Bravely Default devs.
Grmbl stupid body all I wanted was to sleep for a hour or two more.
GlennCuttlefish good morning glenn.
More like good afternnon.
So in last nights dream me and some friends were partaking in illegal drugs when some cops came upon us. We fooled the cops by cunningly dropping the contraband on the ground and escaping on a tiny amusement park train that moved at walking speed. Good thing someone had installed that thing around the block where I grew up.
Sup Com 2 disappointed me less than CivBE.
Gotta love xp scaling.
Normal enemies in this area give 1-2XP.
These enemies give 124XP.
Mind you these are a pain to kill. I have to pray I can get one 20% instakill move off before they all flee.
I think this one is taunting me. All of its comrades have fled 2 turns ago but this ballsy pom keeps charging up.
So far he has taken 10 of those instakill moves.
RIP you crazy ass pom if I could I would build you a memorial.
13*20% that was one lucky pom.
Like silver slimes or something ?
Rare and super valuable but run away and and are stupidly hard to kill ?
Yeah but less annoying to kill.
Also less annoying to find.
Somehow my party is surprised that a shadowy group of elite soldiers has an airship.
Your party appears to have protagonitis.
Break it to them gently.
MairBear i got the cardpack in a single game.
Hope you got/get similarly lucky.
2 games for me.
First was close but he did a double face-zap.
I don't think my paladin partnert quite got the trick.
Second game though at one point my opponent had 2 light and one medium warden.
Because we had a lightbane the whole match but he never buffed her.
Instead he kept buffing my trogg.
It go so big it got prioritized twice and didn't die.
Oh yeah I nearly lost the second one but I drew lorewalker. And he just has to kill it when it's the controllers turn so that might have saved us.
I made his medium warden strong enough to survive one of the blasts at least.
But yeah so glad new prioritise is how it is.
And that he's less spammy with the 3 random targets attack.
Another fine specimen in my party this child wasn't crying hard enough yet better slap her.
Lol there's a site where you put in your macronutrient targets and it generates meals for you.
Also the meals it generates are pretty mismatched. No one is going to want to eat 1 serving of cottage cheese and salsa with 2 servings of sweet creamy coleslaw as a meal.
Try some cottage cheese and salsa with a coleslaw side anathema.
Now Darkest Dungeon's hamlet will try and murder you after you finish a mission.
Anathema have a twenty-minute history of the Scots language read in Scots.
Well i'm not going to listen to it for obvious reasons.
Noelor sounds like one of my grandmothers.
MoonWolf brawl won first try.
Pretty sure both opponent and I weren't doing things right but w/e.
Noelor i think this one might be a lot easier than the previous 2 versions.
For 35 dust and my second Force of Nature!
How do you type yen?
That looks like a yen sign to you ?
Thats supposed to be a backslash.
Hexchat what are you even.
Those are backslashes to me.
Yeah that's the key I hit.
Yeah hexchat does that for some reason.
\ backlash is what I thought I typed.
Go to your server settings and check if this server is set to utf-8.
It isn't by default.
Charset changed to utf-8.
Go to your server settings and check if this server is set to utf-8.
Just manually switched to utf-8 before you said that.
So now you restart hexchat.
And then check again.
I have lost my server settings button.
Rightclick anywhere hexchat->network list.
Did you fix it ?
\\\ <- still yen.
Odd. When I paste that out of hexchat it turns into backlash.
GlennCuttlefish well it would.
¥ <- actual yen?
Thats not a yet.
Thats an up arrow.
Outside of hexchat its a yen.
Seems to be the default font hexchat uses.
The default font turns stuff into yen ?
Change the font then i suppose.
Now thats just chinese.
Noelor thats an é followed by a whole bunch of chinese.
I also changed font.
Okay so thats a fucking DUMB AS SHIT FONT.
And am wondering if that weird font thing is also why I couldn't read some 汉子 in here.
What font does it default too ?
Which is apparently garbage.
I don't have that font.
MoonWolf I decided to arena.
Not sure what good arena classes are these days.
Oh yeah arena's wild.
Got rogue went 2-3.
Game at 1-1 was against a Legend Priest.
Infested Tauren seems not quite worth 4?
9 stats for 4 mana is good vanilla value you get a taunt on top.
But the split isn't great.
Is that boring overstatted thing ?
Oh its the boring fair statted thing.
<- demon is clearly a superior coffee drinking specimen.
Bestial magma rager drops to mage ping.
The word to sum up the relationship between the two MC's in this game is Technically.
As in Technically it wouldn't be incest if we were involved romantically.
But why are you so upset moonwolf.
Because i'm sort of sick of this whole its incest but its not really incest and we don't really love eachother anyway.
But it wouldn't b eincest if we did.
But we don't but we're totally siblings-ish.
But he's adopted moonwolf.
Didnt sao go that way.
To busy LIVING IN THE DATABASE.
Pretty sure these two do love each other.
The main girl just has a bad case of protagonitis.
ASSORTED 4CHAN CANCER WEBMS oh boy let me just click on that link straight away.
Have you considered not doing it.
Just pointing out options.
Hm. devent vid quality rip of zootopia seems to be available...Decisions decisions watch it now or wait until I can get one with proper surround sound.
Or you could not watch shit movies.
What makes it such a shit movie then?
BwaS just hates animals and fun.
MoonWolf btw because me.
木u's near-death experience triggered the character-generating part of my brain.
Like ooh what about...
Just been contemplating what would multiclass with chaos mage.
I don't think anything really offers it much synergy.
What do its multiclass feats do ?
It basically adds a third flavour to your What magic do I have this turn bag of random results.
That 4th option being I'm my other class this turn.
Yeaah thats what i was afraid of.
I mean you could just pair it with commander.
Everyting pairs with commander.
Alternatively what pairs with paladin to make an actually interesting character.
Maybe these problems solve each other?
Well did you know.
Going to have a peruse at lunchtime.
Commander pairs well with paladin ?
Alternatively what pairs with paladin to make an actually interesting character <- if you dont find justice interesting by itself get the fuck out.
Everything I hear about Doom makes me want to buy it just because it sounds like an AAA game that doesn't suck for once.
Sadly I am in the same position.
Pity my toaster probably can't run doom.
Ah well only a few more days and I can drown my sorrows in other distractions.
Now our squad is being accompanied by our very own angry sarcastic ghost of a tech-priest who wants us to demonstrate to the Tau and Gue'vesa why they've so thoroughly underestimated the Omnissiah's servants. hehehe.
Cooked_Auto look what I got no backpack though which is a little annoying due to the scale differences vs modern models.
And all I can think of is Kill all the heretics Johnny kill em all thanks to WIP threads on tg p.
That is why I bought it p.
He can keep the anniversary Imperial Marine company though.
Wait what? O.
An all winston enemy team my favorite.
It all goes bananas.
Was hoping to ask Mair something.
MoonWolf don't suppose you remember if that belligerent artist you found in the mountains last week was human?
I don't remember race being mentioned at all.
I remember they were of Mair's culture.
But it's not too important rn.
I'm going to rudely assume they were a mair.
Arnold give me strength free raisin yorkies at work just now.
Is that some kind of dog?
A tiny wrinkly dog.
Tiny dogs are the worst.
Hence Ana's frustration I guess.
Guitar hero style games are a little more hardcore in japan.
Aaa Arrow still isn't on UK netflix and now my server has died I can't watch it via PMS either.
You'll have to watch it on your pc then.
They were stored on the server too p.
And you can only torrent a thing onc ein your life.
My mac has a tiny HD and I was going to watch while painting.
Maybe it is on my friend's plex.
Really confusing when opponents concede by hellfire-ing their own face off.
Bet it's not on amazon video either.
BwaS i love a good old murder myself instead of concede.
The higher damage the better.
Never concede always fight to the bitter end.
Ooh maybe I can stream it via popcorn time.
Y'see i was wanting to murder him but the life tap hellfire combo pushed his lethal and denied some elegant flamewaker/fireball double abusive sgt combo.
Well was like they were sitting in my hand minions played I didn't need to trade up into them or had spell deletion avail.
I am out of drink and snacks but I can't go outside.
Why can't you go outside ?
Coin out a ram wrangler he brings an angry chicken.
The beasts sure obey you.
Leg is killing me again.
Here is an infographic.
326 million bastions killed.
Oh look widow top pick.
High noon rolled around 5.7 million times a day.
That's a fast day/night cycle.
<- its me i'm the guy who likes going fast and id mediocre.
>like all healer picks in all games is apathetic and hates everyone around them.
I dont always pick winston.
But when I do that is extremely accurate.
Also that reaper is accurate.
I would agree on rein but I like to think I am good at shooting.
Eeyup Mercy description fits me.
MoonWolf I have a 4/1 mana wyrm on board and an unharmed flamewaker my opponent has 20 hp I have 27 he plays doomguard.... and goes face.
I coin sylvanas and go face now he has no cards left. He's down to 10. He ... goes face with his doomguard.
Why is that kind of person even at rank 14 D.
C'thun is op at >10?
I can only assume the guy hoped I didn't know that fireball + 12 on board was a bigger number than the 8 he tapped down to...
9 or below is only a play if you're desperate or you have the bring cthun back from the grave card.
Not a serious guess at the number.
Why is that kind of person even at rank 14 D <- going face works.
I just expect opponents to at least show a basic grasp of numeracy D.
You think you've got problems.
Stuck getting win-farmed at 20-19 by all the p2w tryhards with their golden fandrals.
Logged off and immediately realised I'd been speaking to MairBear.
MairBear iirc the artist y'all ran into in the mountains was from 美's secondary People.
Can you remember which of the three species.
Also in case Glenn asks while I'm on my way home again game is on tonight though Zac may be a little late due to a school thing.
Noelor the artist was from the neighbouring land the one that does not really like Trallandish.
MoonWolf so uh... that wrait I was reading.
Was a non-mook from a different spell >.>.
Should I expend that spell as well as bones beneeath?
Just keep it as it was.
I found this out cos I was doing macros and realised that... all the bones beneath things a skelly mooks.
Just with bigger statlines >.>'.
GDI talk to myself.
Why are 3 of my 5 tests crits here c.
Based on first 2 episodes of Crazy Gunnuts anime Finnish waifu edition this might turn out even good.
Noelor better green? p.
Anathema certainly matches the yellow better.
Dunno what the rest of your army is like of course.
Knights are unique get their own colour scheme.
Meanwhile in luluko Unified trigger theory intensifies.
Anathema a we are playing Fellowship tonight.
B rn we're discussing this week's Steven Universe.
In case you were considering swapping channel.
Not even at my desktop p.
Not watched SU yet anyway though.
Why so mumble then?
Mumble was on when I hibernated it earlier.
I don't *think* you were there when I logged in.
Sometimes it turns itself on.
Arrow S3 isn't free on amazon.
But it does have Young Justice.
Well shite my old ally now enemy allied with someone else who hates me.
Someone is about to have a bad day.
Could do with one of the Reins being second Mercy maybe?
Noelor nah its perfect.
That poor levle 1.
MoonWolf right after I said that their ally left them and joined another alliance.
I went to war with some people to vasselize them because they were sandwhiched between two other vassels.
My rivals took that moment to strike while my fleets were distracted!
I have been able to turn the tide by having a brave fleet with hyperdrives instead of warps zip around their systems until my main fleet could get back.
Did they do anything besides run interference ?
Then joined my main with my secondary so it became a 12k fleet and a 2k fleet vs a 6k fleet they fled 2k fleet follwed and held them until the 12k turned up.
Those brave 2k fleet horse-people gave their lives though.
Am now bombing their main planet.
WHILE my vassels in the other war for me.
One of my battleship designs has mega-long range space lightning cannons.
Thats not how space works.
So that was zootopia.
Gotta love a ranked system where the ladder is not zero-sum and a defeat costs you 1.5x the amount a victory can earn.
My dad's in bed. So it must be the cat cutting those onions somewhere.. w.
So here I am doing a mission in this JRPG run into 2 guards at a door.
Music doesn't change or anything.
1.5 turns later my group is dead.
Well I hope you learned an important lesson then.
Bollocks. forgot about the overwatch cinema event and it appears to have sold out.
I honestly don't think you'll miss much.
Besides lots of nerds who like overwatch.
Suppose but there's apparently swag.
IMO Life is Strange could have and should have been gayer fair.
Panzer's LP of which has finished btw.
And then lament it wasn't gay enough apparantly.
Mastermind is a real mean Overlord Custom incidentally.
Its mean becaues action economy.
It's super mean as a second level-up.
Because when taken it advances every Plan by one stage.
Well pick something else then >.>.
Get free advances on top.
Well afaik it's the only move that says advance every Plan.
Every other time I'd advance I advance just the one.
But it means that if you are a dick about it.
So from here on out every advance I'm choosing between 3.
You can advance a plan to the penultimate step as the end of session thing.
Then take that move.
Then gain 2 new plans.
And advanec your second plan as well.
You gain a custom before you advance a plan on level-up.
But it's pretty moot.
Taken as the second level-up either I have now completed a plan or have three on the brink of being completed.
Anyway you should actually meet the Overlord... next week? maybe week after? depending on how the next leg of Journey goes.
After which he'll know about the Fellowship and start recruiting generals instead of going all-in on plan advancement.
Oh I totally fucked how community fellowship works.
We we're not supposed to get 2 dwarve s?
Ok so I gave you three things.
What is supposed to happen is I give you *the option of* three things.
And you choose one.
It was the first time you saved a community so I guess you got an extra-good reward.
For producing so much extra hope.
What happened was that Grant Fellowship is an Overlord move that tells me what to do when you solve a community's problems and get the Fellowship whereas Earning Fellowship is a fellowship special move that says what you do after that.
MoonWolf is wobbling code for over budget?
Noelor its not over budget.
Its on budget for a class card.
But you never see class cards without text.
This is so bad.
Hold on my firefox is hanging terribly.
Noelor this is basically peak terrible western original vn.
All it needs is a seperate download not on steam to enable the porn.
The terrible terrible porn.
Just gimme an indie filter and it will all be fine.
Well either an Indie or Greenlight filter.
Also seen in my queue a game with both the VR and Early Access tags.
Even if I were in on the whole VR thing I do not want a game that is not fully tested and finished.
I like the contents of my stomach to remain there.
Really they should just simulate a nose and you should be mostly fine.
Cooked_Auto i'm not sure it works that way.
Fun fact virtual reality developers figured out that adding a simulated nose in VR reduces nausea because your brain expects it to be there even if you don’t consciously notice it.
So its basically too fast to see it in game.
But it turns out lucios reload animation is actually amazing.
I was more thinking of a bug I heard about on a podcast wherein one but only one of the eyes stopped being able to move down while still being able to move up.
The human brain does not deal well with that.
No not it would not.
You know you're in the last dungeon when enemies self destruct have a a radius of 1/4 of the screen.
This might have been a mistake.
So I just mentioned those self destructing caster mobs that have a really big self destruct that also does a whole lot of damage.
I had the brilliant idea of casting mute on them.
And now they refuse to die?
Now they walk up to me and punch things.
Instead of being over there where its safe to kill them.
Fortunately managed to get shields up before my AOE killed them.
Midway through draft opposition picks Nova. I hardpick Tassadar next phase. Victory. FEELS SO GOOD.
I made a pirate warrior let's find out how bad it is.
Well this is promising.
You're fighting some kind of robot boss.
And then it announces MODE ANNIHILATION.
Always a sign you're in for a good time.
Well then. the boss has a move that does 2700 damage.
At least you're only getting anhiliated could be worse. I mean you could gastronomically annihilated or overwhelmingly annihilated.
My highest HP pool is 2200.
Time to cast shield and never let it drop.
Thats a lot of damage.
Whats that? Trying to cast counter magic on me? HA HA HA I'm behind 4 thousand shields.
What game is this anyway?
Or in other words Legend of heroes Trails in the sky First chapter.
Noelor i don't know about y our pirate warrior.
But pirate warrior is currently being used on a major tournament.
I think I have too many weapons in mine rn.
But unsure which to drop or where the actual balance is.
I'll keep working on it thouhg.
Also using Blizzard's dragon mage to mixed results.
Yeaah i don't think that deck is actually any good.
The curve is pretty fucked.
<- nowhere is safe from the riptire.
I only recently learned it could climb.
But it's p good.
I only recently learned reinhardt has a range attack other than rocket charge.
Did you never try him ?
You may have been doing it wrong.
That fire hammer thing is something you should use as much as safely possible.
Since its your main way of building ulti most of the time.
That and people shooting your shielf.
Does it? I didn't notice any dramatic increase when blocking.
Guess I heard wrong then.
Well that was certainly an ending.
If I didn't have the second part on my HD I might even be kinda upset.
Still don't have a working phone after spending an hour in the vodafone store was once again given a new sim and garaunteed it would work within 24 hours.
OTOH someone I haven't seen in a year said they barely recognised me and then asked if I'd started lifting because I was looking pretty big. So that was rather nice.
Anathema going to echo what Smurf said about 3 being a good provider.
I used to also be on Vodafone.
Yeah a couple of mates in Cambridge have said the same luckily they also have a shop in the same shopping centre as vodafone D.
Also got another piercing so I am symmetrical again.
Oh that reminds me.
How did you find a place to get piercings?
Been thinking about doing my ears a while now.
Uh it's visible from the shop where I bought my guitar and I remembered it was there >_>.
Seems like the sort of thing to shop around for but.
I dunno a simple lobe piercing is pretty hard to fuck up.
For a tattoo definitely shop around but simple stuff should be OK.
I let the apprentice do my ear today 50% cheaper! and it was basically the same experience but mega-simple piercing hardest bit was lining it up with the first one.
GlennCuttlefish you win this battle.
I bought it >.>.
I just bought the basic version though >.>.
I mean its just cosmetics.
NO mercy wings in diablah.
Well you have kerrigan wings.
Only tryhards get the origins or whatever.
Saves you 10k on tracer in heroes like.
GlennCuttlefish and also the wealthy.
MoonWolf is the 1%.
Wealthy are the biggest tryhards of all.
Oh look at me I have money that I can use to be special ooo.
I pay to win! - D.Va 2016.
GlennCuttlefish with their graphics.
And their loading times.
And their fancy audio.
You're the audiophile of us.
I'm too poor to be an audiophile.
Also I downloaded the movie. It's bork C.
If I hit play nothing happens if I fast forward it plays at double speed. I think it might just be my media player.
Huh. Odd my copy worked perfectly'.
What is the media player of you cool doods these days?
GlennCuttlefish that works fine.
Vlc... guess I'm not cool... guess I knew that already.
Just use CCCP with MPC.
Well you know how the interwebs goes.
It's either the greatest player everywhere.
Or it's actually giving your pc cancer.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish Noelor.
But... they're australian not kenyan!
Meanwhile in Jojo Bast is the ancient Egyptian goddess of cats and magnets.
I could never get into jojo.
I would say try skipping the first season.
Battle Tendency ramps up way quicker.
Also Joseph is the best Joestar.
Get on my level.
Noelor re last night one thing I can recommend is to get the initial piercing as a stud no matter what you want to eventually wear so much easier.
Less than 3GB space on the mac guess I should delete some crap.
AI uprising in a neighboring empire the machines threatened me D.
Anathema the only solution is to purge them.
MoonWolf well yes because they want to kill all organics.
Reaper is the quintessential wannabe.
The essence of tryhard.
Noelor mercy actually turned reaper into an undying ghost thing.
Holy shit giant fleet of robots invading one of my vassals.
My main fleet was at the otherside of the empire in case my rivals there declared war D.
>two minutes later having cleared their own board and taken about 5 damage they concede.
!note MairBear Priest Mirror.wmv.
Oh gods the alt text for today's Oglaf.
Original character do not steal.
New short soldier 70 too old for shit.
I've got chew in mice heights.
Its hard to talk with a mask on ?
This caster keeps calling gadgetzan auctioneer gadgetsan auctioneer.
And it bothers me.
I wonder if it's the same one I heard saying Emperor Thor-iss-ee-un.
Oh-ho man dat midrange shaman doomhammer into next turn control warrior harrison drop for 6-draw XD.
BwaS i didn't even look what would happen.
I went to get a drink.
The conclusion was inevitable.
One thing that annoys me about trails in the sky is that the animations are so slow at times.
Yep yep they are.
Aaa my head cant take more jrpg's with slow animations and overwatch isn't out for DAYS.
What to do what to do.
I'm fine with this headcanon.
Well its not wrong.
How difficult is it to make a generator on that bonsai thing moonwolf?
Depends on how complicated you want to get.
Say I want to make something comparable to your foxhound unit names generator.
Thats not that hard.
Or you can just give me two lists of words and i can have it up for you real quick.
Because I am really really bored.
I'll do it myself if I get around to it.
I was planning on making a finnish swear generator.
Ie a Finnish dictionary?
Now now we dont have that much swearing in our language.
You don't pay attention for like 3 days.
And there is 3 steven episodes.
If there's one thing SATW has taught me it's perkele.
Jesus christ lapis how did you go from best gem to worst gem in half an episode.
I'm having winnie the pooh flashbacks here.
Well since I still have 2 failed sauces from saturday time to go fry some chicken and halloumi for wraps.
The latest two episodes were broadcast early in France or something?
So the next SU is now ages away.
No <3 for rubies ?
And I dunno who's seen it.
Like I know ana won't have f'rinstance.
Though also he's flagged as away.
Oh hey hearthstone daily will be up.
>Everybody! Get in here!
I just watched the 5th of the season.
The quest is everybody.
Oh right that's what you meant.
Yeah I rerolled one of my 40's into that one too the other day.
Not really the brawl to do it with this wk S.
Apostrophes are indicative of a certain kind of fantasy I wanna stick away from fair.
MoonWolf noelor's opponent is playing....
An agro... deathrattle... mill.... c'thun deck?
Turns out both failed dip sauces work decently in chicken wraps.
This one will never stop being funny.
However I am still at loss as to what actually was in the sauce that was served at my usual kebab place.
Because that sauce was godly with fries and nuggets.
One of the ingredients was Glenn was 14 years younger.
Possibly but it was still great.
I am pretty sure curry was involved. maybe cucumber.
Mair oh shit I have to go to the bank today and deposit some money.
Oh wait no I cant.
Because my nearest bank offices dont take cash these days.
Zog me 14 yrs ago I do not want to think back that long ago on my timeline.
But its only less than half a lifetime ago.
Oh gods I'm feeling old again.
No but seriously what kind of sad world is this where banks dont take money?
That indeed seems kind of against the point of banks.
Not in that office.
I hear there is some kind of ATM nearby that allows for deposits but I haven't seen one.
Do they let you withdraw cash there?
... what do they even do then!
Which kind of baffles since I did so until last year at that office.
Make you wait for 40 minutes while they serve one customer.
Weird. I know I can do cash insertions at the bank office in my town.
So I just checked if there is a fee on the deposit atm.
For private customers there is no fee...For now.
Not sure how it is in Finland but Australian ATM's charge for withdrawals if you don't bank with the ATM owner.
Same here I thin.
And they post passive aggressive messages on them to advertise you switching to them.
Pretty sure I get charged when withdrawing even if I am a customer.
ATM charges vary a lot by country.
Alright guess we just have it good here.
In fact its ridiculous it costs me less money to withdraw from an ATM in sweden than it does in FInland.
Dob ATM charges in the UK are included in the account fee that all current accounts have.
Wait no I might be mistaken. I checked withdrawing costs money I think my fee's are from usually checking my...thingymajig. how much money I actually have.
Noelor> mine doesn't have one...
*withdrawing costs no money.
Charged balance enquiries you have my sympathies.
Dob that seems wrong but ok.
I know there's 'premium' ones that do was briefly on it as the interest rate gain outweighed the fee but not on the one it runs atm.
A tumblr user can't decide between listing the Peridot and Garnet ship as Perinet or Garnidot whyyyyy.
I just don't like it.
Not sure if the bag is big or she's small v.
16 HOURS TO GO.
Cavalry's not quite 'ere.
Love Cavalry Here's cheers.
This ZOE2 dialogue is something alright.
While I am not a fan of notch thats the clickbaitiest strawman story I've seen in years.
<- Why are they playing mahjong instead of poker and why is it making me this angry?
Clearly disparaging against other people who enjoy mahjong I.
Look nothing wrong with mahjong I myself enjoy a quick riichi now and then but its goddamn cowboys gambling.
Actually waking up before noon.
Woke up in time to see high noon.
Aaa that reminds me I should go to that stupid ATM now.
For those who aren’t in the know in OoT Ganondorf was raised by two tiny witch sisters with the power to fuse together into some kinda titty catsuit cougar grandma called Twinrova. yeah that's a decent summary.
This is why i don't play zelda games.
Do you have a problem with Ganondorf's mums MoonWolf ?
Looks like i do.
He is otoh the bestest of dads.
I'm not sure thats great dadding.
Wait he's her dad?
I dont think he is.
I thought she was... some sort of parallel dimension doodad.
I should play more HW.
This is almost completely without exaggeration the plot of Hyrule Warriors.
I like the game I just play it so rarely I'm always bad at it.
Cooked_Auto not debating that.
But nowhere in that comic is he her dad.
And I don't believe he is in the game either.
Hyrule warriors is good fun even if some of the bosses are not.
Once I finish Super Metroid I'll have another go at gitting gud.
Can finish super metroid but having difficulty with hyrule warriors.
Beat this total fucker last night.
GlennCuttlefish well I haven't finished Super Metroid *yet*.
And I'm beating a lot of it by belligerence rather than skill =P.
Hey if it works it works.
That's how I get through Viewtiful Joe p.
One of these fights you wont fuck up and the boss will have only easy patterns!
I mean I don't think Kraid was too bad?
That picture makes no sense.
Something is defying gravity.
Love the colours but someone used way too much starch on that hood.
To be fair neither did the original scene in the first spider-man movie.
<- I was expecting spiders. Turned out slightly better.
Retro Tower Defense oh that sounds cool.
>Defend your ship in action sequences.
That is not how you retro TD =/.
But is it in shitty pixel graphics.
Due to your recent playtime in other Difficult games don't lie to me Steam I don't play difficult games.
Egads I didn't have to download the entirety of overwatch again from beta.
There was a patch a few days ago.
Sweet my OPM shirt finally arrived.
Overwatch's timeline is so fucked.
It's not even out yet!
I'm just looking at hero ages.
Being partically comic-ish its mandatory to have a f ucked up nonsensical timeline.
And they don't even have time travel yet.
Aside from tracers personal short term.
She did some medium-term by accident before Winston made her widget.
Like I'm just looking at character ages.
Whats wrong with them then?
Ok so Pharah wanted to join Overwatch but it was disbanded before she could and she's 32.
Tracer was in Overwatch before it disbanded and is 26.
Was she in overwatch or was she in overwatch though.
Overwatch has a story? p.
Overwatch the universe has a story.
The game doesn't try to do story stuff.
Because the actual gameplay wouldn't make any sense for story.
Tracer was in overwatch at least enough for her to reply to winstons recall.
Also pictures with winston.
Why are a whole bunch of shuffled up characters trying to escort a bomb into london ?
Hence why I'd rather play an OW RPG. Heck the latest short made me want to run or play some sort of Overwatch Shadowrun-ish campaign even.
Reinhardt 61 was in Overwatch when it was formed Over 30 years ago was retired from service in his late 50s and got to watch it fall apart from the sidelines.
So like how long was it actually disbanded before Winston decided to bring the band back together? was it even that long?
Meanwhile we know Reaper and 76 were leading Overwatch when it fell but both their ages are Unknown because in-universe nobody knows they're Reyes and Morrison.
Oh and of course the animated shorts could happen in any order at all with the exception that the reveal cinematic happens after Recall probably.
Why are a whole bunch of shuffled up characters trying to escort a bomb into london ? <- terror attack on the Omnic community there I think.
Last night in Stellaris the Fallen Empire near me finally took notice of me and threatened to go to war unless I removed a bunch of planets near their territory.
As in evacuate or destroy?
As in no longer a part of my empire no longer populated.
I dunno what happened to the pops that were on them.
Also now my empire has a Humiliated modifier.
You just Exterminatus'd your own planets because some old people said so.
OTOH a neighbouring empire about as large as mine went to war so I went to war with them and now own them.
The guys they went to war with helped me out.
Well while digging into noelors question I now have an answer to the question Why are there giant robots out there.
Soon I will build a fleet big enough to attack the fallen empire.
Also one my vassals keeps insulting me.
Why are a whole bunch of shuffled up characters trying to escort a bomb into london ? <- terror attack on the Omnic community there I think <- yeah but why are tracer and zenyata trying to blow up an omnic community.
You can't make it make much sense.
So they do not try.
After the AI uprising I banned intelligent machines in my empire meaning all robots were dissassembled but some planets I just took hve robots on them but I can't dissassemble them because I changed my policy on genocide |.
Its not genocide if its a robot.
Well while digging into noelors question I now have an answer to the question Why are there giant robots out there <- to fight omnics and kaiju.
Are the giant robots to fight kaiju too?
I know that's why D.Va's mech exists.
I thought Russia's giant mecha was explicitly for fighting giant omnics.
Though I suppose it's not like it *can't* fight kaiju.
I know i'd want to punch giant monsters with it.
Man the whole kaiju thing has no elaboration huh.
Now I want a game mode in which 6 or 12 players team up against a kaiju somehow.
Thats already a game its called evolve.
Though in that someone plays as the kaiju right?
Ok I'm pretty sure alive takes place shortly after recall.
Anyway meanwhile I have to pick a second partial for Herithia.
Since Mondatta is going to be speaking in london later that day according to the news report.
Really glad I decided to go with a brighter green D.
Anathema that's a nice green!
I can't wait to get all main plates done I've already done the first pass on most of the metal bits so once I finish the plates around the head she should be tabletop ready and I can work on the details D.
Finally smart watches pay off.
Hm. Wonder how should I decorate Peluna luna's pog.
I was thinking of symmetric shapes but that might be beyond me.
Turns out i need to get a lot better at lucio.
Lucio does have my favorite movement mechanic in the game at least.
Thats an angry lucio.
Watching that I just have the angry bidoof monologue playing in my head.
MoonWolf are you able to easily locate that video of Lució's reload animation?
Noelor no but Cooked_Auto can.
Lució is the coolest.
Also I opened 13TW to look at Occultist levelup options ended up reading Chaos Mage.
With any luck I'll even finish the pog before the campaign ends.
...why is Amulet of Kings written in the middle of Herithia's character sheet?
From beneath you the dragon devours.
Did she pick it up?
Noelor nobody can pick it up.
Magically cannot be worn by non dragonblooded.
Pretty sure you gave us something like that at one point.
I'm guessing you don't want it to replace the colour version though?
Well as the filename might indicate WIP. I'm going to colour that once I figure out the decorations.
Noelor nobody can pick it up <- sorry people can pick it up.
You just can't wear it.
Ok I'll assume it's on her sheet because she's carrying it then.
Things having been a bit busy at the end there.
Not sure if Elena's expression says anticipation or defeat.
But there is something off to her hips/shoulder ratio in my eyes.
I hadn't notice that before.
So its not just me.
It's probably supposed to be perspective.
Yeah i don't know.
Rollable tables the class.
Its really tempting to go into my bonsai rollable table and add MORE STUFF.
At least a roll twice/three/four more get all effects.
But you have to realize how tempting it is.
Also basically to duplicate the whole baldurs gate wild mage table.
Who doesn't like trying to cast magic missile but instead opening up a Gate under every creature in line of sight.
The same people who don't like Fun.
Its only funny because its a game with a save system who the fuck wants that in real life nobody thats who.
Meanwhile at some point somebody ie broelor put some Yes onto my HD.
Which just came up on shuffle in Foobar.
I have prepared JSRF playlist to be used in about 9 hours.
And I was like Hey this best-of CD doesn't have Roundabout.
So now Amazon has 99 more of my pence and the problem has been remedied.
I guess thats not one of their best Noelor.
For whatever reason it's only disc 2 of their best-of album.
I don't know how that intro is hella recognizable.
So it could be on disc 1.
It might not be known to anyone who doesn't anime is the thing.
I dunno I was only aware of the band by name before watching Jojo.
This is great.
I too created a playlist.
GlennCuttlefish i think you have too many songs there.
I think the amount is fine I just switched some tracks around.
GlennCuttlefish unelightened masses and it has to be this way were fine though.
Not sure if I should make a proper playlist for overwatch.
Maybe i'll just make a playlist thats just concept of love and rules of nature.
I mean if I am making a playlist I will have to make 3 different ones I think.
One for support one for attacking and one for standing on objective as tank.
MoonWolf I've stated my conflicted opinion on Zarya's sexuality right?
I don't think you have explicitly ?
Not that i can remember.
May not have been there.
Ok so ideal world everyone in the cast is queer including Zarya.
That wouldn't be an ideal world that'd just be weird.
Real world not everyone is queer and *in that world* I do not want Zarya to be gay because this lady is beefy therefore gay is uuuuuugh.
Like if you have one lesbian in the cast please don't let it be the strong lady.
Okay i'm going to say something weird.
They're all a lesbian stereotype.
And I thought I watched too much yuri stuff.
I'm going to ask you to elaborate on Mei and Mercy.
Mercy and symmetra maybe no.
Mei is the giant nerd.
Nerd ladies are all gay now?
No but there sure is a lot of gay nerd ladies.
I also disagree on Widow btw but only in that she'd stereotypically be bi.
The real issues ofcourse is that at this point we've stereotyped 600 ways in which you can be gay.
Which is WEIRD AS HELL.
Also if Symmetra's on the autism spectrum there's probably a stereotype somewhere that says she's ace.
MoonWolf especially once you start looking outside western culture.
OW soundtrack tomorrow and then Warcraft movie on Friday. Aw yiss.
Okay I dont know what the hell yakety sax was doing in my nagamuna folder but its staying on the support playlist.
...Why have I at some point downloaded the spanish opening for david the gnome?
Oh found the donnie darko soundtrack...And now I want to play city of heroes.
Well you cant sadly.
And its just owl noices.
I dont know what I expected.
Well thats certainly one feature this program could do without.
Was going through library accidentally pushed enter that album starts playing.
In the same playlist I was just making. and I cant undo it.
Fortunately I had saved when I moved on to my main music folder.
GlennCuttlefish I dont know what I expected - sounds like a real hoot to me.
Isn't there a coh private server ?
No idea tbh but I don't think so.
I think thats enough tracks for support playlist.
Whats the general style of it ?
I dont think there is any general style.
Some soundtracks some punk rock some house some classical.
Oh and hit songs from 80's and 90's I can hum along if there is a boring moment.
Time to start working on the tank one which definitely will have a general style.
I bet its going to be The Hoff.
Well metal + OST of max anarchy.
Odd. cant find my GG XRD OST anywhere. Guess I'll have to download it again.
Sorry dont have it.
Np already had a link in mind.
One of these days I'll have to give up and just download manowar discography for my tank playlists.
Total Warhammer releasing against Overwatch. Wonder who'll win p.
I mean overwatch will draw more players.
But they don't really compete against eachother that way ?
Unlike overwatch and that another game that is now dead and nobody remembers.
Borderborn sounds like a good game.
Not a shooter t hough.
WarhammerTW has been getting favourable reviews so.
Related I feel.
I didn't realise it had done *that* poorly.
It got outsold by the FFX port on Steam.
To quote the thread.
However taking on Blizzard when they have an actually new game set around a new IP is the videogame industry equivalent to invading Russia.
Competition is good. It's what drives makes and ends businesses.
And not land war in Asia?
Last I checked russia comes packaged with that.
If you first manage to get to moscow somehow.
Only the back half.
Sure but the reason russia originally expanded to east was so they could have some of that sweet landwar in asia if they are invaded.
Did they expand to the east?
Or did the east expand into them?
They took the bits no one really gave a damn about.
Siberia? You can have it. The taiga? Fuck it it's yours.
Only times the east expanded into russia russia got fucked Or the areas that we now think of as russia.
Well maybe not only but the only notable time I can think of.
There we go.
Turns out mcree is a jojo.
I still like the fact that Widowmakers japanese VA voiced Valmet the psychotic finn with an eyepatch in Jormungand while Mercy did Koko.
ERIK KILLMONGER oh comics.
Look thats just his family name okay.
His great great great grandfather monged kills for a living.
They lived next to the KILLGRAVE's.
Purple man's real last name p.
Cooked_Auto yeah it's his only name in the Netflix series.
At least as far as I've watched it.
<- oh god battleborn.
Thats not a good sign.
Also why do people like that dumb youtube thing.
Lol how long until gets removed?
Quite a few here are some copyrighted musics mods.
Culture name list mod.
I see Mair did the smart thing and went to be so that he's actually awake when OW releases.
You say that like Blizzard's servers will also be awake when OW releases.
Noelor it'll be awake for about a minute.
And then it'll be dead.
Hey could someone else type reinhardt sprite into g-image for me?
Because I am seeing no sprites of Reinhardt in the first page of results but am seeing other OW characters.
I see no reinart.
I see a lucio a reaper.
Scroll down a little i see a reinhart but screenshot not a sprite.
No way this isn't porn.
Despite being 100% sfw.
And then there's this.
Those are not even good pony images.
And way to tiny.
And of course.
Seriously would it hurt to use more pixels.
Noelor i think that one was inevitable.
Wouldn't you want to do the wings befor eyou did the thing with the hand ?
Its on a different layer so it wont be much of an issue I imagine.
Yeah but just on principle.
GlennCuttlefish i see through your bullshit.
You don't even live in a real country.
Finland is nowhere near sweden.
There is an admiral duplication bug in Stellaris o_0.
3 of my fleets are allegedly led by the same guy.
3 hour until I can be disappointed with blizzards servers.
We could go to be early wake up early and play then!
Ha ha ha no.
Anathema it's just a common name in your culture ok?
Maybe its a positional name.
If you get to be admiral in an important enough fleet.
You just get that name.
Noelor no I split a fleet in two the admiral should get shunted into one but both fleets were led by the same guy.
Its a very traditional family.
I think I should have enough anime backlog to last until launch.
Well I definitely do if I include jormungargardgarrgdrgrgrrrarggd.
2 hours and 30 mins is not a lot of anime backlog.
Considering its from past 2 weeks.
And I've been watching stuff.
So you managed to procure funds? o.
GlennCuttlefish Noelor what would you say is the best starting point for JoJo?
What's the start Glenn? D.
If you start at the second anime there's a version of Phantom Blood that's like 2 episodes?
But battle tendency is the best season imo.
Haven't watched the later ones still however.
The stand stuff just didn't really work for me in the end maybe it gets better after stardust crusaders.
Phantom Blood is the original series with Jonathan and Dio.
But yeah Battle Tendency is the peak of Jojo.
It's a jolly holiday with Tracer~.
Well thats kiznaivers caught up with time to watch some assholes from the internet taking a class trip.
Ok so here's the situation You are stuck in the middle of nowhere with people you dont know and one of them is screaming you should execute everyone for the slightest thing.
Do you 1 Listen to them 2 Lock them up somewhere where they are of no harm to you or themselves?
If you chose 2 you are more intelligent than the characters in this.
1 seems logical if they are not going to execute me.
78 High Noons to go till Overwatch!
If the setting wasn't so interesting I would drop this show.
Everyone is dumber than baboons.
Oh my god they did totally go there with the latest luluco episode D.
C_A my current theory is that luluko is just a big trailer for PS season 2.
That wouldn't surprise me if they show up too.
By now I am expecting it.
Nova is otoh a huge ass.
Finally one night I thought ‘It should be satisfying to hit an enemy.’ Just think about what's satisfying beer. So I literally opened a beer bottle. Pssht. The sound is reversed and tweaked a little but that sound is our hit-pip.” Haha.
2 noons and counting.
What was the number on diablo? error 37 or something?
Half the internet right now.
Nobody *can* be playing Reaper right now.
Pretty sure they can by now.
Cooked_Auto Blizzard servers though.
They seem to be working haven't seen too many pings about that on my feeds.
Well they weren't when I said the thing to Glenn I.
GlennCuttlefish new Poppy imagename is page56GAAAAAAAY.png.
Work painball tomorrow tonight I need to watch all the paintball community episodes.
...Well I can't fault that.
Except the season 4 one.
...shit I need to get ear protection.
New If These Trees Could Talk album soon pretty fucken hype Red Forest was the first post-rock I bought.
Huh didn't know that last one.
New paints O.
Huh didnt know about the paints.
I walked past one of those wall mounted clocks/temperature displays that said it ws 28C outside. I found that kind of hard to believe.
Jojo and Leon S Kennedy he really is a certified badass.
0% surprised to see a drillhair dohoho on WM.
Kind of disappointing the only interesting things I could find while checking out the second hand stores in town was a copy of the Wheel of Time game and Emperor Battle for Dune.
“It’s an intergalactic buddy road movie with Banner and Thor.” D.
Bob Ross he ain't.
Gee thanks for the help.
It's translating Korean into Japanese.
But there we are.
Yeah but it doesnt translate it to English like the rest.
So its a bit of a dick move.
Maybe because it's a sound effect?
I mean it's still dumb.
*grumble* still no downloads for the OW soundtrack.
Anyone remember the name of that japanese TRPG about Phoenix Wright lawyers?
The name eludes me completely but I know which one.
Thought all the ladder p2w tryhards wouldve fucked off to overwatch tonight...
Too cheap to buy it.
MoonWolf that is gold.
Noelor the best part is that there is a really obvious solution.
That is simply not even being considered.
Is that the best part?
Does it involve the words Sorry? p.
Idiot too dumb to just block ex.
Well okay that too.
So contact with the ISP has yielded plans for a modem to up line down speed from 20 Mb/s to 50.
Until then and since that correspondence down/up and ping have gone to shit past days S.
Scum of the earth.
I mean it could be the other person in the house back this wk who probs has their laptop tablet and 2 mobiles on constant wifi use and synching.
Are you also on wifi ?
Because thats should barely dent the actual ine.
A roman walks into a bar. He holds up two fingers and says 'Five beers please'.
A greek walks into a bar and says 'Ill have a Martinus'. The bartender says 'dont you mean a martinit?' The Greek says 'if I wanted two I'd tell you'.
Surely that's latin not greek.
Otherwise good classical linguistics joke.
MoonWolf let me know if I can grab a HS win spectate off you today o.
MairBear going to start upHS now for my morning dailies.
MairBear you know what'd be nice.
If i ever had apropriate removal in my hand.
I've had hands full of deaths with no 5+ stuff.
And tons of deathable stuff on the field and nothing in hand.
Because I was either going to HS or OW with my coffee.
In my continueing mobile phone saga my number has not yet been transferred but I got a bunch of texts from vodafone on my new 3 one?
Noelor i won 3 times.
Time to win 2 more times.
Anathema did you get 3 to steal your old number from voda?
Noelor yeah I got the pac on sunday and the guy in 3 did it when I got my contract and said it should be done by tuesday yesterday I got a text from 3 saying it should be done by the end of the day and I will need to reboot phone have rebooted this morning though.
I suspect whatever issue in vodafone that stopped then swapping my sim is preventing the number being transferred?
Oh ffs phone numbers weren't imported from outlook.
Really hope I haven't lost them all.
Burn it all to the ground.
Ok no all details are still there just aren't exported / imported.
Ok it is google's fault for not being able to import a column called 'mobile phone' as the fuckig phone number.
The import on google contacts which uses some third party to grab them directly isn't getting numbers iether.
Ok I finally got it except now I have like 2 or 3 of every contact.
Now at least I can tell my parents I'm not dead.
Ok I finally got it except now I have like 2 or 3 of every contact <- that just happens with android.
There should be a thing somewhere to link contacts so like.
It'll merge contacts where it sees matching numbers or whatever.
I am grab they finally added that.
Contact merging was one of the innovating things abotu windows phone.
I haven't used an android phone in over 3 years remember!
Was on the first android I had.
Which was easily over 3 years old.
Shit maybe it's just an HTC thing.
Going from my HTC to Nexus was easy even with the encoding difference of a couple of files.
And then my Nexus 7 synced up just wonderfully when I got it.
Noelor nah I just did it now.
Maybe I missed it before.
Or it's been more than 3 years.
I can check amazon!
Well I guess if that's when you got your windows.
It'd be a couple years before that you got whatever android.
True my android phone was a year pre-cambridge.
Early 2011 first android 2.3 phone.
Finishing off this story.
I based the protagonist on Nina but called her Ying because giving all the characters chinese names helps setting feel a lot.
Step 1 of editting find/replace Nina for Ying.
So I see Kreiger Cyril and Archer....
Maybe it's the light but XCOM Pam and Lana do not look right. at all.
None of the ladies basically.
I assume that's also supposed to be... Cheryl? whatever her name ended up being.
Well she's definitely not one of those three.
Aye true enough. Which is the problem.
The problem with the ladies is none of their dress is really available.
And the faces alone are not enough.
Because you have 3 faces per gender.
And you can't make pam look like pam because her body shape just isn't available.
While true I meant just skin and hair colours seem p. fuct.
In case you need to name a baby boy who is a sword?
Because you have 3 faces per gender <- while it's not a whole bunch more isn't it 3 per gender/ethnicity pair?
Doesn't help this situation much though.
Terible bikes in polish but its mostly pictures.
There is a non-polish version somewhere.
The hell clothing is this.
A plastic sun tunic I guess?
Also she is wearing clips on her wrists.
Noelor did you find a site with post apocalyptic fashion ?
I notced they had a boysuits header.
I just slammed tunic into g-image to check if they are supposed to have sleeves.
Thats a category alright.
Not what I would call bodysuits.
I'd kinda say sleeveless really.
I'm just going to go with the idea that this is in fact a shadowrun website.
That leaked into our world.
This is... kinda cool.
Like maybe past the shoulders but not to the elbow.
Albeit dunno why there's a hole in the back.
Dob yeah basically what I'm getting.
You planning a tron cosplay now.
When you need to dress for mid winter with your face but raggedy desert adventure for your torso down.
If you're in a desert you keep as much covered as you can.
I'm more concerned with.
That is not how you hat.
I linked from the thumbnail.
It snot terrible or anything.
Okay no that third image is just look the model has hard nipples.
Every bit of this site reveals new weird stuff.
I think it's a cult.
<- this physicall hurts me.
Why do people do this.
Oh didn't know there was a torbjorn comic already too.
Noelor this is not OKAY.
This is not okay at all.
I think it's sfw but it really seems like it shouldn't be.
Is it ten pages of him hammering a turret then a page saying potg then 2 random pages repeated?
198 euro for that nonsense too.
Dob he's falling off a platform as it says PotG.
BwaS somewhere along the way he complains about MY TURRET.
MoonWolf omg I hadn't even.
Also AssCreed snuck in.
I'm not sure if this makes her awful cockney accent more or less excusable.
Noelor turns out yorkshire accents are just FUCKING WEIRD ?
MoonWolf that's not news.
But nah she's still doing faux-cockney British for Tracer.
I have to believe it's put on because nobody actually speaks like Tracer.
I just had assumed she was a yank.
Okay thats a pretty good cockney.
But could you sond a litlle more fake and weird ?
Dick Van Dyke or bust.
Can we just call her Tracy Poppins from now on?
Oh right I went there to find VA.
According to this he is from New Jersey.
Opens with Manhattan Project quote good stuff.
Noelor guess thats why they need the giant omnic fighting robots in volskaya.
This guy is pretty great.
Anathema i'm sorry crossfit was in the name so i didn't look at it.
I'm sure it's a great one of that though.
MoonWolf don't worry he rags on it.
You think I'd link something pro-crossfit!?
Cross and fit both seem like things you'd like.
I do not they do silly exercises that hurt people and encourage people to over-exert themselves also leading to injury.
Well that does sound bad.
Shit 30m until we leave the office for paintball and I've not finished lunch.
It's a lot of food.
Normal food is garbage.
Takes so long to eat.
Doesn't take 30 minutes.
Cannot wait for my extra-protein bertrand to arrive.
Unless you are eating one hell of an epic lunch.
MoonWolf I've been eating for longer than that already.
Ok I think I physically cannot eat any more.
Eating a whole bunch so soon before painball seems less than ideal incidentally.
You'll give yourself a stitch or whatever.
We aren't starting until 4 so if I stop now I should be OK.
It's way out in the country then I guess?
GlennCuttlefish i'll trade you.
4c less and twice as much wind!
Oh if only there was wind.
Having my window open might actually do something.
It's not twice as much.
The km/h numbers are the same.
But thats just a rounding error.
The mph which incidentally the p is per so the / is nonsensical is just rounding differently.
Noelor look right i'm just trying to trade some weather here.
Stop bringing in facts.
You're not helping me get 21C and clear skies.
Time to crawl around in a muddy forest in 12C.
I feel goat sim is getting a little out of hand.
Make fried latex of six Tracers thanks ChaosSmurf.
Back in a couple of hours or so.
MoonWolf I don't suppose you have any guesses as to why the media buttons on my keyboard don't work while I'm in Open Office?
Incidentally I'm going to bow out of tonight's game.
I *think* I'm on track to finish writing in time but better to play it safe.
's more important anyway.
GlennCuttlefish MairBear guess we're playing more overwatch instead of 13th age.
Also I'd rather take a break between finishing the story and writing the dumb essay than barrel right through in order to have both done before game.
Oh hey it's Penny Arcade's one good/accurate comic for the year.
Noelor it is indeed not wrong.
Trigger while i was in the kitchen.
Relatedly today's DoA has the fuckoff hugest TW I've ever seen TW TWs.
Turns out the kitten commited suicide!
Editting is not supposed to make a story longer.
It's in-budget so w/e.
So play charge and windfury minions the brawl.
Has Flare finally found a use?!
MoonWolf I wonder if Choose One minions will work properly.
I'm sure they broke a previous brawl though I've forgotten which now.
I'd try but brawl will be back in 1 hour.
Probably because choose ones are not technically battlecries.
Yay woke up in time boo it wasn't game.
Brb then and then more Time to Get Mad at Video Games?
MairBear get mad at HS first ?
HS isn't a video game now?
It's less Na-sty than OW.
GlennCuttlefish would you care to get sad and mad with me?
Guess I can do that for a bit. Got dinner soonish however.
Hrmm turns out I only ever drew 1 Flare from classic booster S.
THE PALADIN GROWLS TAKE OFF TH AT HELMET CITIZEN. I COMPLY REVEALING THE SECOND SMALLER HELMET UNDERNEATH. THE PALADIN SCREAMS DEFEATED.
Wondering if this tb makes magma rager playable...
Haha opponent concedes turn 6 from a coined out emperor ^^.
Awright that's that 5 TB wins q completed.
Link closely c'thun gnome is really fun in this ^^.
And then they fucked.
For ... spamming lmb.
A job well done.
Huh you can open social tab in OW and prefer or Avoid players you recently played with.
Just prefer all the bastions.
I got shot in the butt last night.
Well you were going to get shot somewhere.
Might as well be in the butt ?
The only bruise I've got is my forearm.
The finnish subdued quiet public facade that completely shatters once you pump them full of liquor. also their booze. Snrk.
Unless you're one of those who only become even more quiet when exposed to alcohol.
Cooked_Auto is that the original voice actor.
It sounds like it.
For the German dub? Hell if I know.
No one really keeps track of localization VA's.
Ftrbzzs getting a new phone soon?
Anathema do you just like having none of the apps others do ?
Jolla is a great phone if you don't want anything to work.
Jolla C is powered by Sailfish OS in its purest form without any pre-installed 3rd party apps. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY.
MoonWolf / ChaosSmurf / Mu do you remember the cooperative turn-based dnd4-esque in-browser RPG we played like 4+ years ago? you'd go on quests and stuff?
Do you remember the name?
I tried googling a little but am at work and turn based in-browser rpg gets a lot of garbage results p.
Seo bullshit and lists have made this thing basically unfindable.
If it even still exists.
Guess I'll trawl my email.
Do you know what year we probably played it?
I can't remember if it was before or after I moved to cambridge.
I want to say before ?
I think that is more likely.
But i can't be sure.
I remember I bought stuff from it so I should have an email for that least somewhere...
Email top re sexually transmitted diseases and other toxic gunge and he top item in the chain is me sharing a file via the corporate website of my first job #professional.
Butts cvannot find it.
It was after we layed WAR though right?
The writing was really good I wanted to check it out again.
Paypal wont show be anything older than may 2013 wtf.
Ok its not there.
Ok never gonna find it.
I want to do something dumb anathema.
Maybe you can help me.
I have a whole load of classes with the same interface.
I want to instanciate one of them at random weighted but thats not an issue and instanciate that one.
I want to avoid large sets of nested selection bullshit.
Ideally i could just store them in a list or something.
No clue how or even if you can do that.
Do they all have parameterless constructors?
Something like Assembly.GetTypes.Wheret => typeofIMyInterface.IsAssignableFromt should get you the types pick one at random then do `IMyInterface foo = Activator.CreateInstancetype`.
Hmm if i gave them static properties i could filter them further.
What are you doing? this sounds kludgy as hell I love it.
Okay so I'm building something to programatically generate HS cards.
I made card effects like if they have charge or stealth or do 3 damage classes.
Because some of them can nest.
And i need to select them at random.
So i could generate a random number and make a giant switch statement.
But that felt like it'd be a massive mess.
Perhaps technically more proper.
TIL its possible when doing F# to add an item to a project file and keep working but then be unable to re-open that project file once you close it.
Because order of files matters and if you have a folder which is above some source files and then add an item to the folder VS puts it at the bottom and then wont open because it would render the folder twice in the solution explorer.
GetTypes for an interface also gets you the actual interface.
Do you need to call it on the interface?
I get a t.isinterface on that.
Thanks anathema this may technically be uglier because it uses reflection.
But its way earier to use and maintain.
Reflection has its place.
The image you just linked.
Features all OW's old people.
Oh reinhardt i get it.
Nah all of them.
They're the oldest 4 in the cast afaict.
Oh only 31 technically.
Anathema some more reflection fuckery and attributes later i can filter them too.
Are you fetching static properties from the type?
No runtime effect exposes GetCustomAttributes.
And thats just a list i can linq at.
We have a buttload of custom attributes.
So now i can write my effects decorat with attributes as fitting and it'll just work.
And its just a 30 line method to fetch whatever i want intead of a sprawling mess.
So cards have a collection of capabilities? each capability is an instance of a class implementing a specific interface?
Cards have a whole bunch of stuff.
But the Text of the card is a list of TextEffects.
Usually just one or two.
That all implement ITextEffect.
But some of them can nest.
So one texteffect might just be Charge.
Which is just simply that and a cost of 3.
But another one might be Deathrattle do 3 damage to a random enemy minion.
Which is a Deathrattle effect.
With a do x to a random enemy minion.
With a nested do 3 damage.
All of which are ITextEffects.
I'm not sure this makes sense.
But it makes sense in my head.
And since this isn't really intended to be used by other people.
No I get it.
Heh my querybuilder kind of does something similar.
You can have filters which due to 'and' and 'or' can nest but everything implements IWriteable.
I'm not sure how fast this really is.
Good that it doesn't have to scale.
Unless it needs to be called hundreds of times per second or have the call finish in a very short time don't worry about it.
It just runs on my pc and generates a few thousand cards at time.
Compared to the neural net its eventually going to feed its fucking lightspeed.
Even if it takes 10 minutes to do it.
Which it won 't.
Its'll be be milliseconds.
Most of which will be console writeline time i bet.
I fret about the speed of things like reflection because most of the reflectiony stuff is in nancy response handlers and 1ms vs 100ms makes a difference when responding to web calls p.
Fucking console writing is so slow.
Yeah fair enough on the web stuff.
Have to implement one-2-many relationships now...kinda ran out of steam.
Noelor HOW MANY OTHER CRISPS COME IN A TUBE!?
Noelor do you remember the online in-browser co-op fantasy dnd4-esque game we played a long time ago?
Nah I was looking through my emails before.
I reckon it was 2012 but nothing.
Cheers for tryin though m8.
Totes found it.
I figured it'd died by now.
Its giong on steam soon!
Also just found it.
Noelor only off by one year.
So was that still before anathema moved to cambridge ?
I moved Sept '11.
Guess i was way off then.
I remember because its the year Skyrim came out.
It was before he moved within Cambridge.
Harder task than finding the game again figuring out my login.
Know what else was going on in my email inbox back then?
May 2013 that is.
Anathema password recovery is your friend ?
Exalted 3rd Edition Kickstarter.
MoonWolf tried for Anathema no email yet.
This looks kind of cool.
That does look cool.
Lets hope its actually also a good game.
Instead of a good trailer.
Ok I got my login.
You know how hair and whatever accumulates at the drain of a shower and so sometimes you have to clean it out?
I think the same is happening with the drain in my back yard where all the water pipes from both my flat and upstairs end.
Not the waste pipes thankfully.
Those go actually down into the ground.
It is filled with frogs?
We cleaned out the drainage pipe on the frontside of the house a couple of years ago and it was jam packed with decomposing leaves and had clogged it almost completely.
MoonWolf want to play some overwatch?
This is going places.
Are the places away?
Crunchyroll subs correct a couple of names in Stardust Crusaders pt 2.
Possible to make them seem less ridiculous?
Yay got play pof the game in my first overwatch match.
Except it's really obvious because they're still saying names in the audio.
So I know this character the subs call Cool Ice is supposed to be Vanilla Ice.
Noelor yaeh you don't correct jojo's dumb names.
They are supposed to be dumb.
Half of them are in fact already dumb ENGLISH names.
In that game I killed a bunch of people by doing D.va's rocket boost -> self-destruct the mech keeps going forward while it the fuse is going down.
Try lobbing it in an arc from above.
That's enough gaming for tonight I think.
New modem hooked up this evening and now down speed up to 2.5x the previous.
I fucken love D.va.
Enjoy having a massive headshot box in th emiddle of your model.
IZOMBI IS FROM ROB THOMAS.
Guess I gotta watch that.
MoonWolf yeah but robot.
Robot is pretty good.
If you really want to have fun with your robot.
Play a game of the brawl.
Maybe tomorrow going to bed now well reading for an hour until the adrenaline fades P.
That's the good thing about being shit at videogames still get the feels.
No wonder Young Justice was so good the guy behind Gargoyles was involved.
It's a miracle.
I'm sure Noelor will enjoy this.
Redeye unboxing a 40 stack of OW loot boxes. He's a bit salty he's not seeing legendaries XD.
> build bullshit 1/2 drop deck for the low mana minion daily quest.
> finley rerolls to totem.
> spawn healing totem as priest.
Aa sorry MoonWolf didn't notice that request until now.
MairBear that pair of games was an exercise in How many ways can Reinhardt annoy his healer?
Method one constantly run out of Lucio's range.
Method two constantly spam the Heal me ping whenever Mercy's not looking at you for more than a second.
Noelor what about charging off to maybe pin one person everytime he's under fire.
A nuance of number one.
This morning I got ejected out of my mech over the edge of the map to my death.
Gah sitting across from a sales person is awful.
So many phone calls.
Ftrbzzs no offence p.
Actually we don't make that many phone calls..
And we have meeting rooms for video/conference calls.
We're not completely heartless salespeople -.
Anathema what we'd like to get in the future are these small phone booths.
Anathema like this but customised with our colours.
Maybe for the next office.
There are 3 small booths in the new office but I don't know if have phones in them but they definitely don't have PCs in them so not very useful if people need to refer to things.
Yeah those ones we're looking at would have a place for your laptop.
And we only use mobile phones so that's fine.
Trufax .net core is a fucken mess right now.
I kinda understand the unity / uwp shit.
Though suspect politics were the reason it was pushed.
Wtf at the web browser shit.
Stop that STOP THAT.
Confused about what is going to happen to Mono now.
Right now they're not decoupling.
They are rebuilding the whole thing.
For no good reason.
But keeping mono as is around because... ?
I just want to run my fsharp crap on *nix atm neither mono nor .net work for that mono is missing APIs .net is just not finished.
Is mono missing f# related api's or just the things you are trying to use specifically ?
The the fuck are the misssing encrypt.
No response in their bug trackers.
There was a patch available 7 years ago which claims that it will fix this issue lol.
That comment is from 2014.
Maybe they should have merged it 9 years ago then.
OK oracle has a handy INSERT WHEN.
Stealing the MYSQL api.
My overwatch experience.trf.
Surprised this wasn't a ChaosSmurf article.
Anathema cs wouldn't have included doom 3 in his theories.
I don't think he's a big fan of it.
But here have a cat in a dog show.
All these dogs that are smaller than the cat should be removed from this show fucking tiny dogs.
Yeah most tiny dogs are the worst.
The puppies are fine but some of these.
Shouldn't even get the name dog.
My cousins...I wonder what hybrid it is...dachshund and french bulldog? is pretty great when its not doing its annoying yappy little ship routine.
I will never trust a dog I can lift with the palm of my hand.
But at least they ain't cats.
Back later for game!
Mair left the channel like 3 minutes ago.
Back later for game!
5 at this point.
I sat down with my Fellowship notebook to sketch out things to happen tonight.
Set music to shuffle.
All I wanna be is someone who gets to see a Giant Woman.
Should I take this as a sign y/n?
The answer is yes.
Race of giant women?
I wish 美 weren't such a pain to write.
It's very horizontal therefore squished vertically because 字 are supposed to be square-ish.
I'm not sure you meant that character in specific.
Or whatever that character means.
Nah Thunder is quicker to write.
Why are reaction videos a thing?
Anathema they've been commercialised and make a lot of money.
Ok but only because people watch them.
Why do people watch them?
Am I just old? _.
Try asking some people.
Saving this to my reactions folder.
Reinstalled Space Marine. Found the old mod I used to run with that gives you an infinite ammo portable autocannon. Ahhh.
My wildlock demonology deck took a very long time to draw its Mal'Ganis third last card remaining conveniently just after mage opponent dropped a 10/10 c'thun against about 5 imps and voidwalkers.
Up to r16 now ^^.
Well thats the Warcraft movie seen.
It was pretty okay. Strangely accurate in a sense.
It had a couple of nice references too and some gorgeous vista shots.
My inner monologue tonight.
I've fucking had it with virtual dice.
And any sort of random elements in games.
But what are they scrolling ?
Shut up. I'm Dingo! Oh god the dialogue in this game.
Noelor someone else said Good half followed by several ghs.
I think mystery solved.
Yeh that's become pretty standard for dva potg.
Noelor I am starting to suspect Mary is not really a nun.
Mary is a pretty nun-ish name.
Yes but something about her character makes me doubt this claim.
Dunno what you're on about mate.
Just because she's not wearing her... habit?
Roadhog needs a clown skin.
I'd prefer one on roadhog.
Heroes has about 20 new needs a day. If you fall into that abyss there's no way out.
I'm already in the abyss.
Thats the only one I can think of that would fit the game.
Because not going to lie I want to pull people in and punch them.
SCIENCE MAY HAVE GONE TOO FAR.
Well time to see how todays dinner experiment turned out.
Made some kind of minced animals + vegetables stew.
's hard to make a truely bad stew.
Well I dont hate this.
I mean its not the best stew I have tasted but I cant afford the ingredients for that so I cant even try making it.
Well combined with the potatoes this stew is actually pretty good. Not sure I'll ever make it again since it takes too much effort but for this time it gets my stamp of approval.
This is also pretty amazing.
I'd like to point out the reaper tracer duel in the backgroun on the rooftops.
MoonWolf so I'm playing against a zoolock right?
Then on turn 8 two C'thun cards come out.
That can happen some are good enough to play without C'thun.
C'thun is in their deck.
On the whole its not a bad idea i mean i don't know if its competitive.
But having a 10 or so damage drop at the end there doesn't sound bad.
Help close out a game.
Down at R20 though.
Lost a hearthstone game cos I didn't have a dragon in hand when I uh... played blackwing x.
I'm so sorry friend.
HEROES NEVER DIE *resses all the bosses you killed before this*.
Have fun with that gauntlet.
Priest could have killed me BM'd instead I had pyroblast in my hand.
Noelor ooh a free epic of your choice!
Namely second Ice Block.
Was a genuine personal query ahead of the F1 this afternoon.
Moon is the superior.
In more ways that one P.
I dunno KT is first pick first ban material in the meta right now.
My team just got me the Undying acheive.
Isn't that clear Naxx 10 with no deaths?
After the beta I've come to the conclusion that I'd rather go against a bastion than a mccree.
An opponent surrendered because I summoned Thaurissan.
Oh there's a new clan tag or whatever you wanna call 'em on SA.
Noelor there is a whole series for overwatch.
One for each series.
One for overwatch in general.
One for each hero*.
Noelor> did they have answer on the board for emperor? I imagine if they didn't or in hand 2 turns of emperor reduction is one they'd give up against.
He's pretty decent in the brawl this wk.
10 dust a lightning bolt a cold blood and an abom S.
There was a tgt one y'day with 4 dusted commons and a 1-kvaldir.
Unlike that pack though.
Wild weapon/pirate warrior is amazingly fun.
Not sure if competitive.
But great fun hitting people in the face with 6/3 or bigger arcanite reapers.
I've laddered higher in wld than std this month. Mal'Ganis lock got me a bit of a streak the other day.
It feels wild has more people there to just play weird stuff.
Wild casual especially is a weird combination of super tryhard decks and really weird stuff.
So many games I get a couple turns in then pandaren cultist comes out and it completely throws me off as they're not really playing a c'thun archetype class.
Its just a good card.
Also C'thun C'THUN C'THUN!
I haven't drawn one yet.
Gets flamewaker spellslinger antonidas 4 spells and draws ysera.
Sure is hearthstone D.
MairBear gets 'em cheap too.
And then a palading gets exact lethal.
The turn AFTER nefarian gave me a lay on hands.
6 losses and counting this morning. Good good good.
And today everyone BMs.
You can win MairBear.
I believe in you.
It's the second to last day.
Of course everyone's tryharding that one shaman deck B.
Over an hour and 3 ranks dropped for 2 priest wins x.
>potg as lucio for killing a dva + pilot.
At times I worry about the mental health of people on internet.
Perfect spring day if anything.
Oh yeah perfect lawn mowing weather.
Can i have your lack of clouds plz ?
Link is so fabulous.
I just played a priest v priest game in hearthstone.
And genuinely have a headache now.
...Shifting Shade gave me Jaraxxus.
You shift jaraxxus shifting lord of the shifting legion.
MoonWolf I've been playing dragon priest for my daily.
How's that going for you.
And Museum Curator has given me two Deathwings so far.
Regular or dragonlord ?
Ie the one with deathrattle.
Did you manage any actual big drops ?
If you see me log into and out of HS a lot.
This time still on turn 7.
My opponent is uh.
Pirate control c'thun warrior?
Who just played Rag.
They wrecked me before I could play Deathwing =<.
Otoh after conceding two priest v priest at the mulligan screen my next game starts with curating yet another Dragonlord!
Against another c'thun warrior -_-.
Not having much luck today.
I actually beat them.
They used their biggest removal on Deathwing summoning Nefarian and Ysera and an Azure Drake for me.
Anyway quest's finally done.
That is sadly the best way to treat deathwing dragonlord if you are not paladin nuke it early in the hope it won't be too bad.
Because very turn its up its 12 damage to the face and more chances for you to draw dragons.
Azure's one of those ubiquitous cards I still havent seen...
Only got 1 argus too.
Any random totem golem.
It's also Flametongue very often.
When it's your totemic it's searing.
Maybe wrath when all the spell cards in your deck are burned.
I was like handsoap... why is he asking for handsoap?
Noelor its very complicated.
You know what t he best part of doing that is.
You get meter for the full health they had when they died from falling.
Aww yiss zenyata PotG.
Killed a soldier mercy and just resurrected soldier again solo.
Ah yeh saw that one.
Seeing all these something-range hunters pulling call of the wild perfectly on curve. Tilts me man.
Goddamnit show you were supposed to be about a cute miko doing stupid things with bears.
Not about social anxiety and making the miko cry.
This is why I'm sticking with Luluco.
Oh please as if luluko wasn't about breaking the policegirls heart half the time P.
MairBear fucking priest mirrors.
I'd won that like 6 turns ago.
Takes forever to close out.
I've found a new core exercise more fun than regular leg raises not sure if it is as beneficial though but w/e.
They have this new rig which is the edges of a metal cube.
There are bars along the top spaced about 2-3 foot apart I can hang from one with my hands and touch the next one with my feet.
They have a childrens playground thingy.
It has other bits.
But I'm just using it for the monkey bars yes p.
MoonWolf up for a round of Glenn getting angry at overwatch?
I am amused at how angry you get while playing zenyatta.
I'm at my calmest when playing zeny.
Well we started inviting you to next round.
Having proper food for lunch today.
Chicken kale and spinach in a mushroom white wine and tarragon sauce.
Flavour is a little weak but it is really good.
I only need to eat another...100g this evening _.
Seems faster looking at the trees.
My weather app is giving me 17mph.
Fuckingers stole my idea.
Explain it so I don't have to fire up my sekrit proxy.
There needs to be a combo / teamwork whatever play of the game type.
That handles thing slike blizzard / graviton surge and then someone else taking all the kills.
How do you code for that easily? p.
They record a whole match and during that they keep track of likely plays of the game.
If you end up with two of those and they have an overlapping time fragment and inside that time fragment is many kills on which both player contributed.
Combo play of the game.
I realize thats not exactly a working solution yet.
But as far as i understand the game the information to do it is there.
They just need to actually make it.
Its the only explenation.
His name is in the potg!
MoonWolf find this earlier.
Made a note to link it tomorrow.
Seen it before but it is good to watch if anyone hasn't yet.
I'm fairly sure he's wrong about how he thinks the shutdown works.
It doesn't predict into the future how valuable the ult was.
It just gives a shitton of points.
MoonWolf the top comment.
I don't see comments.
Ok I'm still very confused.
Now that's dickish.
MoonWolf the trick with overlaps though.
Is you'd bump up even more against the equivalent of *Torbjörn falls off a cliff*.
Where two players do a thing simultaneously but at opposite ends of the map.
Assuming the rest of that model is correct.
GlennCuttlefish done with the friends.
Still taking a break. There is only so much bullshit I can take before I get angry at videogames again.
Kirisu you can tweak.
Welp we have crossed the rubicon.
For instance you can label some of the obvious abilities support abilities.
If a mei threw down a blizzard that overlapped a lot of kills with someone else.
Graviton surge earth shatter.
Those are all really obvious setups to combos.
Mercy healing or damage boosting.
So you can get mercy healing a farah so she can actually Finishg her justice.
Probs better to check for conditionals.
Are >50% these people you killed frozen.
Were you being healed for >50% of this PotG snippet?
Doesn't really work for sponatious combinations though.
But i have no clue what it means.
To me it just looks like an elaborate vOv.
Grabbing symbols for every assembly takes a while.
The shrug emoji I was expecting wasn't there.
Anathema every assembly ?
The fuck are you doing.
You say elaborate CA.
It takes a while longer to find the symbols and all for that.
I still think v0v looks more like a choral singer than a shrug.
We should have PatternSpider put that table back.
MoonWolf add that function asap.
I have made it an issue.
I'm sure i'll get to it sometimes.
The true enemy of humanity or what have you.
I want that intro though tbh.
Even though I never Symmetra.
Finally a youtuber that does it right.
I feel that image really captures Mercies general posing.
I'm fine with this.
MoonWolf trying to get a better callstack than external code.
Did it help ?
Need to swap references I think |.
Get to play with our custom VS extension though.
All it does is turn package dependencies into project dependencies.
> drop triple kill with dvabomb.
> helden sterb nicht.
I know it's sterben but the sound file kinda blurs the -en into the n-.
Who knows Swiss German might do it a bit differently.
Thought I saw a ReaperName. Turns out it was on Bastion.
If Illydan is nihilistic sure.
You clearly were not prepared.
My body fat is 9-10 and I want to cut to 6 what a bastard.
Erm I'm gonna need you to label that axis for me.
So they arnie or something?
All these posts C_A.
Making me want to Mercy.
But if I mercy for pugs I'm all supported out by the time I get to comptent glenns.
2 mins in your 5 members scatter show critical on your screen then complain of no healz.
BwaS or a hungry skellington.
4 members scatter I abandon the one i ws with who blinks/dash/whatever elses a mile aaway.
MairBear LShift after them duh.
I chase them again and they ran behind a corner. Where awaits the enemy reaper/roadhog/mccree.
More LoS blocks than a 3v3 arena in Ring of Trials Nagrand.
Your friend yesterday was cool.
They should maybe try more than one hero though >.>.
MoonWolf Dumbing of Age finished the mini-arc of Carla's Cold Swift and Absolutely Ridiculous Revenge Upon Mary for her Transphobic Assfacery.
So scrolling through his tumblr is fun.
Minister and by fun you mean infuriating ?
Here's a compilation post.
I'm not reading his comments section.
If it's even open.
Probably for the best.
There's a summary in an ask though.
Wherein apparently some people are choosing to take this arc as glorification of violence toward women.
Oh god the violence of pie to the face.
Shouldn't have left found more fun in webcomic tumblr time.
MoonWolf so salty over a tracer ult killing 3.
And then me preesing heroes never die.
And the tracer getting potg.
Minister haha I will pass the message along p.
End of probationary period for one colleague so we got some cake -.
I can sleep on my left shoulder again.
I hope you're happy Cooked_Auto.
I've implented a years old meme.
Also anathema will be happy.
I set the windowsize back to 2.
Like a Hot Topic butterfly.
Turns out i externalized that to a config files ages ago and forgot >.>.
MoonWolf MairBear up for a round of angerwatch?
I'll join if one round turns into more but should get lunch and stuff.
I'll have to pass until I have a few K game under my belt. Just get catapulted up to an MMR hell when I grp with you guys.
You say that.
The # of players has way more to do with it.
We'd actually get annoyed at you for not being on mumble =P.
When we're shouting ie Bastion's behind the point deal with it!
I like the word 'waypoint'.
I give it a 3/5.
Bah. sorry about that outburst moonwolf. I can take losing or I can take faulty gear but losing because my keyboard stops respoding was too much.
I need to do game prep for tonight and figure out food.
And i got my level.
Levels are great moments to stop.
It's losing to bad players making worse plays than me that tilts me.
>getting mad at videogames.
Hm. Wonder if my USB receiver is overheating.
That a thing that can happen ?
Because I only seem to get that kind of input lag in games.
But the usb dongle is considerably warmer than my other USB doohickeys.
Anathema can't blame everything on them.
Black matter then.
Maybe I'll continue on the stupid mercy SD doodle insetad of getting angry at videogames for a while.
Verymuch a WIP.
Not sure I'll ever actually finish it just something I doodled because I had 15 minutes to kill.
GlennCuttlefish is she angry at bad tanks or just a wip standin face?
Well I dug deep for my emotions when playing mercy you can probably guess.
Museum Curator into Sylvanas and 2 other choices. Nicking off with 1/3 of a midrange hunter call of the wild drop.
And oozing out a full charge eaglehorn.
If is representative my gym is pretty good.
Anathema you're seeing a thread of the worst things peple have seen.
Probably one of those things happened once to one of these.
I hate bulking. I hate chicken breast. I hate protein shakes. I hate that my TDEE is 2900. Gained 20 pounds over the last 6 months and all of a sudden my weight gain as well as progress in my lifts have halted. That is all.
The wednesday rant thread in hots used to be great.
Now it's dominated by one guy coming back each week on a script complaining one specific char hasn't been imported yet.
Gets all of the points every time and there's 20 imitators crowding out legitimate ranting.
That was the wrong link.
Do you mind re-pasting the one after that?
That was the wrong link < was it though ?
MoonWolf omg I need to uninstall HS forever.
Failed to lethal ?
But then I miss clicked windfury.
And then he deathwinged.
The elephants misguided you.
Trash meme that Thrall's elements guide me is elephants.
Turn one play tunnel trogg turn 9 punch the hunters face with an 11/3 trogg.
Becauuse he only went face.
Rather than do 3 damage to the growing threat.
Furthest I think I've got one is about 5.
Trogg and northshire basically seem to have taunt when I play them or like the mage secret spellbender.
MairBear what's Get Down's actual name?
!hs Noble Sacrifice.
With your not listing tokens.
Has a sick golden animation.
Cooked dinner again O.
Also met my new neighbours.
How social of you.
It is a hetero couple I walked out to go to the shops just as the guy was saying so who is respinsible for that bit? and pointing to my slightly messy lawn p.
Maybe more than slightly ?
It's not that bad.
Lawns are awful anyway.
Anathema lawns are super awful in America.
They're less offensive here.
Yanks have them because their ancestors had them here and in parts of europe with similar latitude.
Most of them now live in climates grass isn't suited to though.
So they take a loooot of maintenance.
I'd still rather have clover and wild flowers though.
Nicer to look at.
Totes saw in my garden at the weekend.
Fucking bastard of a priest mirror played mind control on my chromaggus. Two turns in a row. Who runs double fucking mind control.
Go from one brawl where I get a yogg play and lose to another where the lock lucks out and gets reno with activation ofc.
Nicks off with an animated armour and taps away.
Before sprinting to fatigue to deny me the pleasure of kicking his fucking arse once I finally started winning.
Annnd the pack yield is 10 dust 2 neutral commons and a rogue weapon rare yay~.
Anathema your failure to be invisible once again came to our aid.
Oh great the new high skill floor glass cannon who can 2-shot you from halfway across the map is getting buffed in HotS.
As opposed to don't worry that's gonna get nerfed from her launch trailer.
Just because her swift adopters haven't figured out how to play her yet tch typical.
< Noelor MoonWolf.
Game needs a opposition got potg / potg on our team despite defeat so the clip show can fuck right off option.
My failure to be invisible?
Vaynivah is still in the game?
Or how ever I spelled it.
Anathema died yesterday.
Noelor did it.
Morag Tong was contracted to kill the party.
At least she died doing what she loved killing people for money.
Also you broke into Vivecs office.
Was obese all my life. Now that I'm slimming down and actually working with a good regimen my calves look more and more like a ballsack in a good way. wat.
Anathema this is some interesting ideas of what calves should look like.
Why are you doing this to me moonwolf.
Not sure about good.
Wish it was like 3C warmer.
Wish it was 10c cooler.
Went to check the thermometer by the window.
It shows 29c.
GlennCuttlefish seems a bit early for 29c.
Had 28C at its height yesterday.
Are you calling my thermometer a liar moonwolf?
Local site says its around 26c.
It is cold here.
Anathema +236C here by the sea.
+26C forecasted for the afternoon.
I am disappointed that Lucio's skin named after doesn't change anything to be like having synesthesia.
Nice wolf skin for hanzo.
Seems very accurate.
Time to master him.
No more tanking or supporting allowed.
Thats sounds like a very bad idea.
Good lord thats a drop.
Ah no wait forgot it was between there.
Also account from the coldest part of the day to the warmest.
Still about what we have now so but colder nights would've been nice.
MoonWolf fuck the Radchaai language's treatment of vowels btw.
A narrator helps!
You don't say.
The aai in radchaai.
What about it ?
Was that long-a + i or short a + ai?
In the audio book that I can only assume Leckie was consulted on.
Ok that's what I was assuming.
Short a into diphthong ai.
MoonWolf yeah this is my kind of shit.
All in on the linguistics.
Tyvm for the recommendation.
Down to 81kg may hit my goal of under 80kg by July after all.
Just ate lunch -> still hungry.
Anathema eat more.
Time for food slush.
Yesss someone did the thing.
Pls note that for when I can hear sound without an office full of people also hearing.
Because from the description alone very yes.
!note Noelor.
MairBear that was amazing.
Broad wrists are negatively associated with total body fat and positively associated with fat free mass and vice versa curse my tiny wrists.
I'm struggling to parse that.
Anathema wants big wrists because it makes you look toned as shit.
Wrist and ankle breadth are correlated with potential muscle mass.
Now I feel bad for my tiny wrists too c.
MairBear do you want to GET BUFF ?
Who doesn't want to be strong in the real way?
I feel you may have missed the point of that episode.
I'm not sure what you mean.
Who doesn't want to be a Giant Woman.
Time to get mad at flashbangs again!
You're just mad you're not as skilled as all these mcrees.
Ftrbzzs work summer bbq event is the day before my flight D.
Yup my McCree plays are always grenades landing 2 yards too short or 2 yards too wide. Ones that stun successfully well the fanning of the hammer is never on target or hits like a pool noodle.
I feel like a mandrake again.
More so than usual.
Anathema sounds dangerous better not miss the flight!
!note Noelor.
Ftrbzzs but free meats.
The only day of the year where it is worth having Marelino employed.
Anathema well yes.
But there's free meats here too?!
You may regret saying that.

<- this is great.
<- china has a much better player name meta than we do.

How is there so much overwatch fanart.
Seriously there is SO MUCH.
Because its popular.
Which is also why so much filters through our usual browsing channels.
Forbidding all episodes being closed on cliff-hangers to prevent younger children in the audience having 'traumatic tension'. wat.
So i google witcher audiobook.
Just to find out if any of them are on audiobook.
Second result.

Never seen that before.
Okay that one got progressively lazier as it went on.

According to a post on the Frontier forum the developer believes The Engineers shipped with a networking issue that let the NPC AI merge weapon stats and abilities thus causing unusual weapon attacks.

Anyone know if there is a limit to how long gfycat stores things.
Friends birthday is in a 8days so I ripped this wondering if I should post it tomorrow or save it for next friday.
That is very synchronised.
In preparation for the birthday party. I have now ordered 5L of vodka.
Thats a lot of vodka.
Yes yes it is. I assume it will cover the birthday party and one maybe two video game nights.
MoonWolf care to win a hearthstone game? D.
MairBear i shall fire up the hearthy stone.
I shaved a day too late will not have optimium stubble levels for the weekend.
Optimum stubble is none.

It draws Deathwing Dragonlord xD.

But is there thunderbolts and lightning.
Very very frightening?
Yes to the thunder and the lightning.
Not veyr frightening.
Cooked_Auto I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE CRYING.
I TOLD YOU DOG.
Noelor oh dear ?
MoonWolf well I got back and immediately GlennCuttlefish and/or Cooked_Auto arr crying.
MairBear today on the day9 hearthstone videos day9 does 30 minutes of statistics class.
MoonWolf the fuck was that comic.
Young D.va wants to fly.
To maybe go to mcdonalds.
Noelor i guess this makes more sense if you read the backlog of D.va and her moms of Mercy and Farah on that tumblr.
Oh btw a good post for you related to Radch books and How To Prounounce Stuff.
Also this.
Also this.
MoonWolf joining us?
Shotting people ?
Oh god game.
I thought it was saturday for a while there.
Quality hitboxes.
Noelor in Radch books did you get off of the initial planet yet.
I need to knwo this before i link you things that may or may not be spoilers.
Only just got onto the spaceship in the in the past storyline.
Still on ice planet in the current-ish day storyline.
<- i think the idol has been mentioned at this point.
<- this is the short story that sort of explains the short story.
Just you wait.
Noelor i hope you got that was a hamilton thing.
That was perhaps not clear.
Or I wouldn't have given it an A+ grade >.>.
I would have just been confused =P.
Oh gods... been too long since I last had port. Wheee drnuk.
Lemme guess font hidden behind a paywall taller than hellvetica's?
Well some of the asses in overwatch are pretty great.
GlennCuttlefish WHAT.
There's some crazy clipping activation 'errors' that happens when those two interact. Like Portal momentum physics stuff.
At first I was meh.
Then I got to the second half.
Oh my god.
Don't lose your way seems thematic for route 66. navigation and shit.
< Noelor.
No sense of right and wrong.
Just completely lost it when playing bastion ended up in some battle of the bulge tank warfare.
I wonder if that will be one of the brawls.
All bastion all ulti.
Hm first thunderstorm of the year is about to roll in it seems.
Oh dear bloodlust flametongue windfury combo winning tavern brawl turn 5. Ow.
I had a mage/hunter get tundra rhino into call of the wild.
I have to build up an immunity.
Wait.. I lost it.
Well where did you last see it?
Somehow the hive mind of that last map got convinced to go 4 D.Va's. It kinda worked.
Huh. heard nothing of that watching on twitch.
Tragically the streak was not captured on camera nor was it acknowledged by the casters Alexander “Raven” Baguley Ceirnan “Excoundrel” Lowe or PC Gamer writer Simon Sottle Welch who presumably wanted to keep the focus on the card slinging.
That might be why.
Yeh I saw that part.
Like in saw footy broadcasts the camera goes somewhere random commentator goes play interrupted due to some idiot.
I am reminded of the local con's....Mascot?
The rock that cares.
How much does the rock care ?
That has never been disclosed.
We only know that even the rock cares.
It cares about rop.
Does it though?
I don't see what else it would be caring about.
Booze and sauna.
In this round on my team there were thisislewd and lewd.
But was it really lewd?
I think they were both junkrats as well.
When I see those small d.va.
All I can think is.
How are people this bad in videogames.
Its not fucking rocket surgery.
A finely honed talent.
There is a reinhardt he has a shield you stand BEHIND THE SHIELD.
Cultuvated over years.
But nooo these dumbfucks just keep running off and keep getting killed.
No matter how much I spam GROUP UP WITH ME.
GlennCuttlefish what about when you have a Widow shooting your shield.
And the dumbfucks run through the shield to aim better.
Cos big blue shield is too much for their one spare braincell.
Why I'm sticking to vs ai. So much better for the blood pressure.
I'm pretty sure that'd quickly bore me to death.
More fun than getting killfarmed by tracers ppl can't deal with in an mmr hell.
No its not.
Well is to me.
Well this game clearly got tired of my win ratio being above 50%.
I dont think I have won a single game today.
This last match I got put on a defending team where the payload was nearly at the end and even then I got objective time gold.
Finally getting round to seeing where this probability video was going.
So on offense we have reaper me 2x winston a zenyata a sniper and a soldier.
Noelor the... day9 one ?
I watched the here's basic probability part before Fellowship.
Then left it in my Watch Later because it was game o'clock.
Just getting back.
Guess I'm still somewhere above 50% in win ratio but still.
Jesus christ I dont understand how we won that last one.
Is it on your profile page?
Win ratio that is.
There you go.
Well fuck I didn't like bananas anyway.
Brb burning bananas.
Someone almost pulled it off.
Top quality suicide.
Dunno what this prick of a golden p2w renolock is doing stuck at rank fucking 20...
Cthun renolock even.
Again with the bloody matchmaker giving you a 50% win rate down at the fucking bottom so you get nowhere.
King's Elekk. Battlecry reveal your 2nd Fiery Bat. Reveal your opponent's Rag.
Now I'm stuck against a... something or other warrior fusing every turn. It's impossible to tell as he's playing barely anything.
And it's not a hmm what to do fuse. It's a yep 0 mana! fuse.
BwaS probably juts hoping you quit the match early out of frustration.
Hah. the bastard fucked off on my turn 10. Granted I was fusing out /my/ lethal.
Lol some of the Ex3 backer charms have been specifically labeled as non-canon.
With the Apocryphal keyword.
Oh good they added a Fastball Special charm.
They added occult charms for buffing familiars.
As well as a charm to buff Ancient Tongue Understanding.
Its like they were like you know sorcerer familiar zeniths could be Better.
Can you put these on dropbox ?
A resistance charm that buffs Armour-Donning Prana letting you combo it with Call the Blade and also punch people through your vambraces to put them on.
Lol thats what ancient tongue understanding needed alright.
I think i might have been playing a sorcerer wrong.
Clearly what they want from you is to be doing ridiculous sorcerous workings from day 1.
Because they sure as hell enjoy giving you the fucking dicepools for that.
And What Light Reveals lets you TM/HM your pokemon sorry familiar.
Somehow they made even more familiar buffing survival charms.
Because the game needed that ?
People asked for it.
Why would you ask for that.
They are alraedy monsters.
Is lying around.
Sometimes your ship’s mast suddenly explodes. Not a problem if you are one of the Solar Exalted! With this Charm you can quickly build a ship's mast out of whatever.
That is definitely a charm that needed to be added.
MoonWolf they maybe asked for backer charm ideas before releasing the book?
Glorious Solar Ships Mast ?
Mast of Everything.
Oh yeah familiars buffs in sorcery charms are all good.
But making a mast in sail.
Thats Apocryphal alright.
Oh man Rioutous Cry of the Beast.
It's not exactly a supernal extension of natural mortal sailing skills.
Because what i really needed was Battle Groups of Ko and Rama.
The backer wanted a Charm that was as close as possible to the Picard Maneuver great.
That'll be great if someone runs one of the exalted in space in 3e.
Which honestly besides lacking you know non solars.
Will work just fine.
Heaven's Reach does yeah.
Battlestar Autochthon less so imo.
Relies on a lot of the crazy shit running around by late 2e.
I think it can still work might have to change some fluff around infernals ?
Oh it'll work.
I will pay cold hard cash for a proper Heaven.
Just takes way more effort.
You need alchemicals.
Heavens Reach 3e book.
Oh yeah for both really.
You need more splats to just be around.
Since it encourages a lot more play everything encounter everything.
Sure but HR you add Trek-style nonhuman races and so forth instead of more Exalted!
MoonWolf Riotous Cry of the Beast lets you be Squirrel Girl.
Yes that too.
But grants Solar Might to such diminuitive creatures.
Kill world destroying threats with your squirrel army.
Thunder-Quelling Gesture is rad.
Calm the fuck down thunder.
19 Calm the Fuck Down Thunder in Endless Rolling Hills.
Also they added Gem Fusion to Exalted.
I missed that.
Where is that ?
It's literally the last charm.
Didn't get that.
Charm is mechanically overpowered. Use with caution.
Just this one.
The rest of the charms in this book are FINE.
But this one is OP.
Vance talked about it on Twitter.
Mørke hasn't hadn't even seen Steven Universe.
Sure he hasn't.
Anyway 2nd book hasn't even been released yet.
Solars are already at refer to two separate PDFs when choosing charms for your character.
Today's oglaf has A+ oglaf alt-text.
I'd say its more 4/5 oglaf.
I've seen oglaffier.
I meant specifically the alt-text.
Comic is mediocre oglaf.
What did Hearthstone give me 5g for.
Because I know I can't spend 5g on anything.
An arena run can give you 5 gold.
Or something with 5 gold.
My opponent just broke divine shield with wrath.
Didn't draw a card.
Must have really wanted to get rid of the shield.
Honk honk.
TIL Bran on Keeper of Uldaman sets a single minion's stats to 3/3 twice.
Ie the same minion is doubly a 3/3.
My dragon priest Chromaggus started milling me cos my top-decking... token paladin? opponent couldn't get it off the board.
Also Ysera and a number of well I'll need this card for X event sitting there.
Final hurdle of Numbani.
Enemy team has 2 reinhardts.
One shields a torbjurret one shields a bastion. We just crouch behind payload.
They never contest it.
Flipping christ. golden monkey renolock really drew out that game.
Won in the end but no doubt I'll get these stars nicked off with in my next matchup.
Pricks like tht need to realise some of us stuck at the bottom of the ladder have things to do that we didn't come here to play league of legends.
Lost that game cos no one ever thought to kill the opposing mercy D.
I suspect I have too much time today.
Wish they did the too many snipers tip when you had one already.
MairBear but one sniper is usually good.
If only because widomaker is ridiculously powerful in good hands.
GlennCuttlefish Oh yeah I mean if someone mouses over a second sniper.
2 hanzo 1 widow.
This is not a good.
Well thats the next 2 weeks drinks sorted out.
On the menu there is vodka orange juice with vodka apple juice with vodka vodka surprise granberry juice with vodka.
Maybe a beer once in a while if I get bored of vodka.
I have had.
With not enough food.
Because I ended up backing myself into attending a social event where I knew only the host.
Going to find some greasefood to counter.
Great. overwatch crashed so hard it took my IRC client with it.
That is quite the crash.
All these priests who can't deckbuild to save their lives and just get you to build their decks for them can fuck right off.
Where are all these perfect netdecked cthun players getting their defeats from if they're stuck down at 20 plus 0.
MoonWolf.
You have smurf?
I have smurf ?
Do you have a secret second account that has 13 hours reaper? xD.
I have zero secret second smurf account.
And if you check battle.net you'll find i've been plyaing HS for hours.
Hence the confusion.
Dorito.va is precious.
I wish roadhog actually worked.
Seriously most of my hooks pull people to a random location within 5 miles of me.
The mercy one though.
According to this internet thing I can gain another 14kg of lean mass and should lose 4.4kg of fat for optimal bf%.
5 years of lifting until my peak it seems.
Frodan has died his hair pink...
Yeah ages ago.
Well the strength of the pink coming out on some tourney stream tonight bigger than it was last month if it even was then.
Probably redid it.
My quest for that nugget sauce of yesteryear has ended in another failure.
Made a passable tzatziki but not what I needed.
The way this radio play organizes its episode names infuriates me.
So its episode-so-and-so.
Not even nameofshow-episodesoandso.
So I have episode-four-yadayada here.
But then I have episode-9-yadayada.
Why is that random number there.
Why not include the name of the show in the filename.
What is wrong with you people.
Now you might suspect that episode-9 was a transitional period where they make it at least a bit mroe reasonable with numbers.
But no with 10 its episode-ten-yadayada.
Got podcasts that go similar tag them with dd-mm-yy so it then groups 20th feb episode with a 21st jan episode.
Oh and then theres the second new podcast audioplay I picked up after that imgur post.
Listen to better podcasts P.
First episode is filenamed part2012C20Chapter202_20Alice.
I think these people are just fucking with me.
Wait no that was the second episode.
First is 202_20.
You'd love Mr. Robot then.
Oh gods what does that do?
Their first ep is tagged ep 0 they increment correctly but go full leetspeak.
Noelor.
Fun fun shaman down to 3 hp.
Double rockbiters lavaburst lightning-bolts.
24 damage for 6 mana. What is he McCree?
Checks number 24 was right good xD.
Was there a DH in there as well?
Dob oh indeed.
Turn 5 DH turn 6 clear my taunt turn 7 loldead.
Oh dear me. A good Widowmaker is terrifying.
Well this seems interesting.
On the one hand this needs to stop.
On the other I want to see how far the nightmare goes.

Why do I keep forgetting.
Your remaining faith in humanity.
Hahaha brilliant.
MoonWolf could you please at some point today or tomorrow send me a rough top-level description of The Concordance as you see it?
Did that go through?
Well just in case.
I will get you your description today or tomorrow morning.
Preferably by pastie dropbox etc so I can read on here.
How to Treat a Foot Blister 10 Steps with Pictures.
Anathema so you do it right!
Is it wikihow ?
Probably someone fetish then.
Underneath the veneer of usefulness wikihow is the weirdest place.
I went to the social page and found this real quick.
In case the making out isn't doing it!
Well sooner or later making out is going to seem stale.
So clearly spicing it up is necessary.
From the same team that brought you Avatar The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra.
Myeah pretty much.
I have the July 4th picture saved.
This new IP is a part of the Saints Row universe Well this is interesting.
Well its already been invaded by aliens and hell ?
So i mean.
Not much change really.
!hs totemic might.
What the hell.
All games run at half framerate now for some reason.
MoonWolf you don't bother with EGS commentaries right?
Today's NP's Cheerleader would like to learn Bounce!
Very accurate.
P sure one of our M*s linked the original tumble at the weekend.
I linked a bunch of stuff but that wasn't on me.
Noelor a shame.
MoonWolf also this now exists via his patreon.
Well okay then.
Of course that garnered ana's attention.
Prefer this tea time.
This is a good ship.
I'm also p ok with the brown amputee ship.
Prefer Mercy/Pharah more.
Also a good ship.
Don't see why they should be exclusive.
I was talking personal preference here.
Noelor so we need at least mercy to be poly.
So we can enable more ships.
Why do noobs play McCree? - They broke their LMB playing Bastion Hah.
I AM ANGRY NOW MAIR.
FUCKING HANZO AND HIS BULLSHIT.
I thought to pretend it'd be a funny.
But the title gave it away.
Thanks! I didn't sleep very well last night because I was just waiting for this announce to happen so I could stop feeling anxious about it. Oh Chip.
Lie lie lie?
The The The.
HI HI HI.
Hmmmmm kind of tempted.
Although it could've gone without the date stamp.
Minister most feature friend/sibling Lucio.
Also did you see the scuba D.va concept someone did.
Becuase its great.
How I am once again feeling.
GlennCuttlefish heat ?
6 hours of sleep and few empty vodka bottles make it no mystery why.
You had a vodka thief who you had to battle with the whole night and now you're tired?
I did finally see singin' in the rain last night. It was pretty good.
If by vodka thief you mean friend who I shared those bottles with and by battle whole night you mean play video games then yes.
Decisions decisions I could try sleeping more or I could try figuring out why some games run at half speed.
Its weird blazblue or king of fighters run like shit overwatch at 60fps.
Weird driver issue ?
Perhaps. just would like to figure out what driver suddenly broke.
Phew I love how I got more tired from walking home than spending an hour in the communal pool swimming v.
Time for my third shower today v.
Maybe save it untill its cooler ?
No I just reek of chlorine.
Also it's not that it's warm. It's just that first you need to shower to get into the pool and then you shower after that but you still reek of so much chlorine you're better of showering again at home.
MEH meh meh MEH.
Very important.
Don't forget to stop holding your cat.
Praise Satan's Spiritual Structure.
Pot is fine.
But not in a party.
Of course not.
Top comment + thread = D.
Thats... certainly a thing to do.
GlennCuttlefish SunTiger some being mad at Hanzo simulator?
Sorry didn't notice that until now. Was playing castlevania somethingoranother.
Question is Tingle otherkin.
No. Tingle is Tingle.
A man whose body is inhabited by the spirit of a reincarnated fairy.
Noelor I think Tingle is a category deserving itself.
Wait what.
They got a sniper rifle.
Yeah with a grenade.
That's a very easy green hill zone.
!hs healing wave.
Did the shaman win the joust then?
Just saw someone discover it in a video couldn't remember its mechanic.
Kingdom Hearts music fits with anything.webm.
That's Kingdom Hearts?
Not idk Jet Set?
No. That's Simple and Clean from KH1.
KH better music than I expected.
Or at least more interesting?
Thats the more upbeat version of it.
So Smurf apparently came out of Warcraft movie liking it. Not sure what to think of the world any more.
Smurf has terrible movie opnions.
I enjoyed it too >_>.
I just forgot to mention it after I saw it.
I enjoyed it.
Well forgot to mention it here I guess since I admitted as much to people on Skype.
I just didn't concurrently think it was good.
I found it enjoyable and okay. I mean not a 10/10 masterpiece but at least a solid movie.
So a 6/10 I guess.
Still going to see the sequel so vOv.
I kinda want to see a director's cut.
!hs explosive trap.
That didn't quite hit the mark.
Double-checking the trigger.
Didn't see that coming.
Friend updated his FB profile pic to one featuring his whole family him partner baby.
First comment said partner only took you nearly 4 years to include me in a profile picture.
Meanwhile Ironicus' latest podcast launched.
Him and his wife talking about history.
Pity the chicago video series never got finished.
This is the follow-up I guess.
Waiting until Watch_2_Dogs.
Still a better president story than Trump.
Watch_Degs 2 will be a while.
So I finally got around to watching the latest star wars movie.
I'm pretty sure the reason this villain wears that mask is that all the other kids made fun of him for looking like a huge nerd.
So how does it feel finally arrived in december 2015?
Well please I am getting enough aimless snark out of this movie as is.
GlennCuttlefish pretty accurate mask assessment afaik.
Asked for their thoughts on the arrest and sentencing the couple concluded that the experience as well as the financial loss was almost as bad as the movie.
Right thats that movie watched.
Action was okay sound design was good new cast was pretty meh one side character not included old cast was okay.
*Muffled house music in the background*.
SunTiger didd you get the Concordance stuff done?
Will write it afer this HS.
Sorry I left immediately after typing that.
Because my taxi was coincidentally only round the corner when I ordered it.
I'm still writing anyway.
How much info are you looking for ?
Just stuff I can spin off montage questions and a list of potential threat.
Meanwhile in corporate IT I asked if two databases were linked.
IT provided me with a hyperlink to one of them.
Well nothing broke which is nice.
Woke up around 7am to a huge thunder crash and then it was quiet...Too quiet.
My computer had shut down so I was kind of worried something had melted.
But no somehow this piece of shit survived.
<- this is the best thing I have seen today.
!note Noelor.
!note Kirisu.
!note Minister.
<- proclick.
Kirisu did you see my thingy on the tweeters ?
Not checked Twitter this morning.
I'm sure I'll lul subsequently.
It was just the writeup.
Company in the office below ours is closing their european offices.
There is a dick I used to work with who works there.
Anathema but your office isn't anywhere near closing down yet?
Not that I know of.
Guess y'all will just continue shouting at the Swiss people and trot along.
What did the swiss ever do to you.
MoonWolf lied for 2 years about the thing they were developing.
Were never making a cyberpunk game at all.
As much as I did like gwent not sure it will work as a stand alone game.
I'm assuming they'll flesh it out.
Last night in Overwatch someone said to me play Lucio mercy isn't competitive.
They... clearly have no clue what they are talking about.
Just for reference.
Right now most competitive teams for just generic team composition run a lucio AND a mercy.
Just both of the.
Ofcourse switches on or off to other compositions happen as maps and tactics and opponents dictate.
And for just regular old normal overwatch lucio is great on maps where you have to attack a point or move an objective.
Or defending a point.
Less so trying to stop a moving objective.
Mercy is great in defenses.
We were defending durado.
Yeah see thats fine.
And on the whole they are both Good Enough either way.
Right click Bastion -> enemy team disappears.
I just prefer lucio on offense because speed aura.
I don't use wallrunning enough.
Just don't try to solo support as symmetra.
I mean she's fine.
But she doesn't keep teams alive.
Zenyata also better with another support.
But you can do him solo if you are smart about it and have a decent team.
Cooked_Auto GlennCuttlefish Noelor.
Game tonight is cancelled.
Visiting my little brother in the hospital.
For those curious.
He has a serious kidney/upper urinal tract infection.
And is on like 2 kinds of antibiotics.
I'm sorry it took me a while to cancel it but it wasn't certain if he was coming back home tonight or not.
Only learned a while ago they want to keep him t here longer.
It's fine it's fine.
He went there last night so visit.
Meanwhile I'm doing dance research for Star Wars.
We are seriously doing a dance off next session in the campaign.
And we did Cold War heist hijinks last night.
Refrence to that dumb game ?
Well not quite We're in the middle of the Cold War in the Old Republic era between the Republic and Sith Empire and we had a mission to steal some artifacts from a gala.
So there was politicking going on at the same time as we tried to do our heist.
Let's just say it ended with the medical droid releasing hallucegenic gas into the place the gala was held. Earned him 2 dark side points. But we managed to complete the job.
Druids have side points ?
Yes in this case they do. For causing mass panic and probably at least a couple of accidents. All in the name of research.
Okay sure.
Time to see how this lentil masala turned out.
Too much water could be hotter and I'm not one for superhot curries.
This chicken halloumi salad turned out pretty good.
Seasoned it with sushi vinegar and mirin.
That does sound good.
Anyone for shootmans?
Have to decline today D.
This week's brawl is random hero.
Upon spawn and after every death.
They had that during the open beta week I think.
The other brawl in 10 mins is a deck full of random legendaries duplicating a pool of about 4 I think.
That link is kind of busted.
Enemy plays illidan in new brawl I pass twice cos I can't play a thing eventually slap down malkorok he starts threat spamming me...?
Cos I got a 2/4 hammer....?
Chat demands the yogg... I kinda wanna keep myself alive ... okay fine.
All must bow down to the demands of chat.
He ended up keeping himself alive vanishing the yogg while 'yogg and load'-ing as druid.
A lot of different classes cards.
All hail Yogg.
Even when it looks like Hanzo completely misses an arrow in say Hanamura. Someone in Dorado will get headshotted. It's kind of like gravity in a way.
So many of these brawl opponents are getting multiple draws of the 3-reduction card and I only see one starting one S.
Its a duplicate.
....legandary? What the hell brain.
GlennCuttlefish serves you right.
You and your legendaries.
Just got beaten by Yogg/Maly hunter.
Last night in Hero Quest the other two players died.
Rip your campaign.
The dungeon didn't have corridors when leaving a room you rolled 2 dice and teleported to a random one.
And you could not immediatly leave the one you entered.
The elf went into a room that had 4 enemies died immediatly he had some health missing.
Monsters can't open doors though right.
So I managed to find the quest objective and eventually make it back to the start but had to flee some rooms.
A smart dog can open doors but monsters can't ?
So those monsters kept trying to chase us but they kept ending up in the room the elf died in.
I got back to the entrance Dwarf eventually got shunted into the monster room and died.
Also one monster tele-fragged another D.
They both had useful artefacts though.
I have a stone of +2 mind literally does nothing.
That quest didn't even have any rewards.
We only have 4 more to go though.
I still haven't IRC'd from Bath.
But can do it from an airplane.
I thought you were doing e3 too ?
I\m staying on LA time so I can do E3 from home.
No point being there if you want to write news.
Get it all from streams easier coordinate with a team.
Maybe some value in going and oding it all from a nearby hotel but not the £££ it would cost.
Then again I was just flown 3000 miles for a 15 minute interview and to look at some nice statues and get drunk on someone else's dime so what do I know about value.
Did Noelor check his Twitter DMs yet.
Really 15 minutes ?
15 minutes with Chilton and Robinson art director.
20 PCs hooked up to the beta I have at home.
Bonus interview with James Waugh who does loads of creative direction for all Blizzard franchises.
So I interviewed Perculia and Red Shirt Guy and the dude behind FinalBoss.TV so I had more Value.
Lol you interviewed red shirt guy.
Perculia might be in the top 3 sharpest people I've ever spoken to.
He's really nice 3.
I basically said tell me what was wrong with the movie and then we went on about random BS for 20 minutes.
ChaosSmurf worth the trip time though ?
Well i had fun.
Spoke to loads of blizzard guys and INFLUENCERS.
Turns out all the WoW infuencers are solid as fuck.
Wow influencers sounds like the worlds dorkiest satanist cabal.
I'm not hip enough to have a clue what you mean by INFLUENCERS.
You pretty much have it right.
Youtubers and streamers.
They influence opinion.
But aren't journalists so can be bribed.
Is CONTENT CREATORS too old now ?
Too broad I think.
Everyones a content creator.
People actually listen to influencers.
Reynad and kibler were there but I didn't speak to them.
I did talk to Leeroy Jenkins for like half an hour.
Boy is he ever dead behind the eyes.
Look at this dog though.
ChaosSmurf basically done with his meme status ?
I think he likes the opportunities but its all too aware for what he is.
I was going to interview him about it but it made me sad to think about.
That is a good article C_A it answers my most burning question in the opening paraphrase.
It's nice to see an animal at CERN that's both alive and not shutting down billion dollar experiments.
<- I wish that happened would be less of a pain to deal with.
MoonWolf apparently Celestalon doesnt seep.
Well I hope not.
Thats not healthy.
He said he meditates.
I know one of those mutants as well guy sleeps less than 4 hours every day.
I wanted to call BS but I wasn't really in the conversation at the time.
Airek was like that.
It makes me so mad.
I wish I didn't have to sleep.
Just think of all the things I would not get done even then.
But at least I would be awake for that.
But then again I would have to stop drinking alcohol.
Yeah tradeoffs are severe.
I am considering going to srict 6 hours.
Well good luck with that you will be feeling like shit all day every day.
ChaosSmurf someone else paid for you to go to Blizzard for a 15 minute interview?
And also the WoW premiere.
You made it.
About which I am going to write zilcho.
Jamie Lee Curtis was nice.
Jessica Nigri was there in her Deathwing cosplay and I was too close to that for comfort.
Oh no exposed midriff.
That shit is a lot more than midriff.
I spoke to thise dude cosplaying Varian though he was nice.
I love skating up from pits as lucio.
Typical summer day.
Had to put on a darn extra jumper today -.
Last week was the damn hot week.
Could barely sleep.
So this is much nicer.
Anathema ha ha.
Is Ana around?
I have a web tool to describe to you.
There is a service called BACS which processes bulk payments within the UK.
And the governing body updated their encryption requirements this year so we've been installing upgraded software for the upload of BACS files from our databases.
In one case the upload software is used via Internet Explorer.
When you ask it to import a BACS for grim the database it presents the vital stats in a sort of in-window popup.
That's probably the wrong name but anyway.
This window-in-a-window has a fixed resolution so all the information is present.
It does not have scrollbars.
Laptop users cannot import or send the files.
Because on a laptop screen's resolution they cannot see the buttons in the pop-up.
Kirisu they might be able to trick it into scrolling by selecting text of fof the screen.
No the page never responds to tab.
When enturing login.
Details you have to click from name to password.
Pressing tab just takes you out of input completely.
Are the buttons and stuff inside it normal browser controls?
Well do they look the same?
No action results in the address in my address bar changing.
Some things look like hyperlinks but just open up those in-window pop-up whatevers.
Oh the other thing about the pop-ups is they have two buttons OK and Cancel.
Cancel doesn't take you back.
It deletes the file.
So if you open one by mistake tough shit.
It's either getting paid or gone forever.
The fucking best.
I forgot something about the software.
So it's hosted online and accessed by IE8.
Let me repeat.
Every time we go to the url.
A kitten dies.
It advises us that it doesn't have a recognized security certificate.
Okay that one is NOT OKAY AT ALL.
A UK national level bank level service has NO EXCUSE to not have a properly signed cert.
Nah it'll be hosted by Minister's company.
And they just have their own certificate they signed but haven't put the root in the trusted list via GP for some reason.
Https// then a server name that is probably a really long acronym.
Www doesn't mean anything special.
Also MoonWolf this software isn't provided by the banks.
Its just a regular subdomain.
They just dictate the protocol.
That this particular instance is configured to.
Minister thats less terrible then.
But sill a little terrible.
Eh it's still encrypted just means when its MITM'd no-one will notice.
Anathema its major financial transactions.
Fucking things should be able to sort out their certs.
MoonWolf you'd think.
But then you'd also probably expect our isp to be in this country.
Depending on the day my isp is quite often in the Netherlands.
We get .nl stuff by default on things.
I mean at least its closeby.
But its still unusual.
Wait what.
I got it. I'll shoot shoot and shoot. So that's where that line is from. Goddamn it Dingo.
Dingo has the worst lines.
To get mad about videogames or install fanservice ninjas.
That one also sounds like getting mad about videogames.
They're comrades now Cooked_Auto.
But my pals!
But I like fanservice.
Why would that make me mad.
Because a game thats mostly fanservice is actually a terrible game.
Perhaps but its not going to make me as mad.
Because I will be distracted by fanservice.
Gods that Merrah fusion is so fuckin' rad.
My new hoody arrived.
Hmm yes definitely new hoody weather.
Otoh I bought a magnum on the way home.
Any level of actual details yet?
No blizzard like keeping it vague as always.
Well that was strange.
AAH! TINY IMP CHILD!
Snek Dad!
Of course.
We needed this.
!note MairBear.
That's odd I thought these cheese onion crisps don't say they're suitable for vegetarians.
So I looked at the ingredients.
Flesh of the unpure.
Yep yep good sign right there.
And TIL about.
Cheese not always vegetarian friendly.
Though now I'm like can I ever trust cheese again?
Oh you didn't know about rennet.
No no you can't.
Probably not. Hardbread and water all day long.
There are non animal sources for rennet substites.
Noelor is busy prepping for the Awakening where everything will be soy and krill unless you're loaded. Its a Shadowrun joke fyi.
The realproblem is that i don't think cheese producers really care to disclose it ?
Even the coffee is soy. Enjoy that.
On account of it's one of those things people would be disgusted by.
Even if they weren't veggy.
I'm eating stuff from cow stomaches? Brutal..
Here have this cheese. We killed a baby cow and cut up its.
...stomach so we could make it partially digest some milk.
That's what this is.
Now I dont know about you but this information still loses to the fact that cheese is delicious.
This is basically why most people aren't vegetarians.
Meat tastes good.
And its a great source of protein.
And forget how they turn cows into steaks.
I don't... forget that ?
Cows are delicous.
Well the meaty bits.
Fur isn't so great.
Sorry when I say forget.
Not people literally don't remember.
You mean don't actually care.
People choose to set that knowledge aside.
I mean cows are pretty goddamn adorable. If vat grown meat was a proper option I might go for that.
My mothers side of the family was farmers milk and my fathers side of the family owned greenhouses.
I'm not going to claim this makes me bullshit closer to nature or whatever.
But cows are meat we slaughtered this cow and its in the freezer now.
Is a literal thing that has happened to me more than once.
GlennCuttlefish probably in our lifetime.
The real problem right now is economy of scale.
Cows are way to cheap still.
Which is weird becaause honestly they are not.
Another problem is that vat meat is still just soppy gunk there is no tone to it.
They've worked that out.
Its just expensive to excersize it.
Have they? Must have missed the news.
GlennCuttlefish well they didn't fix it for vat grown meat itself.
They fixed it for muscle and heart implants/grafts.
Which still isn't 100% there.
But being worked on really hard.
Hearts being luckily for humanity.
I mean they are complex arrangements of muscles.
But thats it.
You try making a kidney instead.
Well that was a round in overwatch.
My team was just that bad.
2 symmetras no tank or support on offense.
2 offensive symmetras.
It's okay we'll switch to soy soon.
Just gotta get used to the taste of soycaff.
And just dont be too worried when people around you suddenly go through goblinization.
Soy is vile.
I'll start the meat rebellion before that happens.
I will literally eat vegans if I have to.
Well its either Soy or Krill.
I am seriously starting to suspect overwatch is giving me headaches.
How the fuck do I get objective time gold when I am mostly flanking their sniper as diva?
How are peope this bad in videogames.
Because they are people.
And people are terrible.
How the fuck was I supposed to win that.
Half our team was just sitting on their asses in our spawn for the first 2 points.
<- I don't even want to know do I?
Noelor its a monkey.
Do the math.
I'd forgotten that.
Good i suppose.
No. It just started hailing outside.
All of a sudden.
And now it sounds like thunder is rolling in too.
Haha I was in Game earlier. PC aisle has Overwatch in #1 bestseller. One of the OW cases had a Battleborn case sitting in front of it.
I think that tumbler design just gave me a hernia.
Myeah that first one is dire.
>adds Polite drug dealer to the list of possible TTRPG characters.
Speaking of London.
Hey perfect stuff for OTS.
I have internet again.
Great googly moogly.
Did you work out the thing yet.
Yeah for some reason IRC wouldn't let me connect for an hour before. And then I randomly fixed by ticking a checkbox v.
I think ChaosSmurf ment his house has internet again now.
I DM'd you back.
So you did.
It's about the differences between her and her dragon form.
Hair buns = horns?
Ok I actually need to find pix then.
It's actually more obvious in their names.
Oh do you just mean that she has time in her name?
Ok so the only pic of her I can find in dragon form it's generic dragon model.
Also playing game rn.
SO her dragon name is Chronormu.
Other bronze dragons are also called -mu.
But the female ones are called -i Nozari and Soridormi according to WoW-Wiki.
And also Chromie.
That is stupendously niche and nerdy.
But also supercute.
Celestalon pointed it out.
And I was like that is very cool.
Supports hands-free voice controls when microphone is enabled.
Now that is some proper priorities.
Wait whats this about chromie between the male/female bronze flight suffixes?
Someone started up some discussion that Chromie's name is male while she looks female or something. I mean she did even mention it in HotS.
Chromie may be trans*.
But then again chromie is a dragon and shapeshifting is very lovely at letting you be whatever you want.
Noelor i'm not sure thats supposed to mean that.
MoonWolf not the HotS thing.
The character design in warcraft looks...familiar...
Great. head ache again.
Dick Warlock sfw somehwo.
Huh. so thats how it feels like to be on the steamrolling team for once.
>volskaya attack 2 widowmaker 1 symmetra.
Wrb ability to change skins pre-game.
But...you can do that pre and post game? Just not in game. Which is a good thing.
I think my computer would melt if some people teamed up and just started switching skins in the waiting room.
But I have to leave a game to change skins then.
Cryouts of we need a healer. Solo support symmetra swaps to hans.
Honestly symmetra needs to be moved to the defense category and labeled as a builder.
Thats what she does.
I love her she's a great character to play.
She's not a support.
She's a bit like Tassadar in HotS.
Oh you picked the one who can only shield dmg can only regen the dmg with a reactive leech talent yeh we don't need a healer!
I mean honestly they need to just remove the shield ability.
Apparantly it was too good at 50.
Esp when said talent is on a tier with other competitive choices map/opposition dependent.
But right now its just boring and doenst do all that much.
Yay got the dva cheevo for blocking damage.
What was your APM then?
Would you say it was Raised ?
Is Mair around.
No his pipe is broken.
Rip mairs pipe.
He's probably in bed.
I thought I was on Mairtime.
Mairtime is far more fluid than simply changing timezone.
Are you doing Legion Noelor.
No plans atm.
Depending on when it is.
I'm going back for pre-patch but debating rolling US with some of the folks I met last week.
ChaosSmurf i look forward to that expansion having two endgame raids and then 2 years of no wow.
It'll be great.
MoonWolf they confirmed 3 tiers of raids this week.
And new dungeons in every patch.
All 2 patches.
Confirmed 3+ patches too.
Plus scaling stuff makes it far harder to run out of content now.
It's basically like running out of content in Diablo.
Only the world is 3-4 times as big.
I'm sure they'll fuck it up in new and exciting ways.
But first month should be even better than last time which is all I really want.
I probably need to not be playing WoW in September tbh.
What's happening in September.
Sounds like EXACTLY when to go back to WoW to me.
Anyway I will see what Mair is doing.
Is Glenn still pretending he won't come back.
He is my anakin skywalker.
Who are you in this analogy.
Grand moff tarkin?
The ginger fella from the new one?
Anyone want to Overwatch?
Dinner soon afterwards yes.
Gods not only is this warrior managing to achieve the play fiery war axe perfectly on curve he has 2 in hand to choose from t1.
BwaS warriros are fun that way.
Do you like to play with fire? the wild pyro asked flamewreathed faceless.
I appreciate a recipe that's simple to follow.
1 or 8.
Doesn't work for 5 or 2.
Not sure this can be called murloc paladin if they've played only 2 of the 3/2/1-charge murlocs by T10 S.
Murloc paladin only plays the charge and buff murlocs.
It plays all of them out then play anyfin.
They know EXACTLY what anyfin gets them.
And thats a board full of high damage charge.
Murlocs are the win condition not the deck.
Ketting sick of losing Overwatch games because I'm the only person who tries to stop the objective moving.
Or capture the point.
As a support...
OTOH I made probably my best ever spaghetti bolognese last night.
Ok now I've had foot I can Overwatch again.
I'll foot you |.
I don't get the internet.
Frodan's hair melding with the studio lighting to give the illusion he's bald.
MairBear are you playing Legion.
Lets face it.
I was considering rerolling on US.
But it is a massive pain in the ass and means I don't get to keep my YEARS OF TRANSMOG.
Well if you want to do raids and stuff... you might want to do that if you have people.
I'd rather be able to play with people here + find a decent guild if need be.
Way to ruin it ana.
Oh dear goodness what.
MoonWolf blackrock mountain won't be rotated out till spring right?
Yes rotations happen on the first release of the year.
So probably around spring next year blackrock and tournament are going away.
Jfc why are people so bad at this we need to escort a thing lets all play widowmaker and junkrat and then wonder why we lost.
Well after friends birthday party where punch was flowing and at one point had at least 3 different liquors in it time to do the reasonable thing today.
And go to the zoo.
Anathema junkrat is great for zoning out corners though.
We had no tanks.
This brawl is fun with friends.
I have about 15 malornes in my deck at this point.
>quintuple kill with self-destruct clearing the objective of enemies.
Urgh my gpu isn't new enough to do the xbox recording stuff either.
Omg that cardboard d.va.
It's turn 20 something.
I have 31 cards in deck.
Noooo we reached turn limit c.
There's a turn limit? o.0.
89 turns and then you both concede.
The game ends after the player who took the first turn gets to turn 90.
I'm not sure why that number instead of 100.
But at this point 30 cards have been drawn at least from both decks and 30 ticks of fatigue damage would have been incurred if the decks were empty.
Which is a good indicator that the game is likely at a stalemate.
Wether thats because of endlessly cycling between decks and hand/board cards or self healing that can't be beaten by damage or whatever.
Or two players just intentionally streching the game out.
In which case they probably won't mind the game ending to start with.
Hell wouldn't you be at fatigue 50?
A lot of fatigue in any case.
HAH we play a for-realsies match he has yogg ysharj cthun onyxia and dragonlord deathwing in hand.
Yogg... humilities himself. And astral communions that hand.
Noelor at turn 50 assuming you ran out of cards on 30 player one would be taking 20 damage.
But assuming typical decks you'd run out much earlier than that.
Because you start the game on turn 1 having drawn 4 cards of your deck.
And it assumes you draw 1 card from your deck every turn after that.
Both of which. don't hold.
I see you Vectron.
Damn it Wanda.
Finally doing the brawl.
I got Reno in my deck =V.
Which means you have 4 renos in your deck total.
Which isn't great.
And none of them do the thing.
Yeah some real trash ones in it.
Like the valkyr twins.
I got to become Ragnaros in one of my games that was fun.
And not a moment TOO SOON.
That one.
MoonWolf ^ I don't even.
Looks like they still haven't nerfed/prevented use of the Waterstrider.
It's some random MoP thing that you could use in WoD to mount in water.
And it was super useful.
And half of this zone in Legion I'm looking at is also water.
There's WoD progression that can yield one.
Is it soloable?
I was gonna get one in pre-patch.
Did that seahorse from Cata ever work anywhere else?
Is it just a fishing thing then?
What Cooked_Auto said.
The questline one in vashjir doesn't.
A rare in the zone drops a global version.
I'll have to go find it then.
Ok yeh there's one for repping up with the MoP 'fishing' faction second exchanged with Nat Pagle with coins for fishing up rares in Draenor.
I think they may have said at some point they were thinking of taking out water striders in leg then ppl got upset and they went back?
MoonWolf ^ I don't even <- all three are epics!
Literally the only thing the game cares about for arena choices.
ChaosSmurf obviously this is DEMON WATER.
And you can't just use a regular old normal water waterstrider.
Well I wish that was true.
They should take them out they're massively useful and impossible for new players to get in a reasonable time frame.
It's not like it's the only source of waterwalking.
It's the only globally accessible one isn't it.
There are... 4 classes with some level of waterwalking i think.
Deathknights on mounts rogues on sprint shamans priests.
Druids get seal form but thats not exactly on water.
Very useful though.
Locks I think.
Not aware of that.
Not exactly an avid wow player anymore.
Was a glyph at least last time I played lock.
Obviously only warlock water walking should work in this expansion.
The rest will need to learn DEMON WATER WALKING.
I'm okay with it.
So when you coming back MW eh eh.
Hah good joke.
It might work in an expansion or 2.
How long was the gap before WoD.
Didn't play Cata or Pandas.
There is actually some demon water here that he can't walk on.
Forgot it was sunday.
Now I have no food.
Hunters have a BM exotic strider pet that grants water walking.
So what this actually is.
Is just this motherfucker.
On lame-ass warrior.
On non-fishing non-alchemy warrior.
I legitimately have no understanding of how people can be bothered with the minor professions.
Arch drops some goodies like that crazy troll sword.
Which I got before I stopped playing v.
But this was before heirlooms were account wide so it was kind of stuck on my Rogue.
You can have it on all of them now.
Yeah that happened after I stopped.
Its pretty oglaf.
Blurgh I think I didn't breakfast correctly almost threw up three times on my run once since I got back.
Eh okay I guess.
Tavern brawl. opponent drops a blingtron.
I receive Gorehowl. he gets cursed blade.
14 damage to face.
Well I kinda took the 'use the gorehowl long game to keep board control' route.
I want actual nurse skin.
Torbjöats. Snrk.
So I've got double lorewalker cho down. me and this shaman who has lethal have now spent about 2 turns each exponentially spawning the 0 mana 3-less legendary play card.
He ended up playing 2 yoggs in a single turn that did an absolute tonne.
Opponent this round thaurrisan. Me reno S.
So EA messed up.
Good job ea.
Stop doing that.
I've walked around 5-6km today on my totally fine leg.
Around the same on my less fine leg.
I did see some elk.
And a peacock came within arms reach since they walk around freely on the zoo island.
As did a goose that for once was not angry as hell.
Seems like a reoccuring thing.
SHEN’S LAST GIFT introduces ADVENT’s “Lost Towers” facility where Chief Engineer Lily Shen accompanies your squad in search of her late father’s secretive final project. Discover a unique new soldier class complete with powerful new combat abilities strategy mechanics and customization options.
Leak or reveal?
Any date btw?
From here.
Unsure if this is supposed to be up.
Or up early by accident.
MoonWolf you are a butt >.
Duh Overwatch p.
But your team did get owned.
You didn't even get a single card on that match.
Yeah but if you'd joined the group you wouldn't have swapped teams and we'd probably of won p.
I'm just mad all my loot boxes were trach.
English is hard.
My fingers just don't do what I want them to do its the same problem I have trying to play guitar.
I did not know you the player actually played Crash Bandicoot in Uncharted.
The new XBone a 40% smaller VCR.
Xbox 1... s.
We really needed the xbone to have higher performance.
Now it'sreally XBONES.
MoonWolf better performance is one of the key things the PS4 has over XBone afaik.
And better library.
But if you have the same game on both it'll be better on PS.
So if you're just into AAA stuff that comes out on both...
This is actually sort of good.
In other news EA cannot into conference.
Oh boy big news from EA.
Big news from EA.
They are releasing a new one of all those games they release a new one of every 1 to 2 years.
There is nothing 1 to 2 years about it.
Still uncertain about mass effect andromeda.
The problem with andromeda.
It's doing to be DAI in space pretty much.
Is that what i really want from mass effect.
Is more of the stuff i know a little bit about.
Not to go somewhere completly new where i know nothing.
Personally I'd just rather forget about old mass effect after 3.
Fuck I just remembered kai leng again.
Fuck everything about 3.
Aside from the side missions I'd rather forget 2 and onwards.
Oh boy more FIFA.
Now with more FROSTBITE.
Like EVERY EA GAME.
Hey the engine is good really.
And sooner or later the UT and Quake engine is going to be replaced.
What uses quake now.
Other than UT4.
..is UT4 even a thing.
Unreal Engine 4 is a thing yes.
Yes but as in unreal 4.
Oh boy FIFA has story mode.
Just what I wanted.
Just what i wanted in my life.
No but there is that stand alone Unreal.
Oh and they got Peter Cullen to voice one of the TItans in Titanfall 2 apparently. So yesh. Titanfall is pretty much a transformers game now.
Oh gods FIFA just wont stop.
Who presumably exist.
Because they keep making the damn things.
And they're half of youtube it seems like sometimes.
Yet another artsy puzzle sidescroller.
It wasn't even a sidescroller I think.
Yeah I rescind the sidescrolling part at least.
Of course they didn't show ANYTHING.
Well they did show one thing that caught my eye.
A ship cockpit with VR.
Anyone for OW?
Sort of OW'd out for the day.
Maybe after the EA conference.
Its been going for a while.
Dunno when it ends.
I'll probs just go to bed then.
Oh I think its ending.
You can actually play a game now.
Still up for it noelor or will I do solo games until I win one?
Solos it is I guess.
I was watching that thing MoonWolf linked.
A story mode for fifa - is this something other than choose Daggenham and Redbridge and try and take them to the Fifa Club World Cup final over 5 consecutive seasons?
Real talk MairBear should I uninstall overwatch? I suspect its bringing out my inner asshole and that is something I would prefer to keep under wraps.
Oh I stopped playing a while back.
I don't think you'd need to uninstall it no.
Pan out to reveal 5x genji or something.
Or a bit of protagonist was themselves a genji overextending halfway across the map into a 1v5.
Sigh my right computer has started to pop randomly and the last thing I want to do is to buy a whole new speaker set. Great.
Skyrim remaster finally looks as good as modders made skyrim look 6 months later.
I hadn't checked twitter all weeken.
So this morning's scroll-through sure was fun!
Not actually fun.
Why even bother.
Its e3 and shootings.
Just skip it.
I get no E3.
But there's no easy hashtag to mute for shootings.
And whatever way my brain is broken prevents just skipping to top.
Talking of shooting.
GlennCuttlefish you and I express/process anger very differently but I don't think I'd play a game that made me as angry as OW seems to make you as much as you do sorry for phrasing english is a butt.
Everythign is awful just end the human race.
Unsure if talking about shootings or e3.
Wait what a skyrim hr remake?
Could be both really.
Anathema not even remake.
Just better graphics and textures.
You get it for free on pc if you own skyrim already.
They are doing it for the sales on the new gen of consoles.
Yay more skyrim.
Ok wow it looks significantly better with the new lighting stuff.
Shame my GPU can't do godrays.
Get a new one.
I may have to.
And I actually complete the main storyline for oce.
I still haven't completed the skyrim storyline.
Is ESO dead?
Anathema I've heard some people play it.
But haven't seen recent player figures.
Oh apparatly not.
Anathema you could ask a colleague of yours who also plays OW maybe he still logs in from time to time.
First weapon gets drawn turn 3.
It'll be great.
I did win.
Turn after I played the reaper got an upgrade.
To go with the two pirate ladies waiting in my hand since mulligan.
I do like that deck a lot.
It's a lot of fun.
And probably the most consistent aggro deck in my current stable.
I'm missing cards for the others I think.
Let's just ignore that a Swiss lady probably has at least a smattering of french.
Don't overthink it.
I just said I was ignoring it!
Overwatch needs a Welsh character.
Noelor When Mei ults ingame she says Dong4 Zhu4 Bu4 Xu2 Zou3 This sounds a lot like Dong4 Zuo4 Bu4 Xi2 Zao3 动作不洗澡 which literally translated is 'Action Don't Shower'.
No clue if true at all funny if it is.
If those sound alike it's down to accent.
But I'd believe it.
I've started playing Endless Legend.
Broken Lords have brilliant hero units.
Enjoy your lack of a day.
Huh Chris Avellone is work on Prey 2. That's rad.
095105 › anathema is ESO dead? - Dark Brotherhood expansion came out recently so technically not.
Forces better be in that shit.
One can only hope.
If not you'll have to play it constantly in the background.
Noelor I should play Endless Legend again maybe I'll join you one day when we're both too salty and mad at shootybang.
Let me tell you a surprising tale about salt.
So there I was.
On ilos again.
Angry about snipers.
And we actually won.
No salt was found that round.
Well widowmaker is bullshit.
Legitimate salt there.
They are in fact nerfing widowmaker in some fashion.
Widowmaker is bullshit and hanzo is bullshit both for totally different reasons.
Hanzo just needs his fucking arrow to not have worlds largest hitbox.
I don't mind hanzo at least if you get close to him you can kill him.
Earlier on we had a round we lost because our reinhardt got upset that I told him to leave stragglers who are reunning away to me since I was winston.
And he switched to mei.
WM just zips away or kills you with her SMG.
And we lost.
Anathema then he presses e and shoots the floor anywhere near you and bam 3 arrows.
Nah widowmaker is bigger bullshit.
I hate widowmaker more than mcree.
Her fully charged bodyshot does what 150 damage?
And takes less than a second to charge.
Yeah mccree is annoying widowmaker is the worst though.
Exactly 1 second I thought o.
Yesterday i totally almost won a match by switching to reihart into a team that was 3 or 4 soldiers.
4 soldiers a reinhart and a mercy i think.
Nah mccree is legit broken as well but for the reason that his damage output is enough to melt tanks.
God that was a pain to play against.
Sounds good moonwolf.
Widowmaker = if you are at all able to shoot you can change a match. If you are a good sniper you can dominate it.
GlennCuttlefish not really i had to switch out of support to do it.
Good widowmaker alone forces your opposing team to switch their tactics.
McCree you can make that one guy really really angry at you but still get shut down.
But it helped more than trying to heal random idiots as they got shit by soldiers ultiying.
MoonWolf with that many healing grenades behind your shield who needs it.
The enemy team was soldiers.
We were a random assortment of stuff.
Mccree is broken yeah but way less aggravating than you stepped outside the spawn and died from halfway across the map.
Just a reinhardt and 4 soldires behind his shield.
Marching over the map.
Today we had a defending team all reinhardt in kings row.
Maybe one lucio in there might have imagined that.
Also the 90% uptime on wallhack.
GlennCuttlefish time for explosives!
Easiest point ever for us.
Explosives haha no.
All it took.
I prefer explosives to bastion.
Out of principle.
Explosives take too long.
Also too risky bastion just murders a charging rein.
Hm no point mowing the lawn today. Been so warn and so little rain barely anything has grown.
Also this set in general.
Shitty Belcher omg.
Budget Varian on rafaam beauty.
MoonWolf okay I lost it at Blood Manos.
ALL THE MINIONS.
My dad has come round today.
So I got my paperback copy of Fellowship \o/.
NEW WATER.
Yay new water.
Better than the old water.
Meet the new water same as the old one.
To be fair diva's damage is pretty much just throwing doritoes.
Its true.
Nasty up-close but the massive drop-off and inability to move and shoot are a bad combo.
People just walk backwards and suddenly they take no damage.
Only time I've felt threatened lately against a diva was as winston.
And even then I chose to go in for the kill.
Practice vs AI is literally pointless...
Doing Nepal we killed the AI.
So our bastion camps their spawn.
Yes yes it is.
.only good for very basic aim practise.
Its good to find out how to even overwatch.
Things I fail to understand in drawing How to draw the lower half of a cartoon rabbits head.
Something always seems off just trying to figure out what.
Well rabbits don't have face tentacles for once.
If only I could draw face tentacles properly.
I'd draw cuttlefish all day.
Build a brand out of it.
Start my own genetic engineering laboratory.
And finally I would take over the world with my army of super cephalopods.
Alas for now I'll just doodle badly drawn cartoon rabbis.
Probably not rabbis.
GlennCuttlefish pls draw one doodle of a rabbi-rabbit.
I tried mai...Goddamnit mair.
I did make a quick noodle of a rabbi-t.
But somehow it turned into some kind of badly drawn gangster along the way.
Jesus christ overwatch.
So kings row.
We lose the first point.
My team that the best course of action now is to camp THE LAST POINT.
We are on defense.
Just cede the rest of the map.
Now I suddenly want to paint all my future AoS Elves as Winter elves under the service of the Raven Queen.
Man that ff xv demo was terrible.
Who ever was playing it was awful.
Why isn't that game out yet.
They had their playable demo over a year ago.
Maybe they still haven't finished recording lines and polishing everything else.
Or even finished all the maps.
They're busy trying to work out how to make Cidney more fanservice.
Just make her naked then.
Lol John Carmack is just on stage.
With an OR Minecraft presentation.
Oh god someone turned on carmack and now he won't turn off.
No they managed to find the off switch.
So it was just minecraft?
But now with console mods?
And we're entering quirky indie phase.
Hey something good comes out of it at times.
Like Ori last year.
Cuphead still never going to be released.
Yeah out of a thousand games they say are in development I imagine only 10% of those will come out.
I have no fucking clue what's going on.
Nevermind it's pretty much Brazil the game.
LISA 3d confirmed.
Oh no oh no.
Oh no no no noo.
For GWENT GlennCuttlefish.
YOU CANT MAKE ME.
For GWENT totes.
I wonder if they will be able to balance that.
I mean gwent is fine and all.
BUT WHERE IS MY CYBERPUNK.
In the grim dark cyberpunk future.
There is only gwent.
Street Fighter vs Tekken it seems.
Just tekken 7.
Harada styling all over this conference.
OH SWEET JESUS HARADA.
Yeah show em hands.
I dont want to see the video anyway.
Just zoom out.
All the way to vegas.
Zoom out more pls.
Okay this seems neat unlike the previous one.
Motherfucking Kamiya-san is on stage.
Yeah but >scalebound.
Time for action in silky smooth 14FPS.
Looks more like 20FPS to me.
Hype levels falling.
Bet he's got a set of beats headphones.
Guess this will be the first platinum game I have absolutely no interest in.
Its just so slow.
WILL YOU STOP ZOOMING OUT GODDAMNIT WHO TRAINED THIS CREW.
Oh god these guys are INSUFFERABLE.
But.. they're having the time of their pirate life!
Yeah but no one fucking talks like that ever while gaming.
If there is more treasure hunting in that than the trailer let on I might be interested.
Please no not more zombies.
I was just about to say.
Neat trailer but meh.
Halo anything just doesn't do it for me.
Halo wars 2? DId the first one really do well enough?
But it was console only and this is multiplat.
That's your next PC Halo release then.
You wanted one of those right?
Another Halo game on PC?
This is what you meant?
But hey since blizzard failed with SC2 maybe the koreans will be happy.
They just want SC1 again.
Microsoft announcing xbones woo.
Fully uncompressed pixels oo.
Shut up todd nobody believes your lies.
Why did I click on facebook.
What part of me considered that a good idea.
Project Hank Scorpio.
I dont know.
Everything I learned in this conference is that I should not buy an xbone.
And Win10 is still not worth it.
Meanwhile MS want's to support three different consoles.
Meanwhile the PC gaming show is turning into the joke of the year I'm hearing.
So same as last year.
On the one hand they have an astartes on stage. on the other hand it's a thousand s-... 'blood raven'.
At the same time its the most awkward Marine I've ever seen.
He looks weird mostly because he's a true scale marine.
Compare it then to this guys armor.
Who even is this.
If only day9 went didnt you guys go bust? what happened to dmo?
Pc I hear.
For some reason none of the streams work.
This is further verifying why I will never play Ark.
It's good to know america is solving their gun problem by giving game devs rainbow pin badges to wear.
Well yeah the game has some terrible dinosaur models in it.
GTX 480 confirmed for $200 also cheaper cards.
Whatever atis card was.
Also VR serious sam.
Which may or may not happen since its apparently a side project.
And their main focus is on Sam 4.
Noelor you're a masochist.
As I'm currently playing Ex2.
Are you your new character yet ?
Just rolled 6suxx on 5 dice though!
To... understand an idiom.
Boo yay boo.
Noelor how very Noelor of you.
Fair and balanced HS card.
I mean... sort of?
Technically this is completly fair.
Its also broken as fuck.
A card minions budget is manacost +2 +1 +1 for a class card.
So an 8 mana minion hunter minion has 10 points of budget.
Health and attack cost 1 budget.
Giving it directly to another minion like that is 1 for 1 on budget cost.
Oh my god Ubi has gotten the most finnish guy ever on stage now.
Cooked_Auto he's drinking on stage ?
No but his accent is fantasticly thick and finnish.
Wait was that guy finnish.
MoonWolf but you need a minion on field to use it.
I mean at 8 it's at least possible to combo it without Emperor/Coin/whatever antics.
I like this one for its symmetry.
Sure is priest.
Oh gods this must become a reality before I die.
Pro overwatch click amazing pixel spray animation.
Oh shit.
Well Ubisoft wins best of show far with their presentation.
Dofus movie has finally been subbed.
Writing specialty ideas for my Kujo Jotaro-inspired alchemical.
Foobar shuffles to Yes.
To be continued?
2250 pro overwatch click amazing pixel spray animation.
So? I happened to miss that. So what?
1.25 hours 10 lines including PatternSpider.
And he described it.
I was busy watching E3 streams |.
For the past... oh couple of hours.
GlennCuttlefish and somehow I'm certain there's a french pun there.
This is certainly a french animation.
VR resident evil.
Also new kojima project.
The trailer summarized.
For the actual trailer.
Also MairBear I tried doing the rabbit rabbi but somehow it ended up as some kind of gangster.
No I did not spend more than a couple of minutes working ont it.
With the way the trailer started I'm kind of disappointed the game was not called Hideo Kojima's Crabocalypse.
And since the sun has been up for a couple of hours now I think I'll go do bed. Good night.
Dragon priests pretty good on the ladder right now.
At least this morning.
It was bad earlier c.
3 wins to 6 losses.
With dragon priest ?
I did 1 win 1 loss 4 wins.
Though a few situations of if i had that card.
Seemed okay to me!
I didn't even get to alexstraza anyone because they were all below 15 by the time i got to 9 mana.
I think I need to read Dr Doom stories.
Dr Boom > Dr Doom.
Doom will consider your request.
!note Noelor readers of EGS keep shiping the wrong triad.
Since i have it now if anyone was wondering what the dog we have around now looks like.
<- nigel.
First time I've seen a picture load sideways v.
Yeah anathema said that too in another channel.
Not sure what that happens.
Could be the resolution since its 2988x5312 pixels.
Because it displayed as incredibly stretched before snapping down.
So for a second I thought it was a dachshund.
MoonWolf was the picture taken with a phone?
Didn't take it myself.
Well I'm guessing the jpg was encoded from left->right because that's how the sensors / memory in the phone are arranged and there is an orientation flag in the metadata.
I do hate it when the enemy knows the hard counter to mercy C Kill her.
People who beeline for supports are literally satan.
People who prioritize support are a credit to the team.
So satan is a credit to the team.
I'm not happy about it either.
You dont have to be.
Join a game 1 widomaker 4 offense...
Time to practise genji.
Widow swapped to tracer.
Practising genji all day.
Play of the game enemy tracer slaps a sticky onto our team in first second of it. Spends the rest of the PotG chasing mercy. No one turns around. No one.
And this is why i prefer lucio.
Because lucio can RUN THE FUCK AWAY.
Oh play of the game.
Enemy widowmaker chasing our unmeka'd D.va with her cross hair for 3 seconds one shot sure. And then two headshots immediately after.
But the time it took to kill the dva.
Game ending slow-down I do my usual emote cos why not.
Even in the slow down the enemy mccree had to rmb me.
I was mei.
Well thats the dofus movie finished.
If you enjoyed wakfu or dofus at all see it.
Well okay its an Obsidian RPG v.
Also that after credits scene makes me repeat myself Sure is a french animation.
Can't be that extensive if he tased himself by accident.
Still the best pun.
The medicine is damage boosted rockets.
I used to have a cold but now that i'm a diffuse cloud of blood and small bone fragments my cold is gone!
Man the legal definition of butt is a mouthful.
My latest scrape of the /owg/ thread had so much PharMercy it was great 3c.
!note Noelor.
MairBear so you know how D.va mech dropping in does a bit of damage around you ?
Turns out Genji can PARRY THAT SHIT.
He can parry anything.
You can parry Mei's ultimate.
GlennCuttlefish that mccree nerf is pretty seirous.
MoonWolf it isn't really.
Still gibs say winston if it hits.
Ducks sake 3 priests in a row on wild ladder.
And of course the third wanker is running a reno deck with golden portrait.
Priest in a fucking nutshell I'm shit at this game can't build a deck and have no cards hey you build my deck for me k thx.
Its so terrible i love it.
A totally original game.
Original widowmaker do not steal.
Also that framerate.
Not sure if the music is the correct one or not because that's obviously just E.S. Posthumus.
In before it has better tickrate.
MairBear and it won't matter at that framerate.
Gotta offset the atrocious performance somehow.
Oh my god.
Do you think the 'titan' is intentional or just standard video game vague naming scheme.
They are not trying to sell original game do not steal.
They are trying to cash in on blizzards game.
For the 500k legion of chinese who got the OW banhammer first wk.
And now I'm facing wallet n'zoth paladins at the bottom of the ladder.
I know shit like that's the vaunted meta and all but you'd think they wouldn't be stuck down here like me.
Sorry you are having a bad time BwaS.
Good thing HotS is solving the equivalent problem tomorrow.
Where rank 1's can't duo-q with their rank 30 friend to gimp their mmr and fuck around with mid-tier games.
They can still quickmatch together right ?
Yeh but that place is a shitshow always anyway.
Worse ship naming skills than kancolle.
Cooked_Auto obviously MercyTrace should be called Tracy.
Also you have Symrah and Pharametra.
Thats the same ship.
ChaosSmurf if you want to be nostalgic L.
ChaosSmurf Lacuna Coil are in London in November.
GlennCuddlefish.
Well that was an interesting round.
2 minutes in my mouse dies.
Fortunately I was lucio no mouse needed Well okay it would be optimal but I can keep people up and about without.
Rip mouse. my condolences.
Got it working after 3 different batteries.
!note MairBear I am kind of upset with this FFXIV america only promotion.
GlennCuttlefish Zenyatta players learn very quickly that lacking a movement ability their only escape plan is to murder the everloving fuck out of anyone trying to hurt them. It.
And that is why I love playing zenyatta.
The quickest path to enlightenment.
The Star Wars session last night was interesting.
Very interesting v.
FYI - Avoid only lasts until you close Overwatch. |.
!note Noelor.
I guess it raining all night helped.
MairBear if i can spectate you for a win in the near future that'd be great.
I just killed myself by talking to glenn.
Cos my grenade button in FO4 is my PTT in mumble.
MoonWolf care to mumble?
Certainly is finland in here.
I haven't seen the weather forecast yet so can't put in my bet.
!weather forecast finland.
Need to know for the weekend of the 24th 10 day forecast looking pretty sunny so far.
You got me kicked for inactivity cos I was watching the video.
GlennCuttlefish THE FUCK GLENN.
What seems to be the problem moonwolf?
Not really true either. jäätelötötterö = ice cream cone.
Ah that makes more sense.
Varusteleka is fantastic.
Okay maplemap this was a terrible terrible time to be undermaintenance.
New tales is on PC apparently.
Well sure previous one was as well.
So the site i use to get backgrounds / levels for OTS.
Just decied to not use that thing anymore.
And that wouldn't be so bad except they also took away the ability to remove certain elements from the map in the new version.
Elements like ALL THE GAME RELATED NONSENSE LIKE MONSTERS.
Time to improvise.
Or if you're not going to improvise MoonWolf let me know like right now.
Before I leave.
Which is in a minute.
I'm just annoyed.
I don't know how anyone can be so cynical and dull they choose to play control elise-justicar-c'thun-and maybe even reno for all I know warrior.
But i play priest.
Felt good to win though with that garbage budget zoo deck. Esp given I got ddos'd out of my last round earlier.
Well this over brawl is an interesting one...
Glad you enjoyed that YT link.
Guess I'm using the birb this gen then.
This presents the question though is the owl Steven? or is the cat Amethyst?
Wouldn't the trainer be steven ?
I'd have to be the dude trainer though.
Or i guess girl trainer could be connie ?
Also connie not nearly in espisodes enough these days.
Though I did pick up the Steven Goes to School comic lately.
Topics the same so game still on?
Ok. omw home should be there in time.
Made the mistake of accompanying friend to store didnt mean to buy anything.
Left store with 4 cans of stuffed olives and a cheese.
You could have just gotten the 1 can.
Watching the Dishonored 2 gameplay presentation from E3.
The guy said they made it more vertical than 1.
And I'm like damn that's vertical.
Will justice be raining?
SOmething something vertical.
I guess that depends if the protagonists of the Dishonored series align with what you'd call Justice.
They really don't.
At least not in 1.
I thought not.
Noelor will you be joining us on mumble/roll20 ?
Well the new hero league fixes the queue saboteur problem.
Doesn't fix the focus morales mentality problem.
Why is that a problem ?
Is a good strategy.
Indeed but she's generally a well-positioned ranged support in the backline. Those who dive in to nab her get turned on and gibbed.
People who beeline for supports are literally satan.
MairBear well found.
Her healing is sustain not burst. Burst the frontline and she can't handle it.
Sustain against the frontline she goes oom and you can capitalise.
Dob apparently you won't enjoy HS brawl this week.
Its better with a large collection.
There's always faceless behemoth.
I won't mind so much someone dropping a turn 1 rag who pushes 8 to face immediately.
It's the ones who have him lightlord and the n'zoth dream team at rank 20 plus zero stars.
What about turn 1 aviana alex face rag faceless-on-the-rag?
Would probably be bemused and applaud.
I mean the 7 or above minions got a win there eventually. It was the 'can only find 30 out of druid and rogue that tilted me'.
From the Lightning Returns LP Happy E3 everyone! SInce XV's showing was awful let's celebrate with a better game.
Now I am not saying XV looked good.
But it still looks better than lightning returns.
ChaosSmurf Vince McMahon once did a wrestling match with Shawn Micheals a born again Christian where he had God represented as a spotlight as his tag team partner.
Noelor.
MoonWolf <totally a fuel source.
Also see Ghost Rider I guess?
Erm kinda won my first round at the tavern brawl.
I think my opponent was trying to run a CT deck? I'm not sure.
Dark arakkoa defs but some shredders too.
And raven idolising into innervate/wild growth S.
>57% of teams damage healed.
Tried base-racing me without having the board.
Annnnd the yield is 5 dust 3 commons and a rare no goldens.
Well the wotog pack from gold after that was a straight 40 dust from sharding all 5 duplicates.
Servant of yogg just made jaina a shadow priest =D.
Great thing is I can play ETC on curve play his yield card on the same turn and not the typical event where the ETC card helps my opponent take him out.
I don't even know what this deck is good against it's just cool - story of my life.
My only lament over tonights session is we have left the marrow glacier behind and I didn't get a chance to use lyrics from the Marrow Song c.
If you hover over a quest that is in a cave it will highlight the cave entrance on your map.
Best change since screenshot format.
Read more at.
“That will be revealed in the story of NieR Automata” Yoko-san told Siliconera. He also said that NieR Auotmata will have an “ultra happy ending” to which producer Yosuke Saito of Square Enix added “nobody is believing this right now even if he’s saying it.”.
!note MairBear The last time I played Fellowship I ended up beating up a kobold for his lunch =<.
Duplicate into ETC. The rock god got his encore and brought along a tribute band <3.
!note MairBear also Gnome sent out an update for the Dragon playbook a spelling correction and an art change.
MoonWolf I'm going to leave HS spectating you while I shower in the hopes you can win me a pack =.
If you're actually playing.
Noelor i'll try.
Enjoy your pack.
15 dust Angry Chicken golden Venture Co Merc.
Ie 65 dust and a chicken.
Also he released the full expansion for the Dragon well a nearly-finished preview.
Which has a relevant Destiny for Dragons!
MairBear do you have a normal sleeping schedule atm?
A relevant destiny? o.
Noelor it is one where you beocme a dragon.
Tldr I hoping you'd be playing Overwatch at 6am this morning p.
'cause I woke up at 530.
Sorry to disapoint.
You should be.
I had to play with randoms.
>kings row attack no-one picks tank.
>dorado defence 3 torbjorns.
I leveled up and got garbage at least ¯\_ツ_/¯.
MairBear it is called The Final Form.
One of its customs is called That Wasn't Even My Final Form.
Anyway it's actually available to anyone who a has high blood b casts magic c flies on the wings of a dragon.
So Thunder could also end up with it.
How the fuck do I type unicode symbols on a regular keyboard.
Thats not the awnser anathema.
MairBear its not BM if i really want to use Deathwing Dragonlord.
You always really want to use Deathwing Dragonlord.
MairBear did you see that bullshit ?
Oh he condeded before he could kill my deathwing dragonlord.
I did not.
MoonWolf people quit this brawl too easily.
Pizzas at work in 2.5 hours not sure I can last.
Eat a bagel.
Pizza has carbs.
Yes but also toppings + there is usually chicken bits.
I fucked up my wrist last weekend somehow.
Anathema name a week in w hich you have not somehow injured a bodypart in the last few months.
Its getting to be a trend.
Not true! it has been at least a 6 weeks since I actually injured my shoulder! Any other complaints were just why is this taking so long to heal.
Still you could be more careful ?
I am.
I think I slept on my wrist I have no recollection of an injury.
Also no way I'm gonna be sub 80kg for the race I've actually gained in the past few weeks p.
Is that important ?
No but it was a vague personal goal.
What does Tracer do when she's hungry? Goes back four seconds. This reddit I swear.
Did some prosopagnosia test online. Scored higher than I expected I would. Either face recognition works different from remembering faces or I got lucky.
Scored 51 out of 72 faces average is 58.
Thats not the worst.
As I said higher than I expected.
I did have a feeling of cognitive dissonance while doing it since I had no recollection what the face actually looks like but went with my gut instinct.
Yeah so with all these expansions it's now real easy for the fellowship to also become Threats to the World.
MairBear Briskle would have to become a robot.
And Peluna would have to learn Doom.
But I meant generally.
Awwh xD I hoped something special for each.
Nah just dragons and robots.
A robot walrus isn't special ?
And then harbingers already have a destiny.
Yeah they turn into mini overlords.
But also he added a Powerful version of Harbinger and Giant which can't take Destinies but get Threat as a levelup.
Gonna be a powerfull garbinger.
Because the one destiniy i really wanted is actually the aragorn one.
So if your fellowship is Powerful Harbinger Giant then there's a good 3+ destinies available for Threatening.
For the rest of the gang.
Harbinger can share Doom and/or Do Not Trifle I forget which is needed to open their Threat destiny to someone.
And then you need access to Dragon and Construct core moves.
Elves can share a single move from a playbook not in use.
MairBear i wish to challenge you to a match of hs brawl.
Also mubmle ?
KT brawl champion lovin it.
From a mirror image no less.
Huh TIL you can double spectate and see both hands D.
That... was a very interesting reaction.
The KT + Sylv.
Oh I thought i had 2 more hp.
Everyone's playing priest here as if they don't get enough cynical toxic wins on ladder.
BwaS i'm playing all the fun decks.
They've finally added steam queu customization with tag removal.
BwaS MoonWolf I played onyxia on turn 1 enemy conceded. Pure skills on my part.
Well this prat just went onyxia into power of the wild.
So goood.
Wait there was a squeenix conference today for nier automata?
Everything continues being terrible.
Nothing like an opponent dropping nozdormu to raise your apm.
Time to raise my APM.
MairBear a modder made a new cryssalid enemy type.
Oh its the boss battle that was at the end of the conference.
Still nier 2 looks great have to get a PS4 for that.
I see you basically stil have a grimmoire and danmaku bosses.
But where is the magical hand finishers.
GlennCuttlefish nothing personal just had enough for now p.
Lol some asshole got real mad at people getting XP in bot match.
I dont even know why.
What does it matter.
Just ranted and left the game.
It just gives you cosmetics.
Why do you care what way people get their xp.
People care about all sorts of things.
But it's miles less than pvp xp...
The shorts for annecy from gobelins are amazing again this year.
Damn it wrong hero.
But is it bigger than Corpsegrinders? Or I might be thinking of some other metal singer.
I'd play that mercy/reaper skin.
Deep in the simple.
It is compared to MTG.
Beaglerush I'm the best at snowballing. Nobody is at good as snowballing as i am. You can ask any of my friends.
So many implications. And I can't tell if he realizes the joke or not.
GlennCuttlefish MairBear MoonWolf sorry no game tonight - I am just not remotely in the right headspace for it rn.
Noted anything we can help with? c.
Well things suddenly went meta.
MairBear maybe I'll shoot some mens when I get home?
Mu okay no gaming is better than bad gaming.
Probably back later buuuut might not suddenly come over exhausted. So actually relief that the impending game is pushed back.
I'd like to proclaim today to be the fuck everything day.
It is settled then.
I hope you both have a better day tomorrow.
Oh hey new short from gobelins again. also that japanese bartender channel updated.
I still can't quite understand how this series went from cute miko doing miko things with a bear.
To bullying overdrive.
I finally got around to watching Gods of Egypt and I was surprised to see how much it played out like a mediocre game of Exalted. Or is it just me? Hah not a bad assessment.
DD5 has the disadvantage system that was the basis for Fellowship's hope/despair.
In DD5 you *cannot* start with a stat at 18 unless you roll dice for stats.
Nope turns out you need Rag to build a midrange hunter.
You do not NEED rag.
It'll suggest an alternative if you try to build it.
DD5 asks for your character's sex instead of gender.
One more for overwatch so we have a full premade? p.
This book has example scripts for Dwarven and Elven that are just character swaps for the English latin alphabet =X.
Something that would only annoy linguists v.
Look Cooked_Auto right.
*you* don't even use the English latin alphabet.
You think dwarves are going to?
At least it's not fucking rune script.
It is though!
It's just runes that directly represent English latin letters.
Finally a second link closely. Still no sign of a kathoon kathoon KATHOON though S.
Oh dear gods.
The spell list in DD5 is one long list of every single spell in alphabetical order.
What monsters approved this.
None of the people who did 4th ed.
Gotta harken back to ye olden days of 3.5.
Well I mean obviously.
But fucking hells.
Even 3.5 was sorted by level iirc.
Still a massive spell list followed by each spell explained in alphabetic order.
Ok I didn't believe you so hard I found the 3.5 PHB to check.
And you're right.
The lists by level in 3.5 gave brief descriptions.
5 is literally a list of spell names by level followed by full descriptions in alphabetic order.
So it's still the 3.5 way of doing it just with the extra descriptions removed.
And *over a decade later*.
As I said DD5 wanted to appease the 3.5 grogs a lot more after the percieved backlash they got over 4th.
I know this.
But fucking hell I didn't think they'd regress to something even less grokkable than 3rd.
I mean come on.
At least it's not PF vOv.
Turns out dropping a gadgetzan in the tavern brawl and trying to play miracle mage doesn't really work out.
Have you guys seen this lumbering mindgorger model from Legion.
It's super great.
Q What do you do when you're bad at fighting in the ocean?
A Beat up the ocean until it is no longer an ocean.
~when u ask ur bf to prom and he says yes~ ✿◠‿◠.
~when u turn urself into an unholy netherbeast limo so ur bf can ride u~ ✿◕‿◕.
~when the sky bleeds open and u arrive at prom w fire in ur wake the word of conquest in your brow and the wailing of the innocent clouding the air as if a celestial choir~ ✿ﾉ◕ヮ◕ﾉ*･ﾟ✧.
In the trans-human fashion future there are magical girl ARR mmo's.
These are the real questions in life.
Because fluids are a fucking pain to animate.
That...is certainly a scene.
Also does anyone here happen to have Legends of the wulin rulebook?
Nevre trust potatoes.
No bt I can try to find it.
If you dont have it no need I'll just wait for my friend to come online who has it for sure.
The new collections thing is fucking magic.
Shame it doesn't remember all the items you've deleted.
Ported my 3 main warriors over.
My old Lich King one has the sweetest fucking transmog.
That wasn't actually a transmog.
I'm sure Smurf will be overjoyed if anything.
Thats.. news too... anyone ?
But its backed up by SCIENCE now.
Helen Mirren is going to be in Fast Furious 8 doing her own driving. Ehehehehe.
8 of the damn things.
Please stop making those movies hollywood.
They're still pretty damn popular.
Visited yet another asian themed shop still no japanese curry cubes.
Did buy some thai mochi.
Whats wrong with paste ?
Nothing but I want to see how the cubes differ.
How is it so hard to go to the payload.
They didn't even have turrets set up half their team was guarding teleport or something.
Also why is it so hard to group up.
I try spamming it.
But nobody listens.
GlennCuttlefish how about when enemy goes 3 bastions.
And I as genji keep taking all 3 down but yet my team keeps blindly being mowed down.
So we lose.
This is ....
What am I.
Ian McKellan reading Fate Stay.
Another funny aspect about that in 1.1 and prior if a monster blew up a barrel on itself it would start fighting itself Doom!
I dont know how the irish did it.
But they've invented a beer.
That tastes like mämmi.
What even is mämmi ?
Turns out they invented it back in around 1710 but my point stands.
Its a kind of a fried rye porridge.
It doesn't look very appatizing.
Welcome to finnish cuisine.
So which irish beer is this?
Kilkenny I think?
Hmm not a name I'm familiar with p.
Huh Kilkenny isnt that bad from my memories of having it. Not a particularly huge favourite though.
I didn't say it was bad.
No its pretty okay.
Dug out camera before going to con this morning.
Turns out battery completely flat.
Left it charging all day at least I think I did.
It got nowhere.
Granted the AC adapter I got from the manufacturer was Aus pin and it was going through adapter to UK standard.
You'd think a nikon could figure that out right.
Are you sure this is a bird and not a helicopter.
Cooked_Auto i looked at doing pledges but they've got too many fiddly math balancing things and i can't do math in bonsai combined with touching to many other parts of the system so'd be huge to even do and too much interdependence between elements i can't really refer back or fowrards.
So i don 't think i can make that happen.
D.va has the quickest reactions ever you can't shoot during her E because she is manually shooting down the projectiles.
Pity her damage is shit.
Well inside the mech anyway.
If you are right next to them and shoot them in the face the damage is acceptable p.
Yes and pray they are too dumb to move a step back.
There is a 50% chance any given Overwatch player is too stupid to walk and breathe at the same time.
And there is a 100% chance that they are all on your team.
Well that might explain why I couldn't reach the SA forums a while ago.
Oh hey. a legendary skin for tracer.
GlennCuttlefish stop getting legendaries plx.
Glenn beat me to 100.
Forget the promise of progress and understanding for in the grim dark EU there is only law.
Well I pity any WH40k law student who runs into that.
Brain instantly derailed.
Or kicked out of the room for laughing so much.
I generated a worse weapon than tentacles for arms.
Bait ut a harrison jones play to mill your opponent?
And then they also take 4 random damage!
Only half an avenging wrath!
I think that's the one.
It also generated a bunch of weapons with Battlecry/Deathrattle destroy your opponents weapon.
I can see that one happening.
I could see a weapon/spell that'd be Destroy your opponents weapon gain some bonus based on it.
Destroy your opponents weapon gain its Attack.
Destroy your opponents weapon gain its durability.
2139 Destroy your opponents weapon gain its Attack. <- I was typing this yes.
As a rogue spell.
Or you know just straight up steal their weapon.
Thats a nice Arcane Reaper you have there.
I think i'll take it.
Well you say that with arcanite reaper it's the same.
Actually forget it.
Rogue does actually have a bunch of do your opponent's cards stuff.
Now I think about it.
Rogue tends to steal from the opponents Class.
To contrast priest who steal from your hand/deck/board.
I have eaten the banana thus disarming him!
But I was going to say something like Taking your opponent's potentially gives you more access to another class' *thing* than rogues should have.
But Burgle Huckster etc.
No ticket ey?
Stop asking questions!
Why should I?
SunTiger I finally got to retire that alchemical!
Half a year later.
Reinhardt running around without shield doesn't get to give advice I.
Maybe a reflection on such public voice chat?
And yeh mine's in splatoon mode. or maybe it isn't and I just never hear anyone on it.
SunTiger I finally got to retire that alchemical! \o/.
So I'm playing senran kagura again because mair is not around for getting angry at videogames one final time before I uninstall.
I feel the design philosophy was turn the fanservice up to 11.
And then someone said not enough.
And can see where all my teammates are through walls. I have the information I need. <- no you dont.
The times I wished my team announced when they are ulti-ing as mercy are myriad.
Or when they are pulling back/pushing.
Or just dying in general behind me.
And then someone said not enough <- i think they turned the fanservice up to the legal limit.
Still far from the legal limit I think.
Well without getting an adult rating.
You can 't sell sex if its adult rated.
I think they still could include implied sex which I haven't seen so far.
But then again the audience for this likes their fanservice pure.
Waifus can't have sex.
That'd ruin them.
Can't have used goods in my lewd videogames.
Goddamn it yesterday it was sunny and nice and now its grey and dreary and its been raining as well. Yet again terrible swimming weather >_>.
I've never understood that.
Its not a bad weather for swimming.
Its a bad weather for drying.
Maybe but swimming in an outdoor pool when its grey and dreary is not something I really want to do.
Its warm yet cold at the same time.
There is a plot ?
Well more of an excuse.
Differs with each faction.
We've reached an age of Advanced Memes.
I'm going to be disappointed if Dva Gremlin doesnt get added to the game in some fashion in the future considering how Blizzard loves their references.
My first impression is Wow that looks far too slow in just about everything.
Very shiny.
Holy shit that IS slow.
And not just the walking.
I mean yeah sure you're in terminator armor and all that but that's still a terrible excuse.
Also why is it called inquisitor if you are playing a space marine.
The fucks up with that.
No you're an inquisitor.
In terminator armor ?
Because inquisitors still have access to power armor and all that =p.
Still seems weird to m.
But i won't argue.
I am a badass inquisitor in power armor. let me walk backwards and shoot the enemy.
I'm not going to use my sword because it lacks aoe.
Also this is one hell of an underwhelming boss.
Big introduction followed by killing some mooks.
Finally attack boss all it does is shoot its gun.
It just has a gun.
I didn't even watch that far tbh as I was generally unimpressed by how it looked.
It does nothing but shoot gun and reload gun.
I'm not sure if a hellbrute is an existing 40k thing.
It is yes.
It's their new Dreadnought model pretty much.
Yeah its a chaos-y Dreadnought.
Anyway it just has a cannon on one arm.
And it shoot that.
Thats all it does.
Also the hellbrute shots don't even align correctly v.
Doing an inquisitor game wrong if you're a guy in terminator armour shooting all the things.
Should be more like Deus Ex or LA Noire.
There is an Eisenhorn game in development as well elsewhere.
Well one what anathema said.
But when it does get to a point an inquisitor has to throw down.
Don't they usually arrive with Armies ?
Depends on the severity of the threat.
Probably some Grey Knights.
No you pull out GKs when shit has gone Bad.
They do solo / small team stuff too.
I mean really fucking bad and you're dealing with major daemon incursion.
Otherwise you have either acolytes or call in Stormtroopers.
Grey Knights = this planet is fucked.
Well fucked or you have a place heavily infested.
But otherwise you just tell Arbites or PDF Yeah you're coming with me or call in Stormtroopers/Scions for a heavier punch.
Surely they don't have going in alone without support as a standard tactic though.
After that it tends to scale upwards where you bring in indentured IG or Marines if there's things to be assaulted.
So at least they guy should have someone with him.
Besides a servoskull.
Yes technically should.
Are *you* going to tell the Inquisitor he is doing his job wrong? p.
I'm going to tell the inquisitors writers they are anathema.
>Implying there's internal consistency in 40k v.
Well there should be.
Which would ruin some of the settings charm tbh.
I want to give DH2e another shot.
If anything I'm glad that they've partly moved away from This is so grimdarkdakrgrimgrimdarkdark arghrghrh to more black humor. THe Regimental Standard blog is really funny to read just because its absurd.
– I can see through the hull As many squad members as required should immediately remove their flak jackets and jam them into the holes in the hull. This will quickly and effectively ensure your continued safety. Troopers should contribute their armour in reverse height order. While it requires more sets of smaller.
Armour they’re harder to hit. Any holes remaining at this point once all troopers have contributed their armour can be used as additional firing points from the vehicle.
Two hours pass.
Aaand you've lost me.
We couldn't contact the supplier yet could you test it again so we can record the error message It worked perfectly this time.
Did the first line ping?
Test this software Ok... It didn't work Let's see if we can contact the supplier.
Now it make sense.
This is why you tell people to reboot!
Especially this computer!
You've been all three of your names in the last 3 minutes.
Tonight DD5 chargen.
I'm so sorry friend.
I have downloaded an app for spell selection.
I realised it's even more fucked btw.
Fucked how ?
When you level up you may learn more spells - refer to the class table.
The class table has but one column for spells known.
When you would learn a new spell it can be of any level you can cast.
In addition every time you level up you may replace one known spell with another available spell regardless of if you would learn a new spell that level.
Well thats simple enough.
It's not the worst when levelling up.
It's a nadache when creating a level X character where X > 1.
And is way more arcane than it needs to be.
Because you can't simply pick any spells you want.
Becuase you might not technically be able too.
Way more arcane than it needs to be is basically DD5's USP.
Well you see we had a system that was straightforward to use but then people complained it was all the same.
So here we are.
So glad I finally got to retire my alchemical though.
It only took for fucking ever.
It was a decently satisfying end to her story when we got there.
Who/what are you playing now ?
Jade caste agender solar hero stylist.
Punch everyone into the horizon.
Tesseract are playing Milton Keynes but on the dya I get back from Finland _.
's a hard life.
As if mei would marry a disgusting ****ian like her.
Clearly she would.
Not in my headcanon.
Mei is too pure for russians.
Hey MairBear want to get angry at videogames?
Is that a yer or a no? I still have that half a level to fill before I can uninstall.
That's a sure.
Let me just get to the next checkpoint of this quest.
Aprox how long will that take.
10 20 30 minutes?
Oh less than 10.
Making a cup of coffee meanwhile then.
I'll grab tea.
Deliver the breathtaking dress to Hildibrand. I shudder at the suggestion of my next objective.
MairBear what again.
Of course this dress could show more leg.
Then again its not as if we haven't seen a whole lot of manderville's anyway.
Oh there's no game tomorrow.
Might not be back on my pc until Friday then.
Busy week ?
Just a reminder I am nt here for tomorrow OR friday.
GlennCuttlefish hence the earliest date in the topic is 27th =.
But anyway I need to be in early Thursday.
So I can leave early.
To see a plasterer.
Yes but earliest date on topic is also last month.
That is true Glenn.
Evidently I can't type.
You can topic got rolled back when nickserv was rebooted.
Why are people pigs now in ff14 ?
I don't even.
Is this a seasonal event thing ?
SunTiger new flying mount.
Thats pretty cute.
So how many things do you need to grind to max for that ?
MairBear overwatch is getting Animated Sprays.
Shame that Glenn will never get any C.
What. A. Pity.
Well I might if they release that shortly before new skins.
Which is when I will download it again.
Sure doesn 't feel like 19C.
I dunno top 500? I would wager none of us would make that tier installed or otherwise.
I'll just play zenyata all day every day and turst that my zenyata game hasn't been a fluke so far.
Just embracing tranquility.
Cooked_Auto can i have your humidity.
I'd like to stop sweating because i dared to walk to the toilet.
At least it has gone down from the 86% I had during the morning.
K-Onverwatch was better.
Also Tracer is in no way melancholic.
Right I'll be back around saturday.
Also Tracer is in no way melancholic <- OR IS SHE.
For example we recently realized that “Avoid this player” was wreaking havoc on matchmaking. One of the best Widowmaker players in the world complained to us about long queue times. We looked into it and found that hundreds of other players had avoided him.
Actual solution should be making it so playing against a good widowmaker isnt the must un-fun thing in the entire game.
Wouldn't stop people from identifying key players in th eopposing team and avoiding them.
True but is it happening generally or just to widowmakers? p.
That widow was probably just the most easily usable example.
I doubt it was the only case.
But they got public complaints over that case.
DD5 has healing surges but calls them hit dice.
To really confuse anyone who played previous editions.
Minister see it turns out healing limitations were a great idea.
But the people they want to play their game HATE THEM.
SunTiger it's actually a pretty elegant implementation.
You get hit dice actually recovery dice per... day I think.
Wonder if I can last until 6pm without food.
Of a size determined by your classes?
When you short rest you can roll as many of them as you like and get that many hp back.
And the size of those dice is identical to the size of... what we used to call hit dice the dice used to determine hp.
I have considered running DD5 once we finish with Hero Quest.
But this part of the system is named awfully and also explained terribly.
It is explained so terribly in fact that multiple people at the table last night read it such that instead of having 3 hit dice at level three of size d8.
They had 3d8 hit dice.
Of unknown presumably regulatory size.
Last night in Warhammer our Wizard got a minor chaos manifestation of GM picks and GM picked upgrade to major and then the major one was roll twice first happens now second happens next time you cast a spell and the happens now one was roll again your closest kin suffers that effect and got possessed by a demon for 1m.
This speaks to DD5 in general I think.
It's not terribly designed albeit with some poor features deliberately included to appeal to a certain audience.
But the actual book is written and edited utterly awfully.
In such a way that it seems to almost intentionally obscure the information it holds.
Kirisu also intentionally discarding lessons learned from or ideas developed in 4e.
But see above re certain audience.
Another example actually I ran through character creation by reading through the book and determined that my character should have 15gp based on her background as an acolyte of the Dragon God.
To be told that actually she should have another 150g due to her being a bard but that piece of information was grim the section on what money is rather than the class chapter.
Not a druid ?
I am actually looking forward to playing DD mainly because of the group.
I thought just the mage was getting a new character.
On account of the ascencion to godhood.
Zheridi is a transgender dragonborn battlebard.
I may have decided to make a point when the book asked for my character's sex instead of gender.
For the record i'm disapointed you are playing a bard.
But what ?
I can play music and say Gon' make you feel better!
And if I can find the right spell also Break It Down.
Yes but DnD bards are just terrible.
I'll never like them.
According to The Internet they're the best class this ed.
I play a song that gives all my party members +1 or advantage or whatever.
I'm mathematically helping.
I cast as many spells as our warlock.
Can fight very nearly as well as our fighter.
Help our healing significantly.
And have significant bonuses to skill rolls.
Plus the music thing.
Which actually isn't an aoe this time I was disappointed.
Are you allowed to sing and do other things in this edition ?
Singing is a minor action iirc.
It gives one person +1d6 on a single d20 they roll in the subsequent 10 minutes.
1 ugh timing of minutes.
Or damage roll or they can add it to their AC those two options are because I'm specced into combat instead of smarts.
2 wow thats boring.
The die grows with my level.
Its not the die size i dislike.
It's DD SunTiger.
It's a game of maths.
And a die is more interesting than +1.
Iirc they can decide whether or not to add it after seeing their d20 result too.
So i know one game that did bards right.
Pillars of Eternity although its called a Chanter there.
Now it doesn't directly translate to tabletop mechanics.
But in PoE you have many songs to select from and they are mechanically more interesting than hit better.
I mean there is a few boring hit better and defend better songs.
But you also have aoe healthdrain everyone in the party leaves behind frost traps when they walk around etc.
That is cool.
Sing so hard your party members weapons are on fire.
Alas in this edition of DD those would definitely be spells.
Because anything interesting is a spell.
That said I can cast spells!
So anytime you finished a song or techncally a phrase of a song tabletop vs game mechanics etc.
And replace material components with playing music!
You build up a point of arbitrary resuorce.
And chanter spells cost 1 point of arbitrary resource per level.
And they have the really cool bullshit.
And becaues Chanters use the power of legendary poems/music/etc.
Instead of simply having music magic.
Did they add the person with a job mode I heard about to that game yet.
They have spells with names like Gernisc's Beast Lit the Night with his Breath.
And it summons a fucking dragon.
Might try it again some point this summer.
Also my bard *is* a dragon so there I.
Oh and also ernisc Slew the Beast but Soon Faced Its Kin.
Nah Chanters sound v cool.
Which summons a few tinier dragons.
I also like PoE's unstated premise that everyone is using magic.
I gave up and ate food.
I regret that decision.
SunTiger even fightmans?
Everyone is powering everything off of soul magic.
Nobody really realizes this.
Except for animancy who is just now really figuring out how the who world works.
So fightmans are not just game mechanics hard to kill.
Or every PC?
Not another Bhallspawn situation.
I mean average farmer over there in his normal farm is probably not really doing a whole lot.
But if you spend your whole life training how to do The Best Farming Ever.
Yeah you'd probably get some supernatural farming powers.
Granted not everyone has the same strength of soul.
So wizards all follow more or less the same wizard teachings and it works and its internally consistent. But ultimatly soul magic. Same for druids same for clerics.
Same for fightmans.
Rogues get to actually turn invisible and actually teleport.
Those are not gameplay conceits.
Fighters literally just regenerate terrible wounds take two handed maces to the face and knock down dragons.
It's a great setting.
Needs a pnp.
Also cultures vs races for things.
Oh god this overwatch brawl is just defense heroes.
Or as the randoms seem to think just Widowmaker and Hanzo.
Wow that straight up just doesn't work on phone at all.
Tumblr not a well designed site.
And all the terrible custom designs do not help.
It is SO BAD on mobile though.
It's just silly.
Gr8 b8 m8 don't h8.
H8ers gonna h8 h8 h8 h8 h8 / I'm just gonna shake... Shake it off!
My it's a rogue mirror down at rank 19 on the ladder soundtrack.
Goddamn it Bravely Second. Two-boss boss fight one is a healer I'm struggling to outdamage the healing while also healing my own team. So I start mana-draining him. Finally chew through his several thousand mana 2-300 at a time. Turns out bosses don't cast spells using mana.
Oh look this week's tavern brawl has mage synergy. How unusual.
What is it ?
Build 7 card deck. opening hand is drawn from it inc mulligan. post mulligan 23 esports.
And mage is the only class with low mana spell synergy cards.
Lock n load hype.
Yogg could be insane.
Really messing with the colourscheme here.
And thats why overwatch was disbanded.
!note Noelor.
Marvellous. getting walled off by freeze mages at the bottom of the ladder now.
SunTiger rank 15 control warrior.
So you've rejected our lord and saviour savannah highmane.
I'm fighting one who's being awful he's got nothing but rish cards so far and yet he's trading badly.
That's a really weird control.
That sure is a balanced item in bg2 early game.
Doomhammer is such a fair an balanced.
Tavern brawl. win on first round as mage v a lock.
Mage vs shaman won on my yogg saron.
Don't feel bad at all.
Pack is 4 commons and a legendary around about 5 or so since I unpacked an ysera.
Now going to try astral communion druid.
Maybe it's the hail mary Rag esportal that won me that round pulling the strings.
Good if you want to play control warrior ever.
Will solve my insomnia.
Yes it will.
If I dust him do I get Bindings of the Windseeker?
This pries seems to just have packed a starting hand full of removal.
Which i mean.
If you awnt to be boring.
Wtb your 15c.
This round oh hi reno jackson! <.
Trying to buy other peoples weather again?
Hmm coming upon the rank 15 floor boss for the first time.
... OH AND OF COURSE IT'S FUCKING FREEZE MAGE.
Anathema Yes. ‘Dredd 2′ is in development. Aaaaw yeeeeeeh.
Today is one of those great days where you wake up at 7 because its to damn warm to sleep.
Oh right today is find out if the EU is going to get fucked day.
<- watch out the overwatch ship police is here to make sure all ships are lore aproved.
MoonWolf nah results wont be in until after midnight.
MoonWolf you pirate ebooks right?
How and where and is there likely to be a book release today? p.
Torrents sites and #bookz on undernet.
And i'm not sure what you mean by that lats bit.
If it snot for sale as an ebook already it'll take time becuase it need to be scanned and orc'd.
A book was released today I bought a signed copy but had it shipped to my parent's house.
And popular enough someone does that.
Considered buying kindle.
But in this circumstance I am ethically OK with piracy.
The Nightmare Stacks.
I'm sorry but I think you're out of luck.
Book pirace is a little slow.
Its not high octane piracy like games or movies.
>kindle more expensive than paperback.
Digital distrubition will save consumers money.
Not if we give amazon an effective monopoly.
Facebook is not feeling well.
Got a buzz on my watch icon in the notification tray you have two notifications!
Open Facebook last notification Monday.
Oh wait fuck facebook.
Just seen an employee called M Meleady.
The entire country tipping their fedora.
You know you'd think Valve would bother to increase the server capacity for the steam store by now.
Instead of it turning into a sluggish mess every time.
They are over that idea.
I can't even get past the first entry in the exploration queue for the cards.
And F5 or Refresh is simply not a function that works anymore in steam.
I wish I knew why Steam decided that removing the loading circle from the browser was a good decision.
No wait its there. It's the refresh icon that's pointless v.
<- the evilist tracer plan.
Sort of watching a movie.
Watching a DD AP in prep for playing it.
They got to round two and my heart sank a little when the escalation die didn't appear.
Also I have learned that 5e monks have a lot of attacks.
I don't think our party has a one of those though.
They got to round two and my heart sank a little when the escalation die didn't appear <- esclation die works in any d20 game.
I mean its not exactly balanced around it and you don't get esc die mechanics.
But you can still use it.
I may petition our DM to add it.
My other DM friend who only runs 13th age thinks you totally should.
I mean I would rather just play 13A full stop =P.
Everyone else was on board for DD though and I like the group.
So here I am a bard instead of a paladorcerer or wild mage.
Should have made a paladorcerer instead.
I'm not 100% sold on 5e sorcerer.
We do have one in the party though so I'll get to see how it works.
But like you get a pool of sorcery points that you use for basically flexible metamagic.
Is it still extra slow metamagic compared to wizards ?
And other stuff like you can exchange it with spell slots.
I don't think wizards get metamagic.
Feats in general aren't baked into 5e.
They're there but optional.
Wizards get bonuses based on favoured school I think.
But they're fixed as opposed to the sorcerer's flexible thing.
Overwatch earned $269 million in May while Battleborn earned $18 million says analyst.
We don't have a wizard though so I may be entirely wrong.
MoonWolf poor Battleborn.
Do you have any straight up fightymans ?
Forever fated to be a punchline first in people's minds.
Paladin and fighter.
And my bard is fight spec.
I'm afraid the fighter will regret his choice.
Minister sure but you still get fun stuff besides attack.
Also we have a cleric though she's lore spec.
The fighter and paladin are the *players* least likely to show up.
Also fighters get... options I think?
Idk what kind of fighter we have.
Other than dorf.
What we don't have at all is anyone Dex-based.
Because I wanted to be a dragonborn.
Instead of idk something elf-shaped?
1/2 drow whatevs.
In my next fantasy settings there won't be humans.
Just Elves with round ears.
Dark elves high elves wood elves round elves extra pointy elves.
Humans in 5e btw have +1 to all stats instead of one +2 and one +1.
Which is... something.
The blandest of bland.
Meanwhile as dragonborn I have breath weapon.
But this being 5e that breath weapon is a cone in which everyone takes damage save for 1/2.
It could have been a line if I'd picked a different colour of heritage.
What colour are you ?
We were told metallic only or I'd have been green.
No clue what silvers do.
My guessing is imaculate.
I installed a third party android app for making/tracking spellbooks.
Including a sortable filterable database of all the spells from all the books.
So I can actually look at spells at all.
Don't you like going through 3 books worth of spells without any sane way to organize them ?
And now I have a decent format for them there are some decent design decisions relatively.
It's like PHB and one small supplement.
They mostly only publish adventures for whatever reason.
Loads of spells scale based on what level spell slot you cast them from.
At least they learned something there.
Also Bear's Endurance / Owl's Wisdom etc are all one spell called Enhance Ability you pick the ability on casting.
And the physical abilities give additional effects.
Should have ditched them entirely imho.
But thats probably not dnd enough.
They give Advantage instead of +2.
I've taken it.
Because the bonus from the Constitution version is thp.
Which means it is Break It Down.
Avery single target break it down.
It's level scaling is extra targets!
Oh right Twitter has started being about the EU for one last intense burst as the votes are counted.
Let's just mute those two letters for tonight.
Oh shit right damage only scales with level for casters as well.
I am going to be so happy to play 13A the night after 5e.
We're back to scaling combat characters' damage by giving them more attacks/turn.
Thats not great.
And uh only fighter ever gets more than 2?
Anyone else awake?
Welp world is fucked.
Great job brittain.
Gonna immigrate to another country and steal someones job now.
Well thats a first a combination of humidity and hunger woke me up before my alarm clock did and I cant get back to sleep.
MoonWolf Hahaha.
The eternal LP.
Soon the sakura wars lp will die and it'll be the oldest i think.
The Sakura Wars LP did die. Last year v.
I was about to mention it when you said it.
Man I almost need more LPs to follow. my bookmark list is getting thin.
Oh snap the God of War 2 LP is up.
And I've even missed TDIs new LP. Man I'm bad.
Well tbf I might have unfollowed the FFX thread before the announcement.
Welp latest GK update is ruined for me because all I can think of is that atrocious page from the Angela comics with Unsolicitied Opinions about Israel v.
The reddit brexit post has 25k comments that is the most I've ever seen.
And its completly unreadable because reddits system breaks down in threads with say more than 100 posts.
Studio Trigger saves anime again.
How was your work day probably depressing.
Noelor the fuck is this video.
Had a job interview today on this morning after.
Massive elephant in the room.
We need something inspiring after BE... Sean Bean's not doing much?
Interviewer talking of 'partnerships' in more of a business sense and he sounded in the remain camp over it.
Cba to discuss sorry.
Lol some vaguely asian culture is building grecoroman temples.
Also vaguely european brick miletary camp.
Ah yes the famous Chinese Mounted full plate lancers.
I remember those.
Darn forgot to log into IRC so I've been missing out on all the political doomsaying/celebration.
I did D.
Btw for eveyrone who missed it.
The overwatch ship police is here.
No shipping the wrong ships.
And those ships are all wrong too.
No gay ships only Zarya is gay.
Don't ask me how i know she is gay and nobody else is.
This is just a fact now.
Also you can't ship people who are enemies. Because I said so.
But shipping tracer with winston is perfectly fine though.
And the last two make zero sense and are just uuuuh let's do these just because.
Also not shipping widowmaker because she can't feel love.
Thats basically fanfiction author angst/healing it with love crack cocaine right there.
Of the supplied list of Approved Ships.
Only Lucio D.Va and Genji Mercy make any sort of sense.
Metallised fibre why is this in clothes.
Í don't even know what that is.
Presumably its not Mettalic Fibre.
Genji/Mercy only works from a weird doctor/patient angle.
So uhm. Thats some classic romance setup Right There Cooked_Auto.
You may think its weird but on the whole pretty accepted setup.
I don't /.
Refrain from shipping D.Va with older characters she isn’t even 20 yet I mean that's reasonable.
That's the one reasonable line here.
I'm just saying it's like the only real angle for it.
While the others can have variable approaches as to why it would happen.
Genji is a robot.
Did Mercy give him a robopenis?
In this scenario?
'Don't ship D.Va but she is one of my approved ships'.
I don't follow Pharanzo.
Noelor Metallised fibre why is this in clothes - For a bunch of reasons Mostly because google points me towards Metallic fibre with that search I should add.
Noelor Also sure don't ship D.Va with the other half of the cast but are you really going to be upset if someone ships a 19 year old with a lower half of 20 ?
Seriously don't see an issue with or Lucio or Junkrat here.
MoonWolf I'm saying this person is breaking their own rules.
Obviously I am on board with D.Vacer.
I prefer PharMercy and 76Mercy. With a dash of Zarcer on the side for the adorable height difference.
And D.Vucio in a celebrity power couple context.
Pharercy is the realest.
Or might Traya works better there.
Mainly because it's got in-game basis.
A friend of mine pointed out the mechanical benefits of such a ship yes =p.
I have a weird preferenec for Pharah/Mercy/Symmetra. But nobody else in the world even ships that.
I guess that works.
I feel weird shipping Symmetra >.>.
She a perferctly functional adult Noelor.
Just has issues with disorder.
So clearly she should be shipped with Junkrat.
I mean if you want too ?
MoonWolf I accept that it's a dumb hangup on my part.
I feel this would lead to headlines like Couple beats eachother up in street with their prostetics limbs.
I just realized those rules are really scattershot because they ignore Junkrat and Roadhog except in the banned list.
Banned from shipping.
No shipping australians.
Junkrat is just not relationship material if we're being real.
Not that anyone cares.
There is a large amount of Junkrat/roadhog out there.
Seen plenty of Mcree/Hanzo as well.
Accurate af comments one of my OW playing friends.
>name forms with Reverend and not Mx.
Looking at deed poll documentation for a laugh.
It's a pretty important legal document so it has to be not only witness but *double* witnessed.
You... you double witness!
Is that when someone witnesses the witness ?
So you fill it out and someone says yeah they're who they say they are *and* a solicitor/judge says yeah that witness is real and witnessed that.
I definitly saw that witness say that!
Also the witness has to meet the following criteria.
Not a close relative of mine nor of a partner if I had one.
A british citizen this being a document for british courts.
Have known me for no less than 10 years.
A home owner.
Well that's me out.
Right? you were doing really well.
But then that last beat.
Dob doesn't own his house.
His mum owns his house.
This is a really weird requirement.
You rent ? DISQUALIFIED.
Don't they often have profession/position of credibility requirements too?
The venn diagram of People I'm Out To and People I've Known for 10+ Years is fairly slim anyway.
Being all of y'all and my family.
Oh your out to your parents now ?
When did that happen ?
If you said i wasn't there for it.
How'd that go ?
It was awkward they haven't disowned me or anything.
I guess that was the expected outcome.
It's not exactly a topic of conversation among us though.
Just means I'm not scrubbing my nails clean when they come round or whatever.
Also less stress!
So back to this fucking form.
This seems somewhat... overly... harsh.
It's not designed for trans people.
It's designed for people getting married and whatnot.
Even then ?
Like up to not a relative partner and british citizen i'm onboard.
After that it goes really weird.
10 fucking years ?
Own a house ?
The 10 years thing is weird until you bear in mind that this is a document to *change someone's identity*.
They want to be real sure you're who you say you are/were.
Home ownership is according to the supporting documents required to prove the witness is a permanent resident within the United Kingdom.
All the home owners I know are either people I work with who I've known for 6 years tops.
Or in my parents' social circle.
And therefore not people I'd be comfortable asking for this given the surrounding conversation.
AND I don't even know if this form is supposed to be used for titles actually.
They need a trivial changes form.
It certainly doesn't have anything about gender.
It's strictly name.
Oh I found the gender forms.
Are you ready to be angry!
You are only allowed to use them if you're diagnosed with gender dysphoria.
I assume by a doctor.
Possibly more than 1.
Or have already had surgery!
You've lived in your acquired gender in the UK for at least 2 years.
The FUCK uk.
Related story not directly about me.
A colleague and his partner are taking their baby on holiday this summer - the first time said baby will leave the country.
Therefore they applied for a passport for said baby.
The application was rejected.
Because the parents have different family names.
Doesn't it just go under parents passport untill some age ?
They had to have the document signed by... I think at least two of *their* parents?
Okay Trans and Gender Queer people aside for the moment.
If so it's over said age now it's 7 or so months I think.
Fucking Its 2016.
People are sort of treating marriage/names very differently now lawmakers.
Get with the fucking time.
The baby has its father's name incidentally rather than the mother's.
This isn't even weird anymore its the new normal.
This is the largest in a series of passive-aggressive moves on her part to pressure him into proposing.
Wait they have kids together but she wants to pressure him into proposing ?
Lady you are doing this wrong.
Which he is now at a point of refusing to do out of principle.
This is clearly not working.
He agrees with me that if she wants a marriage she can propose herself.
But ah well.
This is what we get for not using the Icelandic/Bulgarian/etc naming system.
So basically this.
Closed tab at I'm your slave and I'm your master.
Not to kinkshame or anything.
Just cba with that song.
Yeh was a bit trash at the time for that I agree.
Tell me that #scoxit is not becoming a new thing on twitter.
The subject I don't mind.
But I just didn't imagine a buzzword WORSE than Brexit.
Thought they were going for indyref2.
I hope so.
Oh please there are much worse like Departugal Italeave Fruckoff Czechout Oustria Finish Latervia Byegium Luxembark Splitzerland Retireland Exitpol Adieutschland Ditchenstein.
There's also 'scotlond' considering Scotland London were for staying.
Some of those are amusing thought!
MairBear our nationalist party is asking of an unironic Nexit.
I would totally support Free City State London.
It'd be better than Nexit but the trend has been set BwaS.
Granted Netherleaves sound like a WoW Herb.
Used to make Nethertea or some really important raid potion v.
Or a brilliant euphamism.
Or what Adam and Eve wore.
Good thing though we'd need to have a constitution change before we could even have suhc a referendum.
So thats good.
I declare this brawl to be officially garbage.
But I have the win 3 brawls and already used my reset.
Yeah i'm not a fan of this brawl either.
Tempo mage is okay.
If you have a yogg i don't think you do its an okay include.
Some people just run priest with a handfull of removal.
Nah only Servany.
I tried ramp druid 2x innervate into the 10 mana spell.
It wasn't great.
Sure you can get 10 mana but you still only draw one portal per turn and unless you get lucky you don't more draw.
There might be some merit in a trogg deck ?
I nearly got owned by a trogg deck.
Guess there is some merit then.
That sounds like a good substitution.
You got some good spring onions.
Make some fried rice.
Or a nice omelette.
MairBear this is glorious bullshit.
Figures it is getting more humid.
Humidity isn't great but at least the temp is cool.
So i can get actual sleep tonight.
In my case I assume more rain tonight. Which is good if anythinmg.
Ooh another one.
This is pretty accurate tbh.
That's kind of horrifying.
MairBear> Well <- fuck off.
Noelor its glorious though.
MairBear watching people on a stream pronounce Rie-san as Rai-san.
Gritting my teeth.
It's not that hard.
What is a rie-san though? C.
Also that famous Street fighter character Rye yuu.
MairBear a character in some anime game.
MoonWolf rank 14.
I just got killed by rend.
Because... paladins run that now to counter tyrion...
What dragon ?
Just all the dragons.
In a priest deck.
He used it to kill his own sylvanas to steal mine.
Clear my ass it's raining right now v.
!note MairBear.
I mean I suppose that's better than when her Ult did that.
I see Kratos still moos like a cow whenever he tries to shove a box somewhere.
It's only the second God of War game and it's already involving time travel.
Welp v.
No no thats not okay.
You need mental help!
I'm not sure it is!
That certainly isn't.
LOD is great.
THANKS JAPAN.
Wait who's the backing dancer?
I have no clue.
Some odd dancing video afaik.
I survived meeting with people.
So it seems.
Kindle for £2.98 Paperback for £98.68 whut.
Not that I would buy a novel in paperback anyway but.
The fuck are they printing it ON.
Can only assume it's got a huge shipping fee baked in?
I assume its PoD so its not the cost of getting a run going.
Is it like limited print reseller or something.
Why are you browsing Black Library books? v.
Oh gods they're putting Hugo Nominated on the covers now.
Been doing that for a while now.
Noelor well he was!
Imagine if he won.
From Hugo-winning author Chuck Tingle Pounded in the Butt by The Hugo Award Won by Chuck Tingle.
Cooked_Auto strangely enough I don't follow Chuck Tingle's work that closely.
I thought you'd be all about the self referential recursive gay sex with athromorphesized objects and abstract concepts.
Maybe if it were self-referential recursive lesbian sex with anthropomorphised abstract concepts.
The objects and dick-in-butt aren't my jam.
Im sure you'll find something like that that will tickle your fancy some day.
You know somehow i don't think lesbian sex would make me want to read those books any more.
Than i do currently.
Can't think why.
Clearly below his refined tastes.
Probably just biased against terrible paid for online written porn.
If i want some of that i can get so much fanfic/original fiction thats also terrible but for free.
And havent looked for the good stuff =p.
Well i'm reading some good stuff but non of that is erotic.
Like queer fantasy ww2 story The Spirits of Eden.
And The names of god are magic and we broke the world when we tried to land on the moon in the 70's unsong.
My only reading recently has been more of the Eddie Chase Nina Wilde books.
Unsong is great but nerdy as FUCK.
Just had to phone up Scientology.
But i love it for stuff like this In retrospect there had been omens and portents. A series of very precise lightning strikes seared the word “OMEN” into the rust-red sand of the Sonora Desert scientists blamed “phytoplankton”.
Noelor i'm sorry.
Had forgotten they don't alway use that name got very confused.
MoonWolf they've been sending their magazine to my flat addressed to someone who presumably used to live here.
Well yeah that name is stigmatized to hell and back these days so of course they want to be evaise.
The magazine is just called SUCCESS incidentally.
Which amuses me.
Noelor flat confirmed to be infested by Thetans.
Did they actually let you cancel it or did they act like a bunch of assholes about it ?
I haven't heard of that person.
Which I mean.
Sure stop sending them magazines then.
We'll see if they actually do.
I very specifically only gave them the former resident's name though.
For reasons I hope are obvious.
Once a month or so we get a boat shipping magazine adressed ot the former owner of the house in our mailbox. Cant remember if we ever bothered telling them that its the wrong adress.
Otherwise you might just have started receiginb it in your name with the bill attached.
But the other mail I rang up to stop beforehand went much better.
I received three letters in the space of a week for someone so figured I'd open it up and it was a debt agency.
Rang them up very understanding.
Probably because it wasn't an exploitative money sucing vampire religion.
Only half of that!
I've used my phone a lot today in fact.
Three whole phone calls!
How social of you.
The middle one was to a robot to arrange collection of a parcel.
They're a very specific set of people I can communicate with using only buttons.
Maybe in the future they will be.
MairBear I didn't last for nearly as long as I hoped.
Already reinstalled overwatch.
Thought you'd last at least a month.
Untill like a content patch.
Mostly cos I'm not even l100 yet.
I'm level 50ish!
Look people had words with me.
And I had to do it.
Was this during the living in a cabin period ?
Well besides there being no cabin yes I think?
Ah spray combos.
Beautiful spray combos.
Sorry WHAT.
That certainly was some Widowmaking.
That is huuumid.
I have my tablefan going full bore and it's not fucking helping.
Even the air that is blowing is warm.
MairBear been playing as warlock for quest and ranks - in that game I missed lethal for a turn because my hand was so full I didn't see Leeroy in it.
Going to stop at 14 I think.
For tonight anyway.
GlennCuttlefish yo when's a good day before Saturday for drinks?
Err. tuesday thursday would be best I think.
GlennCuttlefish tuesday is probably good will confirm later today.
Wait what va-11 hall-a got released while I was away?
Friday as far as I can remember.
This game is best played getting comfortable. Grab some drinks get some snaks and enjoy.
I just drank most of my remaining vodka yesterday with friend m.
Typo was all mine.
Nope in the cyberpunk bartending future there are snaks.
But I dont have any snaks either.
Then you should proceed to buy some snaks.
Chisps are a great snak.
So far the writing in this is decent enough graphics are good for what its going for and the soundtrack is great.
Its basically a Vn with a minigame though isn't it ?
Even the bird gets a bow.
Gramma Torbjorn is p great.
Kinda worried about Tracer's lack of a nose.
Its being squashed byt the visor thing.
Adserv or g-ads or whatever keeps giving me an annoying ad.
ANDROGYNOUS IS THE NEW BLACK it declares next to a picture of a lady in a dress shirt with a bow tie under a title Mrs Bow Tie.
The ad is for a shop that sells swimwear.
And no bow ties.
I'm doing shopping for my DD character.
Which means spreadsheets!
For value *and* for weight.
Are you really doing weight ?
On weight her starting equipment includes items whose weights aren't listed and thus must be induced from other similar items.
I could probably not.
Her starting equipment includes items whose weights aren't liste FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
The Adventuring Gear list includes Paper and Parchment.
I feel like if you are ever going to care about weight it hsould be when players are personally starting to carry multiple sets of armor and weapons around and shit like that.
Two separate entries different prices.
No explanation given as to what meaningful differences there are between those things.
Noelor this is the dumbest.
Welp you'd get a conniption from Shadowrun then v.
Cooked_Auto probably yes.
You'll note i've not once cared about what you guys lug around in OTS or TGAO except when it included things that are notably difficult to move around as just people.
Like barrels of explosives.
Granted that game is meant to be gear heavy so it will involve a lot of shopping. And rolling for shopping.
The recommended reading section in this book is notable to me for including the phrase And the rest of the... series a lot.
So they're following the D3 Demo Barbarian principle?
Noelor which book ?
I assume 5e PHB.
Yeah but the 5e line has like 3 books.
S'the only one I need.
I mean why would Noelor need to read the DMG or MM?
Magic items are meant to be rare in 5e.
Sure they are.
So in fact no but it wouldn't be an unreasonable expectation.
So you can dream of items you'll never get? =p.
After this weight spreadsheet I'm kind of wishing I had a bag of holding.
I really wish CGL would get their failed asses in gear and release the slimmed down SR5 rules but apparently they're too busy fucking up or something.
They're busy putting more rules in Cooked_Auto.
No from what I've heard from a friend they lost/git rid of critical personel which has ground their release schedule to a halt.
Heck even the SR tumblr has been silent for about a month now.
At which point you kind of figure out that something is fucky.
Yeah you're not getting those then.
Not that it matters since the SR game is on the major backburner with Star Wars ongoing and a secound round of Changeling happening after that possibly.
Have you considered playing a game about bartending in a cyberpunk bar instead ?
GlennCuttlefish likes it.
No thanks. I still have both SRR games to finish anyway at some point p.
Meanwhile I'd rather just fume over FFG more and the fact there is no release date for the Age of Rebellion Soldier book yet.
Hey this is pure cyberpunk dont go throwing it in with that wishy washy fantasy stuff.
But knowing the speed of SWRPG scans it'll be 2018 until I get my hands on the book anyway.
Real serious cyberpunk this. I work in a pub that was reserved for corgis last week.
D12s in this edition are once more only used for barbarians.
Why break the standards?
Well and greataxe but who uses those other than barbarians right?
Orc fighters? v.
Cooked_Auto those are just fighters in heavier armor.
Always with the typecasting MoonWolf >|.
Have you no shame?
Tons of it.
Crits in DD 5e are not maximising damage.
Nor are they doubling damage.
They double the dice you roll without changing fixed modifiers.
Its the most extra work yay!
Oh gods I made the mistake of looking at the wizard.
Their spell system is even more complicated.
If you're a wizard you Know X cantrips based on level can cast them whenever.
Have a spellbook with Y spells in it gained through leveling up and/or finding scrolls or whatever.
Prepare spells from your spell book you prepare Z spells each morning there's no level restriction on this.
And each day you can cast A 1st-level spells B 2nd-level spells C 3rd-level spells etc.
And can pick any prepared spell when casting.
So they are pseudo sorcerers in this edition.
Every caster in the game runs on spell slots.
Wizards just have the funkiest way of setting up what spells those slots call from because wizards must resemble vancian magic or we're all doomed.
I'm going to make a dnd heartbreaker where wizards are allowed to cast 1 spell per day.
Warlocks bards sorcerers all just know X spells and can cast however many per day.
Really high level wizards are allowed 2 or sometimes 3!
Warlocks have invocations bards do combat sorcerers get metamagic.
Are there any summoning spells ?
Conjure Animals/Celestial/Elemental/Fey/Minor Elemental/Woodland Being.
Okay good you can still trivially break the action economy!
Those range from spell-level 3-7.
What a shame.
No level 1 summoners.
Oh hey Contingency's here too.
My biggest gripe so far is that the jukebox lacks a randomizer.
Ok so spell slots go up with level this makes sense.
Let's imagine a character levelling up from 17 to 18 in a spell-casting class.
What spell slots do you think they might gain?
Noelor they'd gain one level 9 spellslot ?
Hahaha oh MoonWolf.
Don't be silly.
The answer is of course one 5th-level spell slot!
Ah yes. ofcourse.
That makes sense.
Oh here's something vaguely cool.
Smite Ev- I mean Divine Smite.
Hey thats a good thing.
They did a good thing!
Eats up paladin spell slots to do extra damage.
Instead of a messy uses/day formula.
The extra damage is based on the level of the slot used.
Can you choose if/what level of spell slot ?
Can i smite if i'm out of spells ?
Yes and no respectively.
Okay so no smiting untill you've cast your high level spells.
Otherwsie you are burning good value spellslots for raw damage.
This game is actually real good for multiclassing incidentally.
What if i want to be a gish ?
Roll a bard.
What if i have an irrational hatred of bards ?
Eldritch knight is a spec of fighter lemme check what ability it casts with.
So you could multiclass it with wizard if you wanted more spells.
What if i want to be a cleric/wizard ?
Your biggest problem is MAD.
Well i won't care for defenses too much because i'm going to be backline.
Unlike a cleric.
Proficiency the bonus you add to attack/skill rolls is based on character level.
Spell slots are shared among all casting classes and your level for purposes of how many you have is total of full-caster levels+half total of ranger + paladin+third of total of eldritch knight + arcane trickster.
A handful of class features have notes that they don't double up mainly the Extra attack feature that's found at 5th level of all the combat classes.
So a cleric/wizard would just have full spell slots.
But half the progression speed ?
If your only classes are cleric and wizard you have full spell slot progression.
But spells known based on your separate levels.
But almost any spell that involves rolling dice now scales with level.
And here level would be level of class or total levels of all my classes combined ?
Because if its the first its SHIT.
Okay let's say you're wiz5/clr5.
Your spellbook has at least 14 wizard spells in it and they can be up to 3rd level.
Likewise your god will grant you cleric spells up to 3rd level.
Your spell slots go up to 5th level.
So you can cast scaled up level 3 spells ?
Okay that makes it an interesting thing to play.
So you could use your 2 5th-level spells to cast a 5th-level Fireball 10d6 instead of 8d6 damage.
Generally you play a cleric/wizard combation to be a buff monster.
5th-level Mass Healing Word.
In other editions combinations like that had lower level spells but a LOT of them.
Buffs tend to scale number of targets with higher-level slots.
And Mystic Theurge the PRC associated with this combination usually allowed you to combine spellcasts or pump a lot of spells out in one turn.
Or back in 2e because of how xp tables worked.
Enhance Ability is 2nd-level grants advantage on rolls of pick an ability and out of a 5th-level slot it would buff 4 targets.
You were only barely behind a full caster.
And could do ridiculous things.
Like casting all the cleric combat self buffs they had many of them to prop them up to or beyond fighters and then self polymorph into something ridiculous.
The only real restriction is that you can only multiclass into a class if you have at least 13 in its primary ability.
13 doesn't seem that hard to get if you are aiming for a casting centric variation.
Split your int/wis into 16/16.
3 classes have 2 primary abilities.
Buff later with magic items.
Point-buy gives way lower values this ed.
But still true.
You could get 16/16 but you'd have to pick exactly the right race.
Or have silly low dump stats.
Dump all the charisma.
Who needs it anyway.
In fact point-buy caps at 15.
Before or after race ?
Fine 15/15 then.
So you can get multiple 16s as human at least.
And then whatever race is your thing.
Oh or half-elf.
The new part timer at my pub? a corgi in a hawaii shirt.
Half-elf is +2 to cha +1 to two others.
But i wanted to dump cha.
Well then human.
+1 to all.
No race gives +int/+wis.
There are feats that raise your abilities though.
Alongside other benefits.
Though I guess this is because feats are always taken instead of an ability increase.
You get +1 to two abilities or +2 to one or a feat every 4th level.
Humans can trade out 4 of their +1s for a feat and an extra skill proficiency.
Also abilities are always capped at 20.
Its just like my fanfictions.
I'm reading a book on the history of islam and it obviously starts with a summary of the religious milieu of 6th Century Arabia.
TIL Ahriman = Angra Mainyu.
At different times in Zoroastrianism.
You on a gchq watchlist now then?
Aren't we all?
BwaS i'm not!
I'm on a AIVD watchlist.
<- turns out you can also just airbust d.va ulti.
Because its range is ridiculous.
Would be nice if that showed the trajectory.
Because I've been trying to do that with little success.
Bah. I should do baking of all kinds but I am feeling too lazy.
Got a bag of apples I need to get rid of. Also was thinking of making a spinach-feta-mushroom quiche.
I've got a boring old regular Quiche lorraine in the oven right now.
So we're doing a weekly dinnerbox so today we had a teriyaki mince with noodles. It was a bit on the thin side content wise.
MoonWolf so I googled that acronym.
And have now spent multiple minutes trying to say Veiligheidsdienst.
Fuck your g mainly.
On food I waited in all afternoon for a courier who hasn't shown up and now it's pissing it down.
So instead of having gone to the shops after said courier's arrival for veggies I'm going to have a shake for dinner.
And have now spent multiple minutes trying to say Veiligheidsdienst <- sorry.
No you're not.
You've seen right through me.
TIL an important thing OTP for triads is OT3.
As opposed to OTT?
I guess that's already Over The Top.
I don't make up the acronyms.
MoonWolf .... amazing.
Its a real drama.
Better lovestory than twilight.
In the end I didn't even make a quiche.
But a pie.
Well i had a quiche.
It was a little to moist.
Made this not-quite cream puff dough for it.
So a bake dough ?
Err at least not according to google.
I heated up water and butter in a pan to a boil mixed some flour into that let it cool for 5 minutes after which I mixed in 2 eggs some salt and baking powder.
Dough you make in a pan.
I'm bad at cooking in english okay.
I wasn't accusing you I'm terrible at cooking terminology no matter the language.
Now I just have to do something about the apples.
And I'm damned if I'm going to make a second pie.
So cyberpunk bartender simulator features this.
Which it turns out they made a real site.
They tagged the super lewd handholding porn as #NTR.
Hm. sounds like too much work. I think I'll make...thing. slice apples into a pan sprinkle cinnamon on top cover with oatmeal butter and sugar mixture bake for 30 minutes or something.
Thing sounds pretty good.
I should make some thing sometime.
I'm sure its a thing in english speaking countries as well just cant figure out its name.
Since its name is retarded in finnish literally apple good.
Apple IS good.
Daily quest gold go for a wotog pack.
2nd card hover over is orange.
Its not terrible!
Its much better than anomelous.
Plan b will make apples tomorrow.
Found out my wrist hurts too much to peel them today.
One day I will create a fruit that takes away thirst.
Its just watermelon without the melon bits.
So a bag of water?
One that you can eat yes.
So a bag of ice?
Still cant eat the bag really.
Well if its ice you don't really need the bag.
Then it's just an ice fruit.
HCT Americas final. Freeze mage v mid hunt. Post ice block topdecks arc int into fireball lethal. Fuck freeze mages.
This pie turned out better than I expected.
I was afraid the mushrooms would cover the other flavours.
While I do like this cyberpunk bartendering the chan pandering is a bit much at times.
Chan pandering ?
Anime is for nerds.
Fun is just a buzzword GlennCuttlefish.
Fun is killing esport.
Wait was that it.
Did I miss something.
Did I get the bad ending?
Only one way to find out.
Replay and do the opposite.
I'm not even sure what I could do in opposite.
Better replay it anyway to find out.
FFXIV... massively hypes me for a fight cutscenes theme music continues after cutscene in the zone I'm in time to fight a boss.... DENIED you need 4 more item levels.
Why can't we have a l ittle leess rain this summer.
The best team.
Well that's strange windows doesn't want to download any updates.
Yeah I dunno why.
It finds them but refuses to download them. The troubleshooter does give me an error but finding a solution is finicky.
Oh nvm it seems to work now vOv.
Might have been Silverlight not being updated.
There we go. rebooting.
God I love SSDs.
Aw 3.
Oh damn.
Anub'arak you seem to have gotten into the wrong uinverse. also you are alive again.
Windows what are you doing now.
Programs are not actually being run properly even with the process running.
C.\windows system32\services.smc This service cannot accept control messages at this time.
How did you even do that.
Played too much new vegas I guess.
Oh and shut down my computer for 3 days.
Always a bad idea.
Guess I'll try one last thing before I reboot.
Hrrm why the hell is my torrenting speeds suddenly atrocious /.
Because boris johnson.
Granted it does tell me the port is closed on my external IP.
So that might have something to do with it.
Something is wrong when I'm downloading a 55/12 torrent at under 200kb/s |.
Or its just he laziest cloud ever.
Yeah something is fucky somewhere.
Ports are open and can be seen correctly but for some reaston qbittorrent has decided that my download speed shall not be more than 1mb/s with a bunch of downloads running.
No wait caps out at 17mib/s as a whole.
That's probably in my to do bookmarks twice now.
How couldi've I know that?
That's me shading myself.
Do what ?
Learn to pronounce korean text.
Because the characters were actually designed from day 1 to be pronounced aloud.
Rather than to represent concepts or what have you.
Its an alphabet in use that was actually designed instead of awkwardly arising from whatever culture.
Awful facebook image url incoming.
MoonWolf my aunt linked this.
Do you remember wtf the problem with the constitution was 11 years ago that had y'all and France so upset?
The contistution did a few things like expand the power of the EU but didn't do anything to curb its bullshit red tape indirected election ways.
Technically those votes were not ignored rather they just redid the same rules in a different apraoch that didn't let anyone referendum it awayu.
Also i'd like to make a big point about that whole ... thing of that table.
There is a very big difference between those votes.
And what the UK just did.
I was just curious.
I mean technically this is non binding.
But uhm yeah good luck actually not going through with it.
Unless you have a nice scapegoat like the Scots blocking it.
But i do believe that the Tories would rather leave the EU and stay in power than not leave get eviscerated politcally and the have UKIP win an election.
So I'm watching the exceedingly gay vampire romance supernatural tv series thing Carmilla.
No exalted tonight.
Steel-Fisted Beacon's debut will have to wait another week.
Steel fisted but solar hero.
Why not gold fisted ?
Also it's uh.
Either Shining Terror Style or Shining Hero Style in Autochthonia.
Depending on who you ask.
Shining Finger style ?
I think that's a different thing =P.
Though it would canonically work with Piston-Driven Megaton Hammer.
Shining piston finger style.
Here I am.
Rank 14 in standard.
Playing against secret paladin.
In standard ?
Can you double check that for me.
Also ft. C'thun.
I could sort of see a mass sercret yogg paladin.
Because those are cheap and yogg fuel.
I don't have any wild decks incidentally.
You can queue a standard deck into wild if you want.
Anyway enemy won.
Because I'm using my freeze deck to accomplish the spells daily.
GlennCuttlefish what time is good for tomorrow? and place?
Dunno. What exactly was your initial plan?
Beer or something.
Ok. for how many hours day or evening how are you traveling and from where.
We are probably driving over early afternoon.
Kicked from FF guild today.
MairBear a shame.
Ok so no getting farschnickled if one of you is driving and early. I dont even know of any decent places in Helsinki that are open before 6PM.
Well any pubs that is.
Tikkurila has a pub can you get to there easily?
If its a problem we can pick you up.
About as easily as to helsinki witht he added bonus that its cheaper than going to helsinki.
So what time do you want to meet up.
Whatever that maens.
I should be easy enough to spot short and morbidly obese with long hair.
In fact I have a picture from midsummers somewhere here..Just a second.
Think I saw that picture on FB.
Potentially with a limp.
Oh almost certainly with a limp my foot looked like a potato today that is usually an overture to hobbling around.
Well if you saw it on FB no reason to spread my shame around.
Ok well that just means I gave to show it to my friends who are reading over my shoulder p.
Everyone saw it on FB.
Probably Edi's fault.
No facebook yay.
Well do you want to see it.
GlennCuttlefish beautiful proper midsummer.
I've seen other pictures.
Yes but unlike the other picture I didn't entirely hate this one.
I have clearly missed something.
Why do you have flowers in your hair.
Such pretty flowers.
You didn't answer my question btw anathema around what time are we meeting?
Sorry we are discussing.
MairBear MoonWolf.
She proceeded to Frostbolt my Alex.
Noelor nice mirror.
Well not exactly mirror.
We both amazing'd each other for a couple turns leading up to that.
Anathema I should be able to get there in time. I'll leave a message in IRC if I cant.
Anyway that's that quest done.
Enough gold for an arena I'm still trying to fish out a *5g reward -.
Have you got like a trailing 5g on your acc that's tilting your OCD or something?
The last couple days has been me 'terrorising' casual with vaguely rational constructed decks with non-basic cards.
Being a smidgeon off the next ranked tier and not wanting to risk a loss streak doing dailies and the TB not a great one.
I'm sure you were the scourge of rank 18.
16 actually and I said it wasn't on ladder. So whatever resultant MMR I've racked up.
It probably looks at your rank.
I'd like to pretend to disbelieve that anyone would have a GOAT MOM t-shirt available at that short notice.
But if anyone would it would be Undertale fans.
Noelor they were already there.
Just waiting for the opportunity.
No man you can totally see them wearing unrelated shirts in the first panel.
They were waiting *with spare hidden t-shirts*.
Everyone needs a hobby.
Depending on if i win or looes thigs game i'm done after this one.
Welll I'm going to watch you anyway.
Got my box.
Now this this is a great computer generated card.
Silver medal for objective time.
That was probably not a good match.
It was actually my best match of the evening.
In that it was over blessedly quick.
Sorry you are having bad games.
That last one was Volskaya right.
We lose the first point.
So my entire team rushes off to the first point after spawning.
A what now?
A Gruntamulous Dindergrabble.
Dingergrabble sounds like an extremely English word for a penis.
Ftrbzzs just taking the opportunity to talk over irc p.
That chocolate was very good.
The basic milk chocolate one?
Right I'm off.
Or...maybe not. seems my next bus goes in 20 minutes. Should still make it in time or be only slightly late at worst.
We'll live don't worry.
MoonWolf I'm glad Steven Universe is sufficiently anime to fall within the purview of a man with the magical power of anime emulation.
I.. what ?
I'm sure this is a perfectly logical followup to something i said or saw somewhere.
On the flipside they didn't have to leave. Unlike English fans 8D.
Someone make hozer a real pokemon.
It can be grass/water.
So I'm playing new vegas with some mod that added a whole lot of new areas to the game.
I'm exploring a cave full of so far Radroaches giant rad roaches HUGE rad roaches lakelurks of all kinds and ghouls.
Of which the latest example is a giant hyper reaver ghoul.
And OWB already added giant sized versions of some monsters.
At least its just rad roaches and not something actually dangerous like Mega Cazadors.
Well this place is going to be a pain in the ass as a melee build.
Its an apartment building full of armed ghouls.
So about 200 shotgun shells 30 stimpaks and a whole lot of ghouls later I finally killed that place.
Oh and some C4.
Good loot ?
I doubt it. decent almost certainlybut at this point I already have a super sledge.
Nearest upgrade would be in OWB.
Oh nice a power armor.
Pity it sends me over my carry weight.
Also cant use it.
I am not sure what kind of weirdo accent they are speaking english in.
MoonWolf wtf Kibler played 2 journey below... and 0 Xarils.
Wish that worked for me.
Also buy one.
Gods bless you kelly.
Ah fuck damn it. Roll20's chat logs are busted or something.
Whats wrong with them ?
On all my campaigns I should add.
On both chrome and ff.
Fellowship and fiasco seem fine.
OTS is fucked TGAO is fin.
Huh OTS was blank for me.
Might be an intermittent issue.
I mean it could be campaign length or something.
Lets hope they fix it before tomorrow evening.
But then again that doesn't really match up since TGAO has gone on for about as long as OTS.
'bout 6 months longer.
Huckster into doom. prep-doom turn 7 v zoolock for 7-draw.
Thats a lot of draw.
Too bad they then soulfired out their nzoth 'win condition'.
It seemed so safe!
Sweet overbrawl for the week is PharahxMercy.
All about the PharMercy.
While I do enjoy new vegas I wish it stopped crashing all the time.
Wrrong engine for that.
Oh fuck off cleared half of vault 34 game crashes just before I reach zone change.
So no save for me.
Thats why you save manually a lot.
There wasn't really a good point to save what with the constant stream of ghouls in that place.
I will never understand mei's who stop to emote.
To taunt you.
Stop being gay and help.
The PharMercy is too strong.
Played DD last night.
Bard was fun I got to do all the things.
Buffing singing slashing zombies apart.
Non-combat things like boasting taking down evil boasters accidentally being racist.
Drow it turns out don't like being called elves.
You... terrible person.
I need to decide if Zheridi feels any attraction to mammals.
Its dnd probably not even going to be relevant ?
Related what would you call the opposite of a scaley anyway?
MoonWolf yeah but I want to know.
Furries probably have words figured out for this but i don't know them.
As far as i know yes.
Am I a lizard again?
2 nights of reptile lady in a row.
One with significantly more bullshit powers than a bard.
Did I tell you Gnome had switched class because he was sick of not having standard actions?
But that makes sense.
He has changed to monk.
But specifically an improved version of monk someone on SA made.
Thats fair monk is actually urgh design wise.
Also now Gnome has 15 standard actions to chooose between.
Idk what exactly the changes are.
And they're level 9.
But The Many can fly and also has a horrifically powerful 1/level AoE heal.
That seems like its custom.
1/level level 9 puts it on par with Cleric's Resurrection Occultist's Quick-Load.
Yes but see.
Those are out of combat things.
This is in combat.
I haven't seen their character sheet so.
So did roll20 manage to unfuck itself?
Lets find out.
Ok. I assume that means game is on for tonight?
Bah. after yesterday I am seriously considering spending 14e on a single bottle of beer.
Thats one expensive fucking beer.
But it was also really good. And strong.
Man it was a good idea I brought an umbrella with me when I left.
So the gaming club at the café has gone high tech they're getting RFID tags.
Well high tech for a decade ago.
Well its high tech for a bunch of people who play boardgames and MtG =p.
So should we just buy that to Smurf for Christmas or?
No monopoly is a terrible gam.
But its FF7 man!
Ok think brawl this wk is a deck full of shifter zerus.
Going by hearthhead twitters.
That'll be a get my 1 win and stop brawl.
Noelor I had Fellowship White Pages.PDF open in my PDF editor for like the past month just waiting on me to add all the bookmarks to it. I just added all the bookmarks to it just now and uploaded it to DTRPG so you can now have that thing. -Gnome.
....what did you change?
Back to level 2.
Will be a few minutes but hi hi.
I too will be a few minutes.
Fries will be done in about 3-4.
Noelor can you hear me on the mumbles ?
That said on account of nobody else being there I'm going to go get some booze real quick.
Man I got some kind of sauna beer.
Tastes like sauna.
Tar and smoke.
Kibler is rampaging up the wild ladder with nzoth and it's making my efforts look bad.
Well I mean.
You're not Kibler.
Don't know why you'd feel bad about that.
I'd play it.
Oh nice UNIEL is supposedly finally coming to steam in 2 weeks.
England the only country to be kicked out of the EU twice.
Etheral conjurer into call of the wild ow ^^.
MoonWolf I ended up replacing Private Investigator on my list with Redeemed Pirate. I hope you're happy.
Yay so far beating my all-time best arena win rate.
Sure it's 3-1 but it started 0-1 p.
I may not have that much utility but man if I can't dish out the pain.
MoonWolf I ended up replacing Private Investigator on my list with Redeemed Pirate. I hope you're happy <- i am good art is victorious.
MairBear BEST CHANGE.
So I starting playing Duelyst. Kibler's power of persuasion too strong.
It's kinda fun!
Good start to it got a nice clean feel to it.
Robocop was not an ideal to aspire to.
English politics the joke that keeps on giving.
And by giving I mean -.
Now what ?
One of the Leuve champions was Boris Johnson a man who has been aiming at leadership of the Tory party for years.
Following the result he was quick to call for Cameron's resignation which occurred.
Today he announced that he will not be running in the Tory leadership election.
Well I lasted longer than I expected less time than I hoped. Booting up overwatch now.
Enticed by competitive mode then?
Just bored of new vegas.
!note Noelor.
Oh hey a legendary box.
Keep getting 4 gold in brawl still not a single win.
Either everyone else is really terrible at farah or I'm better than I thought.
> oh cool a legendary.
> sym skin.
I got a box of money.
Which is exactly what I wanted.
This is worse than my baron geddon draw at least that one's shardable.
Junkrat/Tracer is sort of cute.
Nice one card away from the second level of the summer badge. Without spending a nickle.
BOOSHING CONFIRMED FOR XCOM2.
MoonWolf given I'm only one book in I'm assuming before clicking this link both buttons are identical.
Noelor They are in fact identical.
I'm glad that WIR concept art includes the logo of a pornhub sendup.
On defense my team is genji pharah tracer and 2 trollbjorns.
This is not a great team.
Depends on how troll the bjorns are.
And how good the enemy team is.
Both were relatively bad.
Oh fuck off game.
4 golds and not even a card.
Oooh the xcom2 robots have customisation options for heads and props and stuff.
I should hope so!
Getting so outplayed here. oh that's def freezing explosive.
Okay that's second explosive freezing.
So close to ranking up too...
So I decided to try to learn to play the flute again.
Discovered the fingering is easy enough but I have nooo capacity to reach the high notes any more.
I just can't blow properly MoonWolf.
I'm so sorry.
I am learning to play the start menu theme from Undertale.
Because it specifically uses two notes that have the same fingering with different airflow.
Ie the same note but an octave apart.
S how does that work.
Dunno if it works on reed instruments.
Like my clarinet had valves for octave shifting but I'm not sure if you meant that.
But with your mouth.
Not a valve.
Man am I fucking glad I flummoxed at playing a flute in Williams all those yrs ago then.
It is a pain in the tits.
Because there are so many ways to get it wrong.
Including a way I'm managing rn where both notes come out?
Claim is advanced technique.
And its high skill.
Ok I'm going to pin up two tunes as goals for july.
Start Menu and Zelda's Lullaby.
The latter of which I can play if you ignore the bit in the 6th bar or so where two notes are obviously an octave too low.
Also I don't mean the whole thing just the famous bit at the start.
Don't expect a duet. The ligature on mine's still bust from ten years ago.
Zelda's Lullaby doesn't really suit a clarinet anyway imo.
The opening bit of Megalovania is actually really easy I am trying none of the rest of it.
Those bits are fit for a flute ?
Just the very opening bit that's like dadah dah dah daaah daaah dadadah.
Anyway I kept browsing through this google search.
I've found sheet music for Oh! True Love! and it is wrong.
So now I'm trying to correct it by ear.
And the loss streak continues. Apparently reno cthun mage is a thing.
Hey MairBear want to do the weekly brawl in getting angry at videogames?
Give me a few mins to finish this levelling roulette.
15 mins or so I'd guess.
I'll play a quick game meanwhile then.
Spend 3 minutes in queue for this brawl.
Now entering temple of anubis.
Not enough players back into queue.
Oh boy golden blessing of wisdom...
Brawl opponent drops ETC. get the 4dmg spell card. Plus ping. Hmm now I know how all my opponents always felt.
Shadow word horror killed a lorewalker cho. his last act was to pass a copy to me.
Shine on you moonlight stallion.
Well the final brawl for a 5 win quest ended up as jaraxxus facing jaraxxus.
My jaraxxus won ^^.
I'm too twink for this crap.
Oh dear. I'm feeling too lazy to buy beer.
Thats pretty darn lazy.
Well then.
>order pizza for collection.
>within a minute starts absolutely pissing it down outside.
Noelor well you do live in england.
That might actually be hail...
>notice a legendary in brawl pack.
Oh hey i've got one of those.
Still haven't had the heart to dust it yet.
My opponent just MC Tech'd my Darnassus Aspirant =D.
That was probably not the intended target.
Probably would have preferred my Ironbark yes.
I had one of those aspirants. Swiftly dusted.
BwaS its a good card.
You should've kept it.
Kinda prefer the insurance of a wild growth as a 2.
You play all 4.
If you're ramping.
GlennCuttlefish game actually exists tonight!
Yes yes sorry.
Cooking took 5 minutes longer than expected.
> wild turn 1.
> shields up red alert.
Time to raise my concede apm.
Twice in these games an ethereal conjurer found me a pyroblast for exact lethal ^^.
This is so weird and somewhat depressing.
I dressed as an egg for Halloween and met a guy dressed as a chicken. After a few drinks and some schmoozing we got around to answering the age old question. It was the chicken.
Noelor.
Arena at 3-2 and I think my opponent is afk/dc'd from turn 0.
Okay maybe not now.
Also I assume it's just an optical illusion on that picture but it looks like the torso is barrelshaped?
This bullshit shaman deck just went 5-2.
MairBear it's because of the overlapping they're doing.
Lock who literally drafted zoo only just beat them as they went into fatigue.
Okay 5-2 it is then.
An activated 9-9 drakonid is really difficult to deal with in arena.
120g plus a pack. Not bad.
MoonWolf TIL do not use Herald Volazj on a shadow-madnessed unit.
Unless you want that 1 extra damage and have a way to kill it off.
Good to know.
Kripp just gave his enemy mage a 1/1 sorcs apprtice.
Not a 1/1.
It was more the fact that he got to play 4 spells that round and still have mana to ping.
I suspect clearing the main dungeon of this mod that adds whole bunch of locations made me a bit overleveled.
Killed a cazador with my bare hands.
Fuck cazadors anyway.
Fuck that dungeon tho. I only managed to clear it by getting a grenade launcher and spamming chokepoints.
You'll end up being overleveled anyway after a while depending on how you pace yourself.
I mean I ended up at max level somewhere around or before doing OWB.
Granted I think I did waste one of my perk slots on a bonus xp perk early on so that might have done something.
Cooked_Auto did you say you'd found a way to filter tags out of the Steam Discovery queue?
No they added that now.
Just go into the exploration queue part and you'll see it.
Its called large pile of wood ?
Talking of robots.
Have a video essay written by a neural net.
Noelor the performance is actually much more impressive than the writing.
The books are the rest of history but reasonized.
!hs Sacred Trial.
Note Plays not Summons.
This is actually preferable.
Because it doesn't hit a stupid 1/1 or something.
Ignored ghost wolves.
Hit 10/10 Frostwolf Warlord.
MoonWolf ty for help last night.
My Anyfin deck is now actually such and v fun.
The latest Calculator Unboxing.
Oh yeah its amazing.
This fuckin' bug.
That evolves into a subway car then the Vic Viper.
Also this coming gen's not-pikachu is a hedgehog.
Okay pokemon team.
Maybe stop with the electric rodent or rodent-ish pokemon.
We get it.
Pikachu is popular.
But please stop.
Gotta go fast.
Am in UK again.
Noelor I'm reading a book about a dimension hopping Librarian that can use a magic called The Language to fuck with reality.
I am so behind on my HS quests C.
Wonder if I can bang any out in 17 mins.
Not the only thing you can bang out in 17 mins.
I got one gavme done but that was it c.
< OW fans.
Hoping to ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ ride the funny on the RAE I spring Meiko pass honey jam thanks for the translation twitter.
The fuck did i just read.
But yes that's great.
SunTiger I hope bad machine translation.
I'm assuming that Meiko is some japanese nickname for Mei.
No clue on th erest.
And it's more likely that the translater's not been able to work out where to break words and assumed Meiko's a name rather than Mei.
Oh boy oh boy I hope todays game is cancelled.
6 hours of sleep and a hangover this will be fun if it isn't.
Its mostly the 6 hours of sleep that bothers me. Goddamnit its too warm to sleep.
Odd. feels warmer.
I'd blame the wind but there barely is any.
At least its not stupidly hot like yesterday.
<- cops greeting olympic travelers in rio.
Bleh. tongue feels like wool. Time to fix this with rhubarb pie.
8/10 for Tharjabug.
Gold objective time as Torbjorn D.
That doesn't count.
Fine internet! Be that way! I won't play OW!
Well that was a round. 5 gold.
Average day in Finland.
<- I didn't know I wanted this but here we are.
I Must Leave.
Probably for the better.
Well thats one movie I cant see.
Afaik there are still no IMAX theaters in finland.
GlennCuttlefish thats suprising.
Is IMAX for 3d movies only or also for 2d?
IMAX isn't 3D movie really.
Ok is it just the design of the theatre? shapes and sounds?
100% of IMAX I've seen was 3D.
But sample of 1.
I can't watch any 3d movies so just wondering if IMAX is an experience to look forward to or not.
Granted my IMAX exposure is kind of limited as well.
Its traditional 2d film up until recently just projected on a dome thing from what I've understood.
There is an IMAX theater in Glasgow so I'm sure Ana can take you there some day =P.
Ayy! next holiday destination anathema?
He says yes.
I can imagine experiencing the same as anathema did this week - Arrive in a part of the world where you don't understand a word people are saying.
And then drink lots of beer.
If you fail to understand people in scotland I suspect you need more beer.
At some point they have to start making sense.
Everyone needs to drink an equal amount so that it doesn't matter whether you understand or not.
For about those two seconds before you realize you've drunk to much and things suddenly get black and you wake up... somewhere.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
This is why you always bring someone who can drink more than you and can drag you home.
Like this one time in a vodka bar in NYC.
It did not end well for me.
I've only been to glasgow imax once when I was like 12. But sure p.
2-1 on arena. Opponent has managed to draft a literal ladder control n'zoth paladin deck.
Double keeper of uldaman plus the deathrattles.
Wheee! logged in 14 days 10 hours ago <- okay hexchat i know thats not the last noelor tlaked under that nick i can see a line from like 10 hours ago.
I think my hexchat is drunk.
That's the thing Tracer says.
Oh right when you dash a lot.
Almost caught up on emails.
Could everybody please check they have specified their name in the their GitHub profiles please pictures are also helpful? It would make things a lot easier for me and others managing the account. Most usernames in our organisation are fairly close to peoples real names but some are really not.
>picture of users including me.
ProfessionalNihilist + cartoon avatar.
Anathema who was this?
Oh damn son we upgraded to .net 4.6 while I was away.
We finally get the new 64-bit JIT!
Bitjit could be a pokémon name.
I think the telephone is louder now.
I bet .net 4.6 did that too.
Anathema you think it's louder after the blissful silence you enjoyed last week.
Popcorn used to take TWO shots to knock over. Now its only one?
Classic fucking blizzard. Sneaking in a nerf without putting it in the patch notes.
Blizz nerfed popcorn ?
This is bullshit.
No SunTiger.
This is bullshit.
That is so much bullshit.
Scientists are working on duplicating Eldar wraithbone.
Do you need to sing to it too ?
SunTiger that was a match...
Playing as dragon priest spent 12 turns with no dragon in my hand vs a cthun mage. WHo was just every card with Cthun in it + 6-8 drop minions + polymorph and pyroblast.
They lost cos I didn't get dragons.
Which meant I did get all my control and removal cards.
Still frustrating to play.
I just lost to maly hunter.
Get one tick on arcane shot and mastiff.
Oh look 26 damage for 0 mana.
Ftrbzzs Nigel is leaving apparantly.
Anathema from Fintrade/AQ team?
Shame but not a surprise.
So here I was thinking I would have a stressless morning just a few hours without anger before I inevitably boot up overwatch at some point.
And then my tablet drivers stop working again.
Well the drivers actually work none of the programs just recognize them.
If you didn't see it.
This will help.
GlennCuttlefish how are tablets so terrible.
Though seriously I am sorry to hear that /.
No this is not helping.
I swear to gods the thing I hate most about windows is that while rebooting would solve 90% of the problems in this there are next to no ways to fix things without doing so.
Fuck it. booting this piece of shit again.
SunTiger or MairBear want to help me troubleshoot something in overwatch?
Trying to figure out why my mic isn't working ingame.
So no actual gameplay required.
GlennCuttlefish just lemme know what i need to do.
Just join my party I'll see if I can get it to work first in menus then I'll set up a custom game to see if it still works there.
You might also have to join the channel not sure.
Right anything else I have to troubleshoot while at it...
Nope cant think of anything that doesn't require replacement parts.
I also need to assess how well my OW likes my Mic.
I can hop on for that.
Sorry was watching a thing fullscreen.
That person apparantly ships Symmetra/Junkrat.
Which is a weird ship imho.
Shipping in general is weird.
Ana is clearly jealous because he's never been shipped with anyone P.
I doubt this.
Gay bomb field testing that's all.
<- this is great every part of this is great. i love it.
Wait where did gary come from?
Same place as the kodo heart.
So many box meka.
Starting to get the hang of this annoying piece of shit class.
20 kill streak on tracer.
John mo'fucking Cena.
I’ll get out in front and say I fucking hate this game. ooh this LP will be promising.
Enemy's Sneed Shredder.
Into Deathwing Dragonlord.
TDI's LP of Parasite Eve 3rd Birthday.
By the way this game heavily features time travel. Just a heads up for what kind of a narrative clusterfuck we’ll be wading into here. Oh boy.
If you are wondering why Aya is wearing jeans that look like they were shredded by an unruly dog the answer is This is what happens when you take excess belts and zippers away from Tetsuya Nomura.
In subsequent playthroughs you can just skip past the tutorial. Which is nice. Except for the fact you’re replaying The 3rd Birthday in the first place. I'm three updates in and I can already see why this game is awful.
Noelor> on the Emperor BRD level took Sneed from a Museum Curator.
Got to the end of the round wanted to find out who was in it.
Deathed it to find Ragnaros.
Prompting Emperor to respond.
Auriel feels like the oddest choice to add to HOTS.
Jesus F Christ on a pogostick Aya you get to travel back in time and Quantum Break people and kill monsters lighten the fuck up a little.
Thank you tumblr.
Might as well relink this in a proper version.
SunTiger Sister III.
!note Noelor.
I like it.
Very judge dredd-ish even.
Arbites has always been a not too subtle nod at AD2000 and Judge Dredd.
Those infantry models are old. I mean really old metal models from around 3rd ed.
Mairnai the breed of dog is weird cat ?
I mean Miller does put forward why he wanted to do a BW version p.
Because to some artsy fartsy types it probs looks better.
Then they make money from ppl who can't just pass the dvd through a filter on their media player.
We play this game in another language it saves 5 seconds. SPEEDRUNS.
I liked the part where they find the frigate tutorial in metroid prime so hard they have to wallhack out of it and clip their way to the activation point.
This gives me hope that there really will be a silent film black and white version of deadpool.
GlennCuttlefish doesn't work silent i think.
The why the red suit gag falls a bit flat.
MoonWolf would have been better.
Hmm got 5 career bests as lucio on the overbrawl first round p.
MairBear lemme know when you plan to win some games of HS.
This week. ish.
There is a buttload of people in the office today I've never seen before.
Dun dun asked boss and he said it's a meeting that may have worrying consequences for us.
Hope it goes okay.
I'll try to avoid situations in the future.
That isn't wrong at all.
I've done that.
Gotta maximise the HND coefficiency.
I just love how they draw Reaper.
The edinburgh team are annoying.
MoonWolf want me to win a game?
Also i was like yeah ill watch agdq and maybe go up the ladder a bit i'm like 1 win from rank 14.
I've played like 40 games. I'm still rnak 15.
This is my winrate.
Right match over.
The weirdest shipping.
A cat is fine too.
But.... why the death ice punch?
And other questions.
He wasn't kawaii enough.
Or wanted to touch her p...Cat.
Wait no game today?
No game today.
THE SUPPORT SNIPER IS REAL.
MairBear its a healing sniper rifle.
More perplexed by the added expletive xD.
I didn't think it was real.
There is going to be so much widowmaker shipping.
Also I like how Torbjorn's like And before Mercy says anything this is definitely not going to be used for healing!
I'm good at this.
Yeah you are.
Dob's becoming a Reaper.
Dob Walks Among You.
Don't suppose either of the M-mammals feels like winning a game of hearthstone tonight?
Well it is tavern brawl night.
MairBear fucking terrible match in every way.
Well other than the fact you won.
Who plans for reno assinate c'thun rogue ?
With yogg probably.
Yogg would have made more sense in that deck.
Plenty of spells being used.
Got confused at only getting 35 dust because how could I have a new common in classic?
Oh hey I hadn't noticed before.
Even this card's flavour text thinks it's useless.
It'd be good.
In any other class.
But not warlock.
The great HS joke card.
This is Hearthstone.
We're *all* joke cards here.
Ended up making some complicated salad today.
Including fried goat cheese and strawberries.
Ugh strawberries in salad.
Oh look my first brawl opponent brings regular cthun warrior.
Fuck off prick.
~MoonWolf ugh strawberries in salad - My mom and my brother likes this weird meat and strawberry salad they have occasionally.
Once again ugh.
I dunno don't eat it so.
And oh look this priest has come with wallet cthun deck as well.
Fuck off prick.
Okay got my pack with a bullshit reno rogue with only 1 6-drop.
But took a basic paladin opponent to get it. Not sure how I feel about this.
Ugh somehow my astral communion deck is to slow.
8 games no wins.
Annnnd it's a 40 dust pack. Well 3 of the 4 commons I actually didn't have/only had a single of but still...
And then i won a match against a hunter on turn 2.
Well how bullshit were your t1/2 playz?
WELL THIS IS A THING.
Well pro cycling you know. Gotta reduce the drag.
MoonWolf usually its ugh.
But its great for balancing out the goat cheese.
Even with the tavern brawl priests fail to construct decks and rely on you to build decks for them.
Vs tempo mage spent multiple turns stalling out my attack as they kept me from having the right cheap minion down to test face for vaporise.
Finally in a position to do so.
Noelor ʸᵃᵃᵃᵃᵃʸ⋅⋅⋅⋅.
One surgery later.
Oh god that pillow is great.
Well the internet is incapable of having angstless romance.
“Customers who bought Uni Kuru Toga High Quality Pencil Lead also bought ... Durex Thin Feel Condoms Pack of 24”.
While that may be true i don't think there is an actual relationship there amazon.
Could you please schedule a call to discuss D D D.
Anathema call to discuss..?
Ftrbzzs changes to the front-end that edinburgh want.
Anathema good luck.
Remember to ask then how's it living in northern England.
Anathema has your team ever been up in Edinburgh to meet up with the other team?
Its OK the thing I'd been doing without talking to them turned out to be exactly what they are after.
And no but we did meet some of them during the christmas party.
Well Pete was up recently but I've not been.
You think you might be visiting them now that you work with them more?
Or sounds like you do.
Ftrbzzs i think work with mostly involves ana getting code he hates and requests he thinks are dumb in his lap.
Sounds about right.
They are the most involved in the process and they use lots of bits of the framework in weird non-intended ways so they end up asking for things to help them that no-one else will ever use.
I need more coffee ftrbzzs please advise.
Anathema coffee beans?
I have none in the office.
Anathema I would recommend the Kenyan coffees from Small Batch their Colombians are good too.
Fast as in 'today' ? p.
More like the next day if you order before 11am -.
In real emergencies I will allow the Tesco special Kenyan coffee.
Anathema it's the one we've had before in emergencies.
I don't know if thats expensive for coffee.
I don't think so ?
The Tesco one? no.
Small Batch one? can be depending on the lot they buy.
I had a drink from the machine at work.
It is vile.
Just learn to drink shitty instant coffee and stop worrying.
We had a visitor today in the office and they started a conversation about the coffee machine my colleague said 'ask ftrbzzs if you need good coffee'.
GlennCuttlefish there is a difference between being able to drink it and enjoying it p.
GlennCuttlefish there _is_ actually a very interesting instant coffee startup atm founded by a Finn.
Too bad it's still very expensive per cup.
Turning to instant coffee out of desperation? Please I started drinking it out of lazyness.
Just drink tea.
Cheap tea is much better than cheap coffee.
Because coffee press was just too much work.
More of the same.
Ftrbzzs the fuck.
GlennCuttlefish we have about 7 manual coffee making methods at home currently -D.
MoonWolf delicious instant coffee? maybe yes maybe no?
Not worth the price.
I met the guy in Helsinki in a coffee making championship really great guy but he did also say it's still a bit too expensive.
Hope to get the price down soon.
Holy fuck I could just steal my parents espresso machine and become a millionaire?
I'm too lazy to brew a proper cup for myself let alone other people.
My espresso machine hasn't made me a millionaire yet..
Back to finding millionairing plans that require 0 effort.
More like taking all my money out of my account.
Ftrbzzs you must be doing it wrong.
MoonWolf I know right.
Maybe I don't post enough artsy photos on instagram about making coffee.
Actually I brew decent coffee for other people. Well from what I have anyway.
You have to learn the art of drawing cats in your coffee.
Guess my problem is that I don't do any latte art because I can't drink milk based drinks.
I prefer it black.
Just photoshop some in.
I guess I can spare some work time to GIMP some cats in coffee.
Ftrbzzs instagram is already 50% food and beverage images i don't think you adding or not adding any will chang anything.
Butts and cats too.
And even some butts from cats.
I am defeated by a checkbox.
Anathema i'm disapointed in you.
So am I.
Anathema I can imagine a fierce battle.
The best reinhardt charge i'll see in my life.
Even in air F O E.
I have found the problem another event was stealing my event.
How dare they!
Anathema greedy events are the worst.
And hard to find.
Because brwosers are just great.
I'm fucken perplexed though because it works the first time you click.
But then the binding is severed and the checkbox handler recieves no more events...
Is something unbinding it by just overwriting it badly ?
Nope because I can manually change the observable in the model through the console and see the UI update.
I fixed it now something to do with event bubbling.
<- fucking Their Story is popular enough to have cosplaying fan movies apparantly.
They're not very okay with queer people there.
Noelor game on this week?
Pretty sure this game conspires to only show replays of my deaths and call them potgs.
Two bastions on 66 defence who never swapped out just a constant feed for opposition widow genji tracker.
Man this matchmaker is worse than HotS.
Triple prestige and a L83 on red.
Tripple the fuck.
You'd have to play basically nothing but overwatch since launch.
And play a lot.
To get that.
I meant 3 of them not one x3.
MairBear currently no plan to cancel.
BwaS I told you by sending you a new key!
That is a pretty good way of informing people.
ʸᵃᵃᵃᵃᵃʸ⋅⋅⋅⋅ <- pretty sure none of these characters are displaying properly in this font.
Looks okay to me.
Its just yaaaay.... in smaller script.
This font doesn't do superscript then I guess.
I see the superscript.
Blizzard developers are set to host a Comic-Con panel on the 21st July entitled Behind The Scenes of Overwatch's Newest Hero.
I love roborosewater cards.
Aw yeah latest PoMo has Tambourine Guy.
MoonWolf What a useful card!
MairBear it even gets you more of it.
Its so good.
And only 3 mana.
Shuffle your deck.
I mean depending on how many look at the top X card...
Cremations... they make my blood boil GlennCuttlefish MoonWolf.
The 3rd Birthday shipped with a glitch where the Berserker cannon’s damage persists even while the game is paused like it was fucking Mega Man 1. So if we just damage the Reaper pause and walk away for three minutes. Boom. Instant boss death. This shouldn't be a glitch this should be a FEATURE after how terrible the final boss is.
You know how the LP Thread has a no spoiler policy for this shitty disjointed mess of a game? It was for what’s coming up – the end. It’s the worst most insultingly stupid ending of any of the games I have LPed over the years and will retroactively make this already weird creepy fucking video game somehow even worse. It's that bad. And there is a LOT to the ending. About a.
Quarter of the game's total cutscene time is waiting ahead here at 90% completion mark of the game. Oh boy.
Thats one hell of a statement for TDI.
Well this game has a varied map pool.
Nope it's always hanamura offence that never gets past pt A.
And these people attended a WEDDING dressed like that.
Because all the art assets went to making destroyable costumes for Aya they couldn't be arsed making new ones for anyone else.
*reaches the end of the T3B plot* I... just... what. the. fuck?
Oh look america is a garbagefire again.
Hair not on fire but has a peg leg 9/10.
Noelor the best part of tambourine guy in videos is how he shows up.
<- well tis is a tumblr that exists.
Ive tried browsing that page before for stuff. Fucking impossible.
My browser history is full of weird and incredibly smutty archive of our own pages now.
I'm not sure it was.
Not sure how you managed that.
I went to that page and got curious wtf stories they were even using those tags for so i read the summaries.
So for instance you think wtf is Period-Typical Space Marijuana even for.
And then you end up with kinky gay starwars force awakens stories.
Because ofcourse you do.
I should have known.
Why did i even click the source link.
Becasue you're curious?
Disproportionate amounts of forests led to a 30k word post apoycalyptic/ww3 alexander hamilton fix also gay.
Man I need to get creative with my own tags in the future.
Holy unreliable narrator Batman.
Its not about batman at all is it.
No idea no source given.
The pronification of Lockean Theory This is not what those sheep died for fantastic.
Sad part the source had good tag that they missed out on My sexuality is George Washington's Southern drawl.
I'm sorry for that author not a lot of that going around these days.
Welp that stung.
Its self inflicted.
So imgur rolled out a beta.
Good thing it didn't break my custom style so all the annoying bits are still hidden.
My phone doesn't seem to be able to handle the AR feature of pokemon go.
I was just cursing along the same lines #elsewhere.
Well to be more specific not even the OS on my phone is supported.
Noelor is fellowship on for today?
I believe so.
And the Pokemon Go craze has gripped the town.
It must be exhausting being so unenthusiastic about absolutely everything.
That was an observation you idiot.
Fucking hell I even joked with my brother earlier about one of his pokemon getting knocked out of a gym position by one of the guys I know at the cafe. I even had a good laugh about the fact that it was him.
Or am I not suddenly be allowed to be amused by the amount of team plotting that is going on between the people at the FLGS over the various gym positions in town?
Holy eff is it hot out there.
Good fire pokemon catching weather.
Or go by the shore and grab some water types.
I'm not getting it until I can get that widget.
That widget ?
In other news saw the Dune movie last night. It was certainly a movie.
Work of art.
Certainly is a Lynch movie with all that whispery internal monologing to establish things that you previously saw happening.
And even then it was the whispering that annoyed me more than the monologues.
The visuals themselves are actually pretty stunning at places.
Cat defeated by saussage.
This is amazing.
MoonWolf shit seems broke.
Mumble I mean.
I think its my mumble somehow.
The audio wizard isn't giving me my own sound either.
I'm just hanging up laundry for a few more minutes.
MoonWolf GlennCuddlefish.
I am really starting to wonder if the local Uni isn't going to outright ban that game once the new term starts.
I hope not.
Let people catch their damn 'mons.
I hate everything.
Noelor 32 Lampooning Devotion.
Mei is in fact bae.
Behold 82 Feather Hammer Crushes the Tongues of the Holy.
< sgt hammer in heroes. All the time.
BwaS really don't know why they didn't make the tank an actual tank in heroes.
Siege tank has a prettty long range.
I choose to interpret this as Phara's mom does not apreciate puns.
How do you not know emp off the top of your head?
I'd like to win one game today.
= know dat feel.
This thread so far.
Diglet the water type.
What's up with Steam rn?
Seems like it's updating every day.
They are mostly pushing 3d game updates.
Because thats popular.
3D = VR?
I have now seen the greatest POTG ever.
In which a zaria walks down a street.
Shields a genji running by.
And nothing else happens.
Together they are strong.
Did she get an offscreen assist for someone she damage just before the POTG ?
MoonWolf just lost to a zoolock as freeze mage.
Was never going to win but goddamn did I make it take as long as possible.
Made it to turn 8!
No she was ranning from spawn.
My only explanation is that the genji would have died to widows DoT otherwise.
TIL Forbidden Healing exists.
That was an annoying response to Alex.
Still costs most of a turn an dyou have an 8/8 on board.
I don't get it.
Neither do I tbh because there was barely any context but it looks amusing.
Ahh typing of the dead.
Yet so brilliant.
Goddamnit how is it my teams are always full of people who got kicked off the short bus for being too dumb.
I dunno glenn you're at... 470/887 better rate than me.
BwaS GlennCuttlefish puts the team on his back.
Maybe the past year of HotS has made me fire retardant and I can flame back as well as I get it.
Oh man mic drop flame mail from a night elf hunter bitter he's getting undercut in market competition.
Been a long while since I got one of those.
I thought the days of AH drama were long past.
Well not for this L94 it isn't.
Also from the lesser server that's bunking with us so expected.
I am confused by this anime school uniform.
They like their students out on the move hence the stout boots.
Clearly to promote health and activity.
I'm unsure why it includes a cat.
That seems like a very inconvenient uniform piece.
I survivied another 12k ocr.
I did get the worse runner injury though.
And I got leeched.
/almost/ had to be rescued as my leg cramped up just after jumping in a pond at one point but I was OK.
Did the slackline so fast people were commenting on how impressive it was.
And now you're going to smell like muddy water for the rest of the weekend ?
Just had a hot shower think I no-longer smell of pond.
It was very pronounced in the car home.
Since there was 3 of us.
I wish there was a proper beach at our summer cabin.
I could actually spend time there then.
*Stepping on the beach plays in the background*.
I'm sure its lovely anyway.
The scenery is lovely.
A meter of mud less so.
Actually scenery could be better as well since its tiny for a lake.
How can 5 people not push a cart against 3 people.
Intimidation and direct hero matchups?
Ah the inconsistency of dva mech bomb los.
When Queen Elizabeth visited the set of Game of Thrones she refused to sit on the Iron Throne because there is a law disallowing her from sitting on a foreign throne.
So today we had some relatives over. A discussion went somewhere on the lines of mornings when you are not feeling anxious or depressed its probably not worth getting up -yeah because you'll be dead.
And then we laughed.
Goddamn this anime protagonist is dumber than my OW teams.
So what do you do if somebody is trying to bury you alive.
1 just get up and walk away.
2 shuffle around so the dirt is always under you.
3 Snivel and let it cover you.
2 sounds sufficiently anime.
Nepal. 2-0 win. Red gets 3 of the cards and potg to some hanzo with like 2 body shots.
The exact time stamp of that potg? my graviton that caught like 4.
3 would have been the right answer.
Love the 3edgy5me kids who elope around profanity filters.
Tihs is a thing.
Yess local GW guy sold me a model they were only supposed to sell on the last weekend in june D.
Legion Praetor in Tartaros Terminator Armour.
Nice the café is getting the AoS points system book ahead of release next week they should've gotten it this week but it turns out their supplier forgot to ship it to them v.
I had a flick through the generals book today it was interesting.
May pick up some AoS models after all.
Yeah I was working on a Wood Elf army ahead of that. I have like 30 old archers on the way now. Sure old monopose stuff but they're excellent count-as glade guards because that box only comes in unit of 16 and you get bonuses for units of 20.
Not to mention a fucking pain to assemble.
Holy damn this game makes my phone utterly shit itself sometimes.
Just got an Eevee though!
I heard it also devours battery life lik enothing else.
It does which is real annoying as I'm sitting here charging it and someone just put a lure on the pokéstop two streets over.
Yeah you have to keep the app running all the time for it to work.
Noelor using the AR?
Ah Pokemon GO.. I'm just about to go and take over the gym next to my office.
It will be MINE!
Also I don't have any holiday for three more weeks so I can just play if work is quiet.
I'm drinking beer and watching oitnb.
People think I'm mad already but running around chasing pokemon with my mobile might just be too much for some.
My mother already gave me the look.
Anathema and my Eevee barely missed a tram yesterday.
Aye I saw the pic D.
Didn't get the 'OH NO THE TRAM IS GOING TO RUN IT OVER' screams.
And Simon just laughed -.
I wonder how locations get chosen..
TIL what Tesco stands for.
It stands for something ?
Piscatella in latest OITNB is the best.
Rule 3 is so true.
I have in fact taken down roadhogs.
Not saying you are bad just that roadhog can pretty much instagib a mercy with a single hook.
They still need to hit it and mercy headshots still hurt.
I'm not saying i'm going to go murder roadhogs.
But it happens.
From time to time.
Finally over 2250 funbucks time to buy something.
The roadhog combo is easier to execute than kerrigan.
But whenever I'm on him feels like hook range is half that of opponent.
BwaS I feel the same with Zarya beam C.
I just exclusively alt fire.
But also red zarya 100 energy permanently.
MoonWolf so savjz yogg gang-up'd himself.
The second yogg cast mulch which gave his opponent a yogg.
And I thought my thistle into gang up gang up onto my cthun cthun 9 times in the deck stepping the active cthun to pulse again was class.
MoonWolf given the inherent bugginess that happened here too I am fairly sure this will be on a Trolden/Rageorc before the apocalypse.
So in this game 6 yoggs got thrown.
And how much actual good did any of them do ?
5 of them prologned the game xD.
6th killed the priest by casting hammer of wrath for 3 on his own face and making him overdraw for lethal.
Probably had my best bastion teammate earlier.
Liujang night market map sets up sentry on spawn-side balcony.
Goes to overtime they have tank ready still sitting up there.
Needless to say red won.
My youngest brother just burst into my room to recapture his eevee that ran away.
Pokemon Go sure is a game.
I want to play that.
Pity I cant for now.
If it makes you feel better i can't play it either.
Because my phone is dumb.
Inside sure is a game.
I have turned off the music in Go.
Because it is The Wrong Music.
Can't play FF cos server full.
Was there a big content patch ?
In today's moogle quest... three moogles have been failing to output uniform bricks. Because none of them discussed what size to aim for..
Please run around to communicate between them.
Sinze they are too lazy to get into the same room ?
No no please make a file for them so they can be less bad in future.
And thus ensure the daily repeats I guess.
I think in response to being a higher reputation with them they are less lazy now. Just incompetent.
THESE moogles mined up too many crystals... and got overcome by aether.
So I need to craft shields for their boxes so they can transport them home.
Moogles seem not good at crafting.
Not good at name a thing.
Being moogles ?
Well that's a thing.
A fine thing ?
I like Major Lapis.
The other two not so much.
Just got the dream rip-tyre drop into a graviton surge.
Got an achievement for it too ^^.
!note Noelor.
Good thing we are actually mongolians according to the internet.
Finland the magic wonderland.
Where educaction is free and alcohol is expensive.
The depressions are also free.
Yes a common thing we share with the UK.
Except in the UK there was a fancy term for winter depression.
SAD Seasonal affective disorder.
Aka 'it's fucking dark I'm depressed'.
Really you backronymed sad.
Well I had to complete this team.
Now 2 genji 2 trollbjorn 2 fiva.
Well that was a round.
3 widows in king of the hill.
Also known as fuck going around corners.
Also known as fuck we're going to lose because all these widows are bad and retarded.
Overwatch such a jolly game.
So hype.
Still no release date announced though.
Just on casual mode doing daily quests. Warlock drops river crocolisk bloodfen raptor. Not sure they quite got the right idea what 'zoo' was.
Lots of animals!
There soldier for the XCOM2 LP submitted.
Well obviously the next one is called Irwin.
Oh dear some adolescent has set his mic to always-on and it's carrying his edgy screamo music into the voice chat.
Pretty sure you can just mute them yourself.
Oh the prick got muted hard be sure of that.
Always 2 useless genjis in my team.
And one of them is you.
Dun dun duuun.
GlennCuttlefish never genji's.
If there is a genji player in this channel its MairBear.
One of them was me in the end.
When my team was me as tank a lucio and rest genji I gave up.
And then we lost somehow.
I cant figure out how.
Probably because the tank wasn't playing genji.
I don't so much get useless genjis on my team.
Definitely the widow/hanzo stacking.
Genji's hang out on red and drop the YOUJEENOKAYWAKOORAY every 5 sec and start warp-hacking about.
Oh look the 40 dust loot box of a player icon and 3 sprays.
I wish Genji wasn't so popular not cos hipster just cos 2 genjis is so bad c.
For me it's I'm bad at using him don't really know how to counter him and hearing the ult announce wreck headphones halfway across the map puts me on tilt.
Unfortunately the best counter to genji is don't get killed by him.
Knew I was doing something wrong then.
Just shoot him. either he goes into parry mode and stops attacking or died and stops attacking.
I'm just a bit of a shit aim to handle the hyper mobility.
But yeh thanks =.
Oh gods I'm so full.
So here I was figure'd I'd watch this food related anime. And as a precaution I made dinner beforehand.
I wonder where this story is going.
Turns out I prepared it too much beforehand so I finished dinner before I started the episode. Episode starts and I remember I still have the remains of 2 pies in the fridge before I have to eat before tomorrow...
He made even more- close enough.
Shogeki no soma whatsit?
Hanzo dragonstrike over the point potg. and now I feel filthy.
This web log is 100% about lemons and alpacas in anime.
What did I stumble into.
A web log about lemons in anime.
Cooked_Auto there a decent SOMA LP?
Go figure tbh.
Not really a game I'm interested in so I haven't checked.
Found one thread on Sa but it's not been updated since June 13 so.
Into the bin with it.
Found the one I was looking for.
By Mr. Odd.
Jesus fucking christ how are people playing so bad these days.
Its worse than at launch.
School summer holidays.
GlennCuttlefish you scared away all the competent folks.
Also I've been meaning to ask.
Didn't you quit?
I did for a week.
But then it pulled him back in.
My room suddenly got haunted.
Or that was a very selective power outage.
My television and lamp turned off for a second but nothing else.
Television shares outlet with my screen and computer among other things.
That's ace Noelor.
Thought you'd appreciate it.
Tonight in exalted everybody gets everybody else's pronouns wrong.
How many pronouns are there even to get wrong.
My new character is genderless.
We're inside a similarly genderless colossus right now.
The two other PCs are male and female.
We were also talking about 2-3 different cities.
All with different genders.
I like this idea that Mercy is the deadliest force.
GlennCuttlefish nice orange Reaper skin.
I've got the white mariachi one.
Unsure if Finnish or Klingon.
I am making a jest about the webm you linked.
ChaosSmurf did you play Inside in the end btw?
Please it clearly lacks the umlauts to be finnish.
Got one of the scarecrow junkrat ones today mairnai.
I am terrible at northern vowels =<.
Eastern? I can never remember the tree for Finnic.
More eastern than nordic I'd guess.
Listening to Hamilton decided to look up how they did at the Tonys.
Nominations that did not win scene design I think it's just scaffolding? lead actress not really a lead role relatively and awards they had 2-3 noms for.
Well that happened. pushed last 15 meters of numbani alone as tracer while both teams were busy battling at our spawn.
Just pushing itno opposition.
You'd thinkt he enemy team at least would try to stop you.
Well there was a trollbjorn turret there somewhere.
Fortunately I had my tracer ulti ready.
And just fyi i've gotten about 67 applications so far if i make 100 in the next day or two i'm going to start the LP but keep sign ups open.
Thats a lot of applications for a dumb lp.
Yay no internet at work today in my PC.
Not going to be a productive day then is it anathema.
Ah nuts just when I thought it wasn't going to rain it starts to rain.
Last night it rained so hard I woke up to it.
Yeah that was sunday night for me. Both some serious downpour around 40mm and thunder.
Granted I was awake when it was at its heaviest but even when I went to bed it was loud enough to almost drown out the music.
Fuck and I was planning to buy some cheap brushes on the way home too and now its fucking pouring down.
Drizzle my ass v.
Yeah that looks about right not quite clear but whatever.
Currently tethered to my phone.
And suddenly blue skies v.
Fuck it I'm just going out for a walk. I don't trust this weather one bit to stay stable.
Make sure glenn sees when he's back.
!note GlennCuttlefish.
MairBear xcom mods are great.
Implements darkest dungeon esque morale in xcom 2.
What it needed V.
Nice they've already reached their initial funding goal.
MairBear there is also a imgur post somewhere of someone who went out to catch some pokemon and came home with a dog.
Oh hey looks like I went out at a good time. Its started to pour again and there's thunder rumbling as well.
Luckily my weather is much nicer.
Pokemon go porn incoming in 3 ... 2 ... 1.
I don't think it'll be that much different from the rest of the pokemon porn out there.
Passes out you don't say.
After 36 beers. I mean if it was a good one it might have done so after like... 10.
Holocauast museum doesn't think catching pokemon in the museum is very fitting.
Cant imagine why.
Someone reportedly found a koffing there.
Well thats just poor luck.
MoonWolf Savjz playing vs a warrior.
His shades gave him shield slams.
His thoughtsteal gave him 2 more. So he is sitting on 4 of them.
And no armor.
Hehe playing cthun druid for dailies. wotog pack from gold yields 3 druid cards.
Technocratic union.jpg.
Well then the PharMercy is going to get weird now.
PharMercy can stay itself.
Just going to see a lot of WidowAmari.
Well 76xAmari could also be a thing.
Ugh god I hope these random internet outages is not going fuck with my Star Wars session tonight or else I'm going to be annoyed >_>.
HS now has... recreuit a friend.
ALL MY FRIENDS ALREADY PLAY BLIZZARD.
Why would you do this.
I need that shaman hero Cooked_Auto.
Its a murloc.
I need to have a murloc hero.
Hmm might be able to dig out the 4 smurfs I set up for the HotS RAF.
Gah that was close. Nearly ran out of steam vs a warrior because despite having lethal on board throughout he topdecked a survival plan.
For 4 turns*.
Poor red team. went for the double offence widow on anubis while I just camped as reinhardt with a bastion.
= go from a shutout defence on anubis to a full cap offence in decent time/comp/play.
3 medals to red team and the 2 kill bastion potg S.
And my s76 highlight was a melee kill on widow followed by shooting out a starting up toblerone.
I dunno man thought I had a couple sweet tac visor drops \_*_*_/.
MoonWolf recruit-a-friend in Hearthstone gives you a murloc hero replacement for Thrall.
I never manage to get murloc shaman to work.
Only ever in the top 2 brawl.
Career best dmg takedowns as pharah D.
Still lost on king's row offence though =.
But we capped pt A which is a helluva lot better than usual games on that map I guess.
Horus in an FPS you say?
That was quick.
Internet doesn't fuck around with overwatch fanart.
The first porn was out the same day the blizzcon trailer movie thing was shown.
Right time to HearthSmurf.
I wonder if the Illidan fight will stall me out for 10 attempts like the first time I played.
Gods fighting magma ragers as jaina with no hero power.
Fuck damn it got slotted into a reserve position for the Creative Writing course I applied to earlier. At place #368 too. =|.
So my smurf completed the tutorial opened the RAF pack.
> Angry Chicken.
We already had that one CA P.
MoonWolf I don't like the one hero limit they proposed on PTR.
More people are gonna treat it as an insta lock.
I find the overtime changes pretty big.
So who is Sombra D.
Mairnai does it apply only to competitive?
Less bothered then.
MoonWolf fuck you and your vocabularly.
Thought I'd beat you but we got the same score.
I'll take that as a victory.
Because i have a handicap.
So do I.
I'm Scottish p.
Not the same.
Decisions decisions bed or more whiskey.
Bed with whiskey.
These changes to D.va are interesting.
And there we go.
My totally legitimate friend who never played hearthstone before smurv.
Just reached level 20.
Is he a natural at it?
He might be.
I didn't ask smurv about gender or pronouns.
Mairnai can you win a game for me tomorrow.
I've had enough HS for now but i just got that quest when i checked if my murloc unlocked right.
MoonWolf maybe with brawl.
I actually skipped brawl last week D.
RIP my pack.
40 dust lost forever.
I got the Play a friend! quest.
That thing is exceedingly rare.
This is amazingly cocky.
So all OW needs now.
Is a Sniper Tank.
And then we won't have bad role-pick problems.
Or at least a tank with a straight fire/hitscan projectile with range greater than a yard.
Sure win as warrior should get done quickly thanks to pirates.
Currently against... taunt/c'thun/reno warrior.
Of course it's a reno deck...
OW needs a if there's sym/bas/tob on red don't spam me to say they have turret/tele up option.
Dob that exists.
It's called kill the damn turret.
Cooked_Auto you predicted it now here it is.
Oh that one is old.
Like before playable Ana was announced.
Well nvm then.
So Star Wars last night was interesting. We went from this early to this towards the end.
I hope you brought explosives.
And possible orbital bombardments.
Well tbf that last one was right before our ship came and picked us up.
After some fuckery on the ship too.
But only the Padawan NPC got wounded meanwhile my character was effective.
When my character shoots. People will die.
Penalties? No biggie.
Sniper grandma just wants everyone to take a nap.
Probably for the best.
MoonWolf I'm gonna give a win a try at HS if you're around.
Yes plz do.
I went to archive of our own and checked there is 23 stories featuring ana amari and half of them written today.
Anathema fanfiction of the new overwatch character.
I know I'm wat'ing at it existing.
I knew it was going to exist.
I'm suprised it was that much.
Weird. Come back home to find my computer shut off for some reason.
No wait. My brother turned it off because he wanted ot check the ping =|+.
And he didn't even bother to simply unplug the TP cable or shut off the router I'm hooked up too either. Nope. Just shutting my computer off without telling. And then not bothering to turn it back on.
Game still on for tonight?
That is the plan.
Hey turns out I have mumble installed on this already and internal mic pics up as well.
So here I am stuck in the middle of nowhere.
Nearest town is somewhere between 20-40 kilometes from here.
No running water.
And wifi works.
Gods bless modern life.
Wait. Samuel L Jackson explaining game of thrones? Sure.
Glenncuttlefish laptop ?
I just got home.
And need to shower + eat.
So if I'm a little late assume I'm shoveling risotto into my face.
I'll probably be a few minutes late having a quick sauna before the game.
!note anathema.
Sorry itsntaking so long windows decided to update while i was in the sauna.
I hope its not installing 10 or anything dumb.
Right ypdates done.
MairBear Graze make an Inspired by Jaffa Cake snackbox.
Can you guess what's in it?
Chocolate orange and ... sponge.
Dark chocolate buttons.
Orange raisins which I guess are raisins soaked in orange juice? they're not dried orange segments.
And roasted hazelnuts!
永春台 Terrace of Endless Spring.
Not enough teabagging.
Om nom burrito for breakfast.
Anathema am nam.
Goddamn mei puns.
I should start gettin Graze boxes again.
Last night in WHFRP we snuck into ancient Dwarven ruins almost shot the princess who snuck in before us. Then the wizard tried to cast a spell and got possessed by a demon so the rest of the session was fallout for that including him putting on the cursed demon-gauntlet we *thought* we had left buried hundreds of miles away but which he secretly had taken to study. The gauntlet that made the Bretonnion so mental we cut off his ...
... fucken arm to get he gauntlet off him.... And then the princess got stolen by skaven.
Also he miscast and spoiled all our food.
Magic not even once.
You are not very good heroes.
SunTiger this is a sidequest too the GM didn't even expect us to come here.
And I said we shouldn't but was ignored again.
Also our best fighter is covered in un-exploded skaven napalm.
Just let it dry.
I'm sure its fine.
It also glows so probably warpstone based.
We're gonna be mutants D.
A third arm can be very handy.
Did I mention our dwarven sergeant has a 93% chance to hit now?
And 3 attacks with Impact roll 2 damage dice pick the best.
He got a magic axe for handing in the gromril we found in a khemrian tomb.
And chose the +30% WS master rune.
I would too.
But there is one where you get to /throw/ your weapon like a boomerang even if it is a giant axe.
Yeah but MATH.
Oh yeah we tried to shoot the wizard to death because he flew up on top of some 18-foot tall shelves before we realized he was possessed.
But the second spell he cast was Shimmering Field which removes the base damage from ranged attacks.
Soooo we're probably gonna kill him next session or cut off his arm at least...
And then do something more permanent to the demonic gauntlet than burying it ?
SunTiger we tried to burn it that didn't work.
SunTiger it can't be cut apart we tried and did a Gimli at the council of elrond.
I have Left Behind by slipknot stuck in my head.
Its like being 15 all over again.
Yesterday it was People = Shit.
Ofcourse it iwas.
What are you implying? p.
People are already dubbing it Nana boost.
Probs calling it Stim Drone myself as it runs exactly like the Medic heroic in Heroes p.
Also they undid the damage-boost buff on mercy.
50% was just too good on ptr.
We made it actually good turns out its good when its good. so we made it bad again.
We shouldn't call this tempo mage we should call it midrange mage << erm.
Great the xcom 2 commanders guide thread has devolved into haiku.
Ennuiaboo - a username I came up against while gaming.
's a good name.
Don't pander to twitch chat panda? there's no brewmaster here.
Well thats weird and annoying. Desktop Skype has stopped updating while my Android versions work just fine for a chatroom.
Skype is terrible.
Extra terrible now for no real reason.
I havent recieved a single desktop message since 1508.
And I'm not alone on it either.
Chaps and a miniskirt.
Noelor well if you let people play dressup.
They'll.. you know.
The dressup in LR is entire outfits.
Which you get to palette swap around.
And add hats to.
Well thats much more disapointing.
Hats swords and shields.
Okay so desktop group chat works for my US and Canadian friends but not me and another Swede. Dunno wtf is going on with skype.
Its just being skype.
Yeah pretty much.
But at the same time highly frustrating.
Status NetStateConnecting.Backoff Something is wrong at least.
Meanwhile the Browser client works just fine. Fucking Skype.
Gotta love the approach to overwatch balance like the thought that 76's ult charges too fast meanwhile hanzo flings out dragons every 10 sec from doing nothing and genji gets a 1-shot easymode drop.
It still amazes me genji doesn't get gunned down the moment he pops out of cover.
Because he has the hitbox the size of a centipede and has stupid mobility?
His hitbox isn't that small.
SunTiger not gonna be here next wednesday x.
Or tuesday or Thursday.
What are you up too ?
Grandparent visits in Newcastle.
But short enough that I can't bother a Noelor c.
You can totally bother a noelor.
Just go get lunch or something.
Well the Wednesday is his birthday can't go for that and we're driving up and down on the others but could do depending on work schedules.
Fuckin' cheese comp of 76 77 78 79. Bloody premades.
Just go rein.
Glenncuttlefish do you care for any of thsoe code-based rewards other than the maid/butler code for FFXIV?
Cant remember what the others were.
Ifrit mask + 30k MGP and 30 jandelaine tokens. Titan mask with 50 aetheryte tickets and 99 fireworks.
And if you get them all then you get a silver fat chcobo.
While the chocobo is neat not really willing to pay too much for it.
More kind of asking if I should keep an eye out for guildies with spares if it happens. But considering how hard it might be to get a copy of the thing in Finland ? was just wondering if I should plan to get two of the maid one.
Oh Noelor if you're still around I will need to brb during game around dusk. Our neighbours are away and ... well... I'll be chicken sitting for them B.
If you can I'd appreciate if you grabbed a spare maid code.
I have no idea of what they are planning for nordic countries and if finland will even be included.
Apparently the magazine ships overseas but .... the overseas part is more money.
SunTiger Wingin' It Love Can Be Such A Dragon A yuri shoujo high-school dragon dating sim about a second chance at being noticed <- not so much a game as a someone who drew a bunch of art that and hopes to make a game.
!note MairBear I need to play a friend for gold.
EDF! EDF! EDF!
Cooked_Auto why is lapis in that picture.
She's just traumatized not edgy.
EDF! EDF! EDF! EDF! EDF!
Maybe it won't lag so bad on pc.
It doesn't really lag on PS4.
I saw some footage of the giant robot stages.
And those didn't look very smooth.
The FPS certainly dips wouldn#t call it laggy though I haven't played one of the giant robot levels though.
I played it last night actually with a friend.
Huh seperately purchasable mkiv armour.
All the calth stuff is now available on its own since last week.
Of course buying the calth box is still a better deal but thats good if you want to bolster your forces a little.
Can't remember how many mkiv guys calth comes with.
Thirty Legion Tactical Space Marines in MK4 armour.
Hmm might pick up another 10 guys so I can do 2*20.
If I get around to actually making them p.
As a starter the Calth box is smarter but if you want to add some Mark 4s the new separate ones are good.
I've had a calth box since...Feb.
Having a backlog is part of the hobby.
I'm waiting on like 26 old wood elf archers now.
Turns out you can field glade guard into units of 30 with the generals handbook points so scooooreee.
Yeah the generals handbook is making me interesting in AoS.
Granted then you run into the issue with them only having one general battleline unit that being glade guard. Then you have to use a specific leader to get Rangers or Sisters of the Watch as battleline.
What's really good though is that Eternal guard is not a battle line and cost 80 posts. Which I did a doubletake to.
If i drank coffee i'd get coffee there.
That is me in the morning ftrbzzs can confirm.
<- a good spray combo.
Song stuck in my head today.
Anathema you're very merry after coffee!
Maybe by Finnish standards.
By finnish standards a slight smile would've been considered merry.
Oh gods the puns.
I like this account.
Oh yeah there is some great and also weird prose in those.
Also I love TES in general because I get to pull the silliest shit in TGAO and its all fucking lore friendly.
Like the giant robot they fought last session.
Or the time they fought the Duke of Scamps.
Have they fought the most terrifying Morrowind monster?
Do you know what I am referring to?
Well they fought swarms of undead cliff racers.
What then ?
Most terrifying monster is obviously.
We've had quite a few dremora.
But no hungers.
Do the dremora talk?
Mostly they just scream about ripping out your spine and torturing your soul.
On account of they are busy invading tamriel.
We've had deadroth scamps every kind of atronach dark seducers wing twilights clannfear.
No hungers or golden saints.
There ma have been a spider deadra at some point too.
What luck ghostbusters on TB.
They are trying to ruin this for me.
Theres a commercial for the new ghostbuster.
What if its not bad ?
Then it....isnt? is this some kind of bait.
Do you hear the people sing?
Funny enough that seems to be the rumor.
Or at least an armed coup attempt or such.
Welp things are almost getting confirmed as a coup in Turkey.
Failed coup so far anyway.
Well coup attempt.
That upsets me.
That is not JadeStars LP v.
It is a new LP!
Cooked_Auto dyk who's mod these days on LP?
Fedule is one of them at least.
He also really likes Lightning Returns.
Oh no the nerve.
That guy has terrible taste.
And should hold no power over others.
JordanKai is another mod as well.
And he's doing a Nier LP.
Aw yiiiisss the first XCOM2 video is out.
Lol wat.
At least its not social eating Cooked_Auto.
Im sure that can be included somehow p.
JAIDS has already struck during a stream tonight. No telling how this will affect the LP. Welp.
Well then Star Wars Rebels season 3 seems to be a doozy.
Darth Maul huh.
Can't remember if he died for good in TCW or not.
SunTiger the final quest for the dancing owl-bird race.
Nest Side Story.
And yes they have a dance off.
What eles were they going to have.
Oh what D.
Still not actually done with them. They added an exta tier of reputation to the HW ones apparently C.
MORE DANCING BIRDS.
SunTiger 12 days more.
MairBear my condolonces.
Had the most flagrant violator in the @ReaperNames category.
Not even trying tier.
Somehow only their 2nd most played 1st handsoap.
A garbage person.
At least he seems to wash his hands regularly.
That's a pretty rational and measured response to hearing about a Vaporeon.
Bet it murdered the servers though.
But vaporeon is the worst of the three standard eeveelutions.
You take what you get.
Its not like they have to fight anyway.
Yeah but *any* Eeveelution.
Because Eevee are pretty uncommon already.
And evolves at random.
Also rn Vaporeon might be better if it gets an ice move?
Idk if it does but at least around here flying types are really common.
Are you trying to go all smogon on pokego.
Better than Flareon obvs - Jolteon is better.
BwaS no i just dislike the fish thing.
I think they should have used something else for the water type.
I'm now checking through all the pkmn I caught yesterday.
The Hypno I caught is garbage.
It's level 92 while my lowest-level Drowzee is 255.
Oh this game has some uhm.
Yeah idk if there even is a max level.
There is no hardcap afaik.
No wait that's the trainer level I think.
Pokémon max level is a function of trainer level.
So if there's no trainer level cap there's no pokémon level cap.
Apparently the soft cap according to some friends is 20 and no known hard cap.
Yeah once you hit 20 the xp requirement at least doubles every level.
Oh man a solo LP of a From game. Haven't seen those in a while.
By a while.
Do you mean since yesterday?
I don't have a 100% check on Dark Souls LPs =p.
I mean the last From game LP I saw that wasn't streamed with multiple commentator was a Demons Souls LP.
And that was one made in 2010.
You really missed Lets Talk About Dark Souls completly ?
I did watch Geops LP of DS1.
Thats about it.
Granted I didn't even finish that one v.
!note MairBear.
MoonWolf can I hearthstone you at some point today please?
Hate freezemage so much.
Stuck with a hand full of removal against a opponent with no minions and a board that can't attack.
Consider it revenge for that shaman deck the other day.
Should hav ejust brought a a control deck.
Dutch police unsure if arrested man should be considered thief or trespassing pokemon go player.
Did they steal anything?
Because that seems like the obvious point of distinction.
Man was arrested after a family called the cops they had subdued him. currently in the hospital.
Articles do no mention if anything was taken.
There is actually a not too obscure link on the pokémon go site to request removal of stops and gyms.
Shame the people who would want this service are the people least likely to go and find it.
Alex's Champion and a Bloodhoof Brave went to an ETC concert. ETC flung out merch to the front row Alex's Champion caught the Explorer's Hat to go home with.
I hope they add cosmetic items to pokemon go.
So I can dress up my pokemon in hats.
Here I am looking at cheap phones for pokemon go. Someone tell me this is a bad idea.
GlennCuttlefish that is a bad idea.
You don't like walking.
And don't you live out in the country?
I live in the fourth most populated city in Finland.
Right next to the most populous and second most populous.
Sorry I'm not sure where I got that impression.
In which case just the leg thing.
This game is fundamentally walking-based.
Cycling works too ?
GlennCuttlefish do you cycle?
Noelor only hatching you can just sit around a lure'd stop with people and make bank it seems.
Ok but you need to get lures.
Also other things ?
Legit saw like 30+ people sitting next to a bridge on Friday.
Berries potions ?
You can sit at one stop and use it every 5m.
You don't need potions if you don't do gyms.
Anathema yeah but it's better to do a circuit.
Anathema also depends how you are at catching.
I actually managed to nearly run out of balls this morning.
Well that was a round for a change.
Everyone on my team was on fire.
Got 2 team kills.
That must have been really frustrating for the other team.
Realised the hearthstone RAF was as expansive as get 4 more friends to play it for 4 classic packs/4x40 dust.
Now the grind feeling like the Heroes Vulture promotion.
Really not worth it past the portrait imho.
Unless you genuinly have some friends who wnat to play hearthstone.
Like your good friend Smurv?
MairBear yes i think smurv burned out on hearthstone in those first 3 hours though.
Smurv should have had a more relaxed pace.
Ah the good ol' double widow on payload attack calling out to push the objective.
Ok no idea what that was but had a hollywood defence where offence were 6 genji.
They did not cap A.
Turns out 6 genjis are no match for just a balanced team.
All junkrat does not work.
Was a blast.
Not enough actual frontline ?
A blast eyyy.
Would you say the comp... bombed?
BwaS fuuuck yoooou.
It's a sunny day outsiiiiide.
I caught some pokemooon.
And I'm on holiday after this week ayy!
It is sunny I did not get pokemon though.
I caught a dragonair yesterday.
Fuck google.
I got a dratini from a 10k egg not seen anything else good.
I have not had a single 10k egg.
What level are you? maybe I'm too far behind.
I got it ages ago though.
I'm lv 15..
Where are my 10k eggs?!?!?!!
What level is geoff fucken 20 by now?
The memories.
Oh god the reaper is a ghost snake here too.
So over in the netherlands here we have a very famous 4 day walking event. World famous even. That even put down a whole bunch of traffic warning signs for pokemon go players.
They all got fucking stolen.
Jfc forecast to be 29C today.
Wouldnt surprise me if its going to start raining in a couple of hours here.
+19C and sunny for us.
I can see why people would want to steal those though.
Cooked_Auto yeah but ... don't ?
Yeah here it's just grey overcast right now.
MoonWolf Well yes I get that but they are kind of nifty so I can see why people would want to.
Already too hot _.
It's kind of like Germans and Moose signs v.
Anathema needs mor ewind.
MoonWolf still get sunburn like that.
Anathema yeah after +21C and walking by the sea I'll be a bright red in 15 minutes.
MoonWolf what do you expect the result of calling .join on an empty array would be?
The weather we have now is just about perfect.
Or index out of bounds.
I hope it'll stay rain free until I'm done with lawn work at least.
Wait nm was going to complain about JS but the bug was my code too hot to think >_>.
Whats the actual result though ?
Did you know Unity can automagically import your Blender models?
No but i'm not suprised.
Unity and Blender have swapped Y and Z axis though.
So Unity applies a -90 rotation to anything it imports.
So if you forget about that and set Y to 0 your model is the wrong way around p.
I know right?
Programmers are just the WORST.
Nah I love 'em <3.
Omfg EDF 4.1 on Steam unlocks today.
New SU tomorrow?
Tonight US time.
Or are we still on the backlog of stuff France showed early?
Should be new I think.
I need to knwo what happens to those rubies.
Sure lets go with that.
Ginyu force + rubies.
Is that the wrong reference?
My DBZ knowledge is still 95% osmosis.
That 15 should be a 22.
It is now.
Today on depressing tumblr tags.
Minister getting a bit anathema there.
Well now I have to read it |.
Tumblr tags like the literal tag.
Its not evena full sentence.
Yeah but I needed to start Firefox so IT can't see me reading tumblr.
Anyway I feel mischaracterised.
You're the nihilist there.
Yeah love is a real thing since its just chemicals in your brain it's just meaningless like everything else.
What is love~.
Just chemicals in your brain.
That actually scans.
If I pronounce it chem'cals.
Hence sort of.
Or drop the just.
Synchronising UI state across components without generating infinite message loops is tricky.
Sounds like you could use a singleton.
No they are different things but I need to keep a certain flag synced.
Kirisu its twiters fault.
Did it hit with the not part of your 140 thing?
But sort of.
If an image is Embedded on the page.
They have no space after the text.
They just have a linebreak.
So no linebreak.
I can fix it.
I am not awake enough today.
At least half an hour spent on a bug because I used .forEach instead of .map and TS isn't strict enough to flag returning from a void function OR assigning the result of a void function to a variable as an error.
I dunno what a .map is/does.
But it doesn't sound like it could be replaced with a foreach.
Why is it that every time I defend in numbani theres 3 trollbjorns in my team.
I can almost understand that on the first point but.
Its always all the way.
Last point also pretty good turret ground.
In between not so much.
Fuck off game stop instancing me in mumbani defense.
I am not going to play that shit anymore.
I cant even remember when I last attacked on that map.
Oh look. volskaya.
In interesting new plan.
Companies are planning to use pokemon go to reduce the number of breakins.
There's certainly some good torb spots on numb but 3 of them not so much.
Esp if red just starts stacking the pharahs and junkrats.
Why is it so hard for people to counterpick.
They had 3 soldiers.
Who is even a soldier counterpick.
He's too damn middleground to counterpick.
Depending on how good their aim is tracer genji reaper maybe.
Reaper certainly if you are on the last stretch of route 66.
Man i wish we had 17C.
I at least hope for warmer weather tomorrow. Exercise swimming under an overcast sky is kind of boring. Would want at least some sunshine.
This can only lead to magic.
Sure why not.
This is a thing alright.
Dorado defence barrage for 3 in final half-minute. nah potg to torb turret that gets like 2 and gets pulse bombed.
They are high in calories so technically.
You could think of it as a meal.
That looks pretty good.
Reminiscent of snake wait why- ooooh I see what you did there.
>forecast over 30c today.
No thank you.
Yeah thats probably going to get close to 30 before the day is over.
Anathema that's a bit too much.
Not sure I would call it a spinoff.
Nothing bad could possibly happen in a nier quest.
Hm interesting lineup for LP videos to watch XCOM2 Dark Souls 2 Demon's Souls and then Bloodborne.
I am a bottomless void of hunger this week.
Anathema turn your volume way the fuck down and go to this site.
Maybe when I'm not at work.
I plan to buy it Wednesday.
Or next Sunday.
Yep too damn hot.
New shirt!
Ana live in overwatch.
Okay OW is a mess of your team stacking ana and throwing the match.
Yeah i'm not playing tonight.
At least when heroes gets new chars you get a 1 per team limit to stop this shenanigans.
There is a limit in competitive now.
Yeah I should do those placements for the portrait at some point.
But laddering on hero league got me well off the mode for consistent visits.
Well that reaper was on some shit.
100% kill participation.
I wish I could mod overwatch.
Just a bit.
I just want to replace enemy ana's ulti announcement sound.
Also reaper + ana is such bullshit goddamn.
I love tis comic so much.
Work bake off today.
Made the right decision not to eat breakfast.
Does the bake=ing off happen at work or just the results ?
>Moonwolf making puns.
2016 truly is the year of the apocalypse.
How was that a pun ?
You weren't making a weed joke?
The dutchman? p.
Oh man twitter finally banned milo.
Didn't ban his asshole army.
So it makes little difference.
Makes it harder for him to paint targets on people.
That photo.
There was lasagna and some kind of pie.
So sleepy now though.
I thought it was sweet stuff.
Guess i was wrong.
It is both.
Lasanga is basically a cheese ragu and pasta pie anywya.
More of a quiche I think? Not entirely sure on the definition of quiche.
Pasta stuff n sauce.
I had feta and spinach quiche last night.
<- this is why nobody takes your country seriously.
Your goverment offices are SHIT.
That must be why.
I have all that stuff already.
Try being on the insider build.
So my boss tried to run our framework up against our real work active directory.
It takes 7 minutes to sync users / groups.
Checking out the patch 7.0 changes.
The talent tree revamp to give every spec a custom kit. Leaves the frost DK pane a journey into what's a different way we can represent blue/ice/snow?
Ftrbzzs Roxy is leaving Brady.
Less drama more 'everyone is quitting'.
I thought brady was a person.
Nor a place.
Brady is the company I work for p.
Why is your ocmpany just the name of a random bloke.
The founder is called Robert Brady.
The founder lacks a last name.
Any of you nerds know if it is possible to get a pokemon from the original red/blue games up to the latest released one?
I believe so but its involved.
There's the eshop digi versions of gen 1 that will be able with sun/moon.
But the transition from gen 2 to gen 3 can't happen.
Like if you wanted kanto starters in gen 3 it was frlg or johto starters from colosseum.
So original Silver/Gold can't trade up to Ruby/Sapphire? is that gen3? I didn't play 3.
File system compatibility changes kind of thing.
The Rock is in that so obvs I'm gonna see it.
Can we tone down the heat now.
The soundtrack for WildStar is pretty fucking good.
My room is 30C and i've not felt dry since 10 am this mornign.
I was apparently playing Geek Out so hard earlier I was sweating v.
Our aircon is working for once.
We had a psycho thunderstorm this morning been rather pleasant since.
I cuold do with a good one of those.
The US army nwo has SHIVs.
It even looks SHIV like.
But SHIVs has been a thing for a long time now.
Ok I thought I had seen it all.
But now I have seen teammates who fail to kill a symmetra.
An agressive symmetra ?
I die to symmetra loads of times.
Sure but they you learn that this symmetra doesn't mind coming out to microwave you and then you shoot her.
Because agressive symmetras are only a threat if they get ignored.
They have no survivability besides a medium to small hitbox and hp.
I get that but it's usually the one popping up on my 6 activates void ray spins around boop.
Wait you can kill d.va's when they are summoning the mech?
Its infuriating as the d.va.
Thats the first time I have seen it happen.
And I have tried shooting at a lot of D.Va's when they are doing it.
They count as having the mech hp during the animation.
But they are stationary.
So two high dps shooting them is enough.
Odd. Died to only one pharah.
Pharah does have rockets.
They do hurt.
This is true.
I'd really love to see a damage breakdown of my deaths moba style.
Some of the time anyway.
Anathema so original Silver/Gold can't trade up to Ruby/Sapphire? <- this isn't strictly true btw but the trade involves buying too much outdated console to be worth it for any sane person.
Multiple consoles and link cables.
Noelor> wait doesn't it? what was the method then.
I can't even remember now.
It involves either Stadium 2 or Coliseum possibly both and the respective GB Players.
So it's either RSE can take trades from Stad2 or Col takes trades from GSC.
This trailer is cute and all.
But i'm mostly obsessing over how much time and effort went into CGI water that good.
It looks better than real water somehwo.
MoonWolf thanks for reminding me to watch Steven Universe.
Oh yeah i hsould do that thing.
Oh ther eis two episodes.
Was that supposed to happen ?
They opened with a double bill yes.
S I'm looking around on bulba and seeing nothing.
I love that Steven Universe's music is always 100% diagetic.
I'm not sure that 100% true but its very often.
Well its songs.
Noelor pearl is still a giant ball of rose related issues.avi.
I only just noticed the date change in topic.
Also steve's dads actor has learned to sing alright.
Heads up for children's card gamers tavern brawl is raven idols would've been a new one but they found bugs on NA release.
And here I was worried about how much time there was for watching aforementioned cartoon.
Noelor no mair.
On account of he's near where you live but not visiting.
That's this week.
Lemme know when you finish watching Mr Greg.
Just in case I forget to say it on friday.
He's certainly not here so sure.
I wont be here for next weeks friday.
Well most likely wont be.
As in 29th?
Tux pearl is pretty good.
There's going to be fanart of tihs.
Ropecon is on that weekend.
Mark my word.
Also wait I forget how up-to-date Glenn keeps with SU.
Spoilers pearl wears a suit.
Err. I am usually up to date but haven't been following things lately. New episodes out?
A couple yes.
MoonWolf just go to Texts Between Gems.
Thats not art.
Not visual art.
Ok not the Peridot one the two following that.
But moderate Mr Greg spoils it's not a particularly plotty ep.
Pearl_is_still_a_giant_ball_of_rose_related_issues.avi is over the episode anyway probably not the ball of issues though.
Noelor have we had an entirely musical episode yet.
I don't think so.
Certainly not 3 song ones.
That's the closest I think.
Before that it was uh...
Stronger Than You lasts for like 50% of it's episode.
Yeah it does.
Noelor oh god that third text is great.
Anyway my alternate title for Mr Greg is actually No seriously Pearl is actually 100% gay for Rose this isn't even subtext any more.
It stopped being subtext a fucking long time ago.
I'm waiting for the actually rose was polyamorous and it was the 80's but pearl just can't episode.
I can believe that.
I'd say this was the realm of fanfiction but this fucking show.
Plenty of mono people in this world can't deal with poly partners.
No thats not waht i meant i meant that this show would even broach the damn subject.
Unless they finally decide to make that elfquest cartoon you are not going to find many cartoons with relationships more complicated than boy flirts with girl or established closed relationship probably as parental figures maaaybe a gay couple.
But here we have steven universe with its incredibly gay rocks.
I'm going o walk the dog now thats its only 25C outside.
Thanks to google search autocomplete TIL Trump once owned a gridiron football team.
But not an NFL team.
No he owned a team in a different league - and then he managed to drive that entire league to collapse.
Also TIL lions are cats with beards.
Pearl is actually 100% gay for Rose <- was this ever in question.
This Metal Gear Rising stream is giving me value.
I mean I am not the best judge here.
GlennCuttlefish some people denied it because they're bigots.
No no it's entirely platonic admiration.
Some people need to get their goggles checked.
...do straight goggles exist?
Is that a thing?
I dont think its a thing as much as the default setting.
If you say so.
Why does this hotel have an army of clones.
Because New York.
Empire City sorry.
Armstrong actually *says* Make America great again!
Well I'll be.
So Peridot took over CN's twitter an hour or so ago.
No he owned a team in a different league - and then he managed to drive that entire league to collapse <- ofcourse he did.
He didn't ruin a team he ruined A LEAGUE.
No no it's entirely platonic admiration <- platonic admiration doesn't get you a lifetime of Issues because your platonic crush fell in love.
Jeez forgot how much of a chore/bore this brawl was.
I mean outside of anime anyway.
First opponent casually got mana wyrm... twice.
Second one literally drafted freeze mage inc the alex.
BwaS i really wanted to try that other brawl with my n'zoth priest.
Ooo n'zoth get you with your wallet hax.
MoonWolf has never paid a cent for hearthstone that I know of.
BwaS my n'zoth is golden and i got it from a pack.
He just has N'Zoth the same way I have uh...
Noelor i payed the smallest amount of money during beta for a golden promotin card.
Which shitty old god do I have?
I don't know.
Summons random deck minion.
The Worst one.
Anyway i don't have wallet hacks i have early adopter hacks.
And consistent player tbh.
For all the golds.
Don't mind me I'll be over here with my hallolzeal and baron geddoutofhere.
Not like its a chore just log in every morning when checking news/comics/lp's reroll anything thats 30 gold unless you are full on slots.
Then play a few games.
Well i just discovered a yogg saron.
I need to start getting deathrattles.
Fuck you brain.
I disco'd one too opponent shaman conceded before it got interesting enough to drop it.
Might have been the totem evolving into a parrot but the rest of the board that came with it was formidable enough for me to be thinking about it.
Well i just stole a validated doomsayer.
I think i've won before needing yogg.
Fuck it clearing tihs board and dropping yogg.
Yogg killed my opponent.
Everything was awesome.
Lets not play this again.
Help i've fallen into a russian folk music hole on youtube.
That is a hole?
Not an unpleasant one.
Anathema I'm not surprised Roxy is leaving I'm surprised that she didn't leave sooner.
Man Jadestar is not slowing down.
Ah gaelic names in general.
Fucking with the latin alphabet in english even harder.
Basically turning it into non euclidian language pretzels.
Well no wonder syncing 800 users is slow we open a new db session for each one.
Well TIL about Tea Eggs.
's a chinese things where they boil an egg crack the shell a bit and then boil it in tea or spices.
Suppodedly its delicious.
Worse than 800 sessions.
1 per user + 1 per each role the user is assigned to.
I feel for your sql server.
3681 sessions with transactions will be opened.
Wait there's more.
Another 1 per user to make sure permissions are set.
You are all sadists.
3238 role assignments.
4124 sessions opened/queried/committed including the query to get roles with ReadAll permission.
How long does this run in.
30 minutes ?
This particular section takes between 60 and 120 seconds.
But remember this is running on the same machine as the database and is effectively DB-bound work.
Also the query to get the roles with the ReadAll permission only needs to be done once not once per user.
It runs on the startup of the application though so it needs to be fast or debugging becomes a paaaaain.
Hmm maybe I should get an actual profiler it is using more CPU than I expected.
I suspect I overdid it a bit with the leveling earlier.
Got a new party member joining my party level 17.
Rest of my party is 33-36.
But I'm innocent I tell you they made leveling so quick and easy with those monsters. They only give 100 times more XP than most mobs.
They can also wipe your party in a turn if you're not careful but hey.
So far I am finding I am setsuna to be an enjoyable old school J-RPG.
For now it's not in our plans to reintroduce the Visual Studio 2015 support in JustTrace.
My finger nails grow too fast.
My beard grows too mast.
!note Noelor.
Sneks are great.
I'm not sure what you're yeahing.
MoonWolf the thing that appeared just after I said it.
Went down to the clinic to get my ears looked at today.
Washing booked for a week sunday \o/.
The RDA of olive oil in said ears is now 4 doses/day though which is whack.
Just spend all day pooring oil into your ears.
Get one of those beer hats but with industrial bottles of oils and the straws go in my ears?
Counter Horse.
You know sometimes you just need to counter the other horse.
Is roborosewater a neural net?
And it was fed on what every MtG card ever?
I should take a moment to point out that by doing so the NN doesn't just learn stupid rules like PatternSpider might.
It learns the grammar and language rules sort of.
So it learns HOW cards work in a very dumb chinese room scenario sort of way.
Yeah I basically know how NNs work.
Someone was asking for an explanation though.
This stream is bad for me.
This stream ?
I ended up looking up and watching a minute of.
Yeah i'm not even getting into anything labeled ASMR let'splay paraody.
I don't even really want to know.
Oh I didn't even notice parody.
I just googled ASMR LP because I was told it was a thing and wanted to know what they'd play.
Doesn't work for you ?
So for Legion prequel there are 'Doomsayers' in Stormwind. When you talk to them their speech is The end is coming - would you like a pamphlet?
For a doomsayer.
I'm used to doomsayers just sort of blowing everything up.
Well we're kinda in the 'your 1 turn of staring it down' phase.
But I'm hoping they all start saying 'I knew it!' when the time comes.
They're dressed accordingly too and have 1.8 mill hp which I guess kinda correlates to the 2/0/7.
Wait they really are hearthstone style doomsayers ?
Its usually more hearthstone does wow stuff.
Less wow does hearthstone stuff.
Egh there's quite a bit.
Hs boards set up with npcs playing.
Ben brode visits your garrison.
You send your garrison followers on a mission to win a tourney.
So you can get more packs.
To make them better at cards.
Followers should have had a HS ranking on top of their ILEVEL.
Winning gets a buff you can apply to follower so they generate more xp from missions.
Sadly deviates there.
Ok the stream ended.
I can stop being led to google strange things.
Well it does something for some people ?
And they can have their strage audio tingly feelings all they want.
But to me its just weird and a little creepily intimate.
And mixing it with LP's isn't going to do anything to help it.
Triforce Heroes LP has resumed.
Which means I get to point out again how happy I am about how fabulous Link is in it.
I'm a 6 foot 2-3 guy whose attracted to guys taller than me. =<.
So when I headed up north I got FE Fates conquest obviously Turns out it's kinda hard.
I'm a 6 foot 2-3 guy whose attracted to guys taller than me. =< <- poor guy.
Guess he's going to need to find a guy who wears those subtle lifting shoes.
The Sailor Jupiter complex is real and awful.
MairBear guess you got the wrong one then.
Noelor I got the right one!
Sailor Jupiter complex ?
MoonWolf literally that guy's problem.
Never heard of it before.
Sailor Jupiter crushed hard on basically any guy taller than her.
Conquest is the hard game. More classic style no map to free roam a la sacred stones / awakening... that ... other one.
Because she was really freakin' tall herself.
Should have bought the babby one.
Its slightly easier for tall girls.
Since it turns out you're a babby.
Because on the whole averages prefer men.
Noelor I ain't no babby >C.
1v1 me etc etc.
Well then don't complain about the difficulty.
Wasn't complaining D.
Just commenting that it's actually hard! Instead of 'hard'.
Right well I'm going to put even more oil in my ears then go to bed I think.
Have good one!
Is everyone here tomorrow night?
Does it come with literally the gayest superhero teen ?
MairBear look a perfectly real and legitimate card leak.
MoonWolf It doesn't buff tunnel trogg unplayable﻿.
I don't think the stamp behind the activation text matches the proposed set logo shown on the other tab.
It does not.
Its actually quite well done in general though.
Ah yes! Survival hunter is back!
Everything is now a hunter weapon once more.
Except demonhunter weapons ?
Those are 'hunter weapons.
Been too long since I played the melee side for me to go SV with Legion.
I have caught up on K6BD.
I thought you didn't like it.
Ran 10k before work this morning feel less awful now.
Whatever works i suppose.
Its good for both preventing suicidal ideation and allowing me to eat an extra muffin p.
Urgh nhibernate issues.
Day is already ruined p.
Just the worst day.
Truely there is no joy in the world.
7 hours of sleep.
Just end it all now.
I pressed the end key on my keyboard but nothing happened.
Thanks for trying.
Really would like firefox to not freeze multiple times a day.
Mine doesn't ?
It doesn't at home only on my work PC.
Does it just hate your product ?
Is it leaking memory or osmething.
Or having massive GC cycles ?
Calm down man.
No need to beat up the building too.
MoonWolf don't use it for work stuff it just browsing it just hangs and needs to be closed. Not sure if it is something to do with being tunneled over ssh or not but I used to tunnel it on my mac too and didnt have an issue.
Wish the switches were just a tiny bit slower.

I'm not sure thats how mimicks should work.
Well no they should be disguised pokecenters.
Yay managed to get a sporran on amazon with 30 minutes left on the next-day delivery deadline.
Also for any who it's relevant to having spent a few mins in the WoW beta I'm definitely in line for legion.
Anathema what's the occasion? o.
Guy who runs my whfrp is getting married tomorrow.
I have completely forgot about a gift though apparantly there was a list but I'm pretty sure it isn't in any of the emails I got >_>.
They aren't really whiskey drinkers so I can't use my fallback gifts p.
Holiday starts.. now!
Its not even friday yet.
MoonWolf I uh... I think you'll find it is.
Its not eve saturday yet*.
Whisky day is every day.
MoonWolf so my opponent in this weeks brawl.
Is a priest.
Who has cast mindgames twice.
I don't even know what his other options could have been that he wanted a 0/1 so badly.
But i an only assume it was even worse ?
Ah it seems I hit the bullshit boss of this game.
Turn 3 he casts stop on one party member next turn he casts a spell that allows 2 more spells and stops rest of my team -> game over.
Get immunity ?
No stop- yeah that thing.
In my previous attempt he just demi'd my entire group to death in 2 turns.
So after getting the key that unlocks all those mystery chests I have been going around picking stuff from them.
And I finally got back to the first beach.
Where the dev's had dropped a bunch of super mobs that look exactly like mobs I need to kill for some spell ingredients. that are level one.
And then I died.
This image is actually great i'm not even being ironic.
Huh. You can access the dev room in this before actually finishing the game.
I am not sure what I expected when I went against that monster.
It has 2 attacks. Meteor and ultimate combo. Both perfectly capable of wiping out my entire party in one turn.
Seems okay so far.
MoonWolf a challenger appears '1719 My god i have 43 gigs worth of Skyrim mods'.
I don't have my skyrim mods anymore.
Probably more t han what i ever had.
MoonWolf last time I tried it it was still early days and I got really bogged down in all the exposition that is Chapter 1-2.
But stuff is actually happening now!
And it's pretty neat.
It is pretty neat!
Did you read the fiction below the comics ?
Gul’dan was just a small-town orc livin’ in a lonely world. He took a… mid-afternoon exile from his people due to being constantly shunned and mocked for physical disability? Going aaaaannnnnnyyyyyyyywhere. Pip continues to be the games news writer we deserve.
The research on Legion I am doing has moved on to alternate timelines and frankly I haven’t had enough coffee for that. fair.
Wait there is still time travel stuff ?
The Gul'dan in Legion is the Gul'dan from the WoD timeline.
Not the Gul'dan from the main timeline.
And he's the one who kicks everything off with Illidan and the titular legion and all.
Does he want his skull back?
Well his skull was kinda on Illidan's loot table in TBC so I guess we assume that Illegiondan doesn't have it anymore.
I do hope Gul'dan knows that.
And didn't do whatever he's doing just to get it back since it's now a nexus crystal.
It'd be sort of funny if he got it though.
If you ever play overwatch.
And you see that guy on your team.
With the huge shield.
Please for the love of gods stand behind the shield and follow him.
Sometimes i try that but then he makes the shield go away for a second and i get shot it in theada.
Sometimes I try that but then he pussies out and backpedals fifty yards and I get shot in theada.
GlennCuttlefish but I can see clearer without the blue tint!!!!!!!!1!!one!
You have to run through the shield to shoot right.
And then run back while you reload.
Maybe guy with huge shield should stand anywhere near the point if he wants me to stand behind it.
MoonWolf what if ana boosts you.
You should run after genji right?
Because boosting makes you fast.
Not the 4 enemies on the point?
Oh hey they buffed touch of death.
It's after an 8 second delay instead of instant but you can start the fight with it.
Wasn't that monxecute?
Still does your total pool of health in damage.
I don't understand how you can start a fight with it then.
Noelor while that is a fair point.
You wont get to the point if you dont follow the shielded guy.
I Gul'dan sense talent and ambition flowing through your weak flesh. Stand by my side and together we will claim the power of the Nexus for ourselves.
Okay blizard i'll play your game if you'll ACTUALLY let me join guldan and be the badguy.
Oh wait no its a fucking HOTS thing.
Not a wow thing.
He's also considered kinda flat in the hots meta so far.
Everything is terrible.
Just noticed the time I might be a few minutes late but probably not.
I have just seen a thumbnail for a youtube video titled Top five MOST disappointing pokémon.
With a picture of Samurott I.
Opnions about pokemon.
Noelor NSFW.
Thats what i mean with tumblr would explode all over elfquest.
Thats the protagonists if there is a singular one dream peacefull afternoon.
Holy shit season 3 of bojack horseman is out.
Why did it get season 2 or.
People like ana.
That mount MairBear.
By the Crystal how horrifying.
If any children's card game players need gold I have the mutual gold quest in my log atm.
MoonWolf because its great.
Oh Blizzard stated at SDCC that Mercy is definitely not secretly evil glad we got that sorted out.
Or they lied.
OW needs a 'decline battle res' option.
Sick of being trolled ressed only to get corpse camped.
MoonWolf Considering that they actually paid the theory some attention instead of shrugging at it has to mean something.
Blueberry is so angry these days.
Just realized I loaded the wrong save today when I started playing.
This one is before I killed the super monster by pure luck.
Hopefully I haven't saved over the right save yet.
Just defeat it properly.
I did defeat it properly it just missed twice.
Which is nice since if it doesn't miss it wipes out my party in one turn.
!note MairBear.
This is just ridiculous. I am failing to kill these mobs the way I want they keep killing me by exploding and I keep surviving with auto rez.
Dealing with *issues*.
I have not watched yesterdays yet.
It features flappy-paddle gear shifts.
Queen carrier might be the best or worst job.
Its actually a side job for being general.
Its not wrong.
Fuck this brawl btw.
I have taken nearly 32 health off enemy healbots this game.
It is a terrible brawl and takes forever.
Who wants the 80g punch a friend quest?
Give it to dob ?
Rip Lightbomb c.
Well thats a thing that happened.
What is this warrior I'm playing against even doing.
Trying to build a gameplan and failing ?
No but seriously MairBear what was even.
That's just rude C.
Its a real deck.
Yeah it certainly worked.
I was just really confused at the start.
Man the difficulty in this game is all over the place.
Most fights I can either win in a turn or two or die in the same amount of time.
I dont understand these monsters.
For 2 minutes nobody did any damage.
They couldn't hurt me I couldn't hurt them and I for the life of me cant figure why.
Does this game have any weird damage type switching status effects.
Zombie or the like ?
It might but I havent seen any so far.
Ok I figured out why I wasn't doing damage that fight but why weren't they damaging me is still a mystery.
Oh finally an episode with konnie in it.
This episode did not feature enough eurobeat.
Worst thing about no more glyphs.
Rogue lost Swrily Ball again.
The oldest of memes.
Today on textbetweengems.
Garnet and Pearl are two terrible parental figures.
Might still be in somewhere there are glyphs that grant abilities cosmetic effects from vendors and scribes.
BwaS Possibly but the glyph of detection is now one of those burned out things pls sell me I'm a grey.
Also another WoW patch.
Another combat bug.
Could be recoded as a fresh object.
Another combat bug <- not ending ?
And by love i mean despise.
GlennCuttlefish new DK talent BONESTORM.
The final episode of Alice isn't dead season 1 wins the Worst placed advertisement award of the year.
They get to the middle of the episode really tense tense scene and BLAM an advertisement for matresses that lasts 5 minutes out of nowhere.
All in all I'd recommend the podcast.
......note to self.
Pressing esc in I am setsuna actually quits the game after the prompt not just leave the menu.
Well that was kind of bullshit.
1v1 boss fight.
Boss can petrify.
Ok going to try plan B Enter counter stance and go afk for 5 minutes.
Seems like quite a game.
Its a good old-school JRGP imo.
With all the bullshit that comes with the territory.
Ps Boss not dead but I'm winning so far without touching the pad.
I think I'm close to winning since the boss started using some flashy moves.
Aand I won.
50g from Mobile Suit Pharah and the latest loot box is non-duplicates.
I'd like to win one game in overwatch today.
But the matchmaking is disagreeing with me again.
So far I've lost I think 5 games in a row.
Join game defense volskaya.
2 anas a trollbjorn.
Time to leave the game.
Did the competitive placements last night.
Landed like rank 27.
I had a better run with fucking Hero League.
Great. now my team has a bastion. on offense. in volskaya.
The platforms attacking pt B can be a bastion niche.
I've been rekt by one running that play.
GlennCuttlefish so uh the crypt. By kara?
In the beta it's called The Forgotten Crypt.
It has altars inside it if you angle your camera right now.
Fanart for tis thread is already great.
Dont do this to me blizz.
What are they doing to you this time?
Man I wish the X-cost cards didn't keep your End Turn button yellow when they have no fucking result.
That'd be nice.
But that'd probably be more effort than 4 cards are worth.
I appreciate that's hard though because some of them can do things at 0.
Well. 3 cards.
I do hope they make more.
Lots of minions big minion damage healing I feel like druid has one?
Druid is the big minion.
Mage has x damage.
Paladin has x * 2 healing.
Is also big minion?
Priest has summon x manacost minion.
While druid has summon 1+x/1+x 1 drop.
5 whole cards!
I like the mechanic though.
They can do more with it.
It is cool yes.
It doesn't have to live on things called just forbidden either.
Although its a good theme for this set.
Golden Possessed Villager looks freakin' rad.
Yeah it sort of does.
The shadowbeast isn't that great sadly.
Chip's next LP a surprise to nobody.
Have not watched the video yet.
What is it ?
Indeed not suprised.
It's Friday Glenn's away right?
Man I just accidentally reminded myself how nice the latest Sims' sex/gender options are.
Oh yeah they just exposed like all the options and were like go nuts.
It's like 4 questions I think but the best 4 questions.
Given the Sims speaks Simlese or w/e which... doesn't have gendered pronouns I guess?
I don't think it has pronouns full stop.
Well it isn't an actual conlang.
It's just noises they make.
If it *were* a conlang I imagine it would only have pronouns.
Because they can't say proper names.
Pretty sure they'd just a generic person sound.
Bah need to finish this wulin character before peple get here.
But its one of those days where my brain is going HEY WHATS THAT LOOK AT IT OH GOD REMEMBER THAT FUNNY IMGUR LINK LETS GO TO IMGUR WHERES MY COFFEE.
And I get nothing done.
Try blocking imgur.
Silly Glenn Imgur isn't for leaving.
Do what Noelor and i did.
Block the sidebar and the comments.
So its not a giant black hole of images and anger.
Comment blocker is an amazing addon for FF. Granted its not perfect.
Mostly because it interferes with the webpage so that sometimes you have to unblock it to do website searches.
Yeah thats an annoying part.
But it only happens when you press enter for the search clicking the search button avoids it v.
But there is value in visiting the site once in a while moonwolf.
Its not a bad site for killing time when you want it.
They didn't want to come out and say war has changed.
But they basically did.
You are such a fucking nerd diesel.
Huh Stallone is in Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
God teen titans go remains such a disapointment.
I dunno seems pretty touch and go.
If people are still interested in watching Inside I'll be starting it at about 3.
And I cba to set up all the shit I have to do to make game sound audible without echoing mumble.
I can put my mic on though due to window layout I'm better able to see hitbox chat than irc.
I'll open up hitbox chat.
Also i hav eno sound at all ?
And your stream claims you are playing overwatch.
This zoolock peddled into an option of shifter zerus. twice. didn't take either.
What a pussy.
MairBear do any classes in legion have spells as satisfying as Flare in FF14?
I cannot answer that.
As I do not know the satisfaction of flare.
Its the best thing ever.
The big ass explosion.
Then doing it again.
MoonWolf So apparently we get to see JAIDS on tape now with the next XCOM2 update.
Video has processed but I'm still waiting for the HD to work.
There we go HD processed.
Wait what that activated already?
So the beeb brought back robot wars tonight. it wasn't too bad.
Going to see Ghostbusters on thursday gotta squeeze in the original in the time between >_>.
If you cant find the time just watch the original instead.
Attempt to do pet battle daily in garrison.
Ground is too uneven to pet battle.
GlennCuttlefish oh you.
Yesss going to see Godspeed You! Black Emperor in a month D.
Wtf one of the guys on the indian team I met last week just said on work-skype not able to add you as a friend on FB \n locked yourself hah.
Anathema they just want to be your frieeeeend.
My knee hurts stupid frail human bodies.
Great my dail ywas 5 brawl wins.
Hope its not a shit brawl this week.
Anathema be more careful.
Anathema put some duct tape on it.
You only get one body.
82% humidity and 204 °C here ugh.
Yesterday it was at 90% humidity.
The weather is reminding me of Japan just lucky it's not +31 instead of +21.
Apparently 27C elsewhere in the country.
Getting a bit too warm and just getting warmer towards the end of the week.
Who does't love 80+ humidity.
MoonWolf hexagons are shit fuck you.
The best shape.
MoonWolf really hard to randomly generate dungeons with though!
I... suppose ?
Hard to build interesting geomorph tiles that fit together.
So that was I am setsuna.
A fun game I wish any of the choices actually mattered.
In traditional old school manner its an choice between yes and yes.
True to the JRPG experience.
Of course if it actually mattered my game would have ended before it even properly started.
Combat system was solid if you like CT the world is your standard J-RPG world except with more snow this time.
There are some rather annoying plot holes or I just missed something.
MairBear so i'm watching the seatstory cup finals i missed last night due to sleep.
Lifecoach is playing 4 decks.
Its 2 hours 20 minutes.
...at the same time?
Both have 4 decks.
Instead of 3.
2 hrs on a single set? xP.
The whole finals.
I don't think even lifecaoch can make on game take 2 hours.
May is very popular in Germany where she’s a character from a childhood cautionary tale about not cutting your nails.
I hear Florida's been shot again?
Ofcourse it has.
Oh dear I am caught in that but is this piece of hardware good enough after all trap when choosing a phone capable of playing pokemon go.
Its not helping that there is no concrete info available on the net.
Every model I have looked at has had conflicting reports.
Its not as severe as last time though from what I read.
Whats not severe? System requirements?
Florida club shooting.
Maybe. thought ou were talking about the Florida thing there =p.
GlennCuttlefish I'm on a HTC Desire 620 about a year year and a half old and GO chugs pretty badly.
But it's hard to tell rn.
A fair bit of that is likely to be the app itself I think.
No idea how Go is on my tablet because it doesnt work outside of Wifi.
It wouldn't no =P.
It is an android tablet so vOv.
Meanwhile in the gunited states.
Any more details yet?
Or just a club got shot?
Minister from what I can see it lacks RAM for starters so I am not considering that phone.
2 dead several wounded three people being interrogated by the police.
That's about it.
I kind of want to get a phone with 2GB of ram but the only ones I can find are either out of stock everywhere or just out of my price range.
Just giving an idea of age and like... the fact that the best phone in the world isn't going to make this app run perfectly.
Plenty phones with 1.5GB of ram available.
Because of the app itself and servers.
MairBear if I do end up getting legion I am not saying I will.
But you most likely will.
Sorry got cut off by the doorbell ringing.
Right as I was saying if I do end up getting into legion my guild leader is fine with you tagging along MairBear.
Did you tell them that you didn't want anything?
Why would I tell my parents that.
Then I might get nothing.
Now if only I didn't have to be Night Elf for DH c.
Would rather be blood elf for maximum over edgy.
Yeah you would.
No Draenei Rogues no sale >|.
I think I'll end up going with this phone.
!note ChaosSmurf you should use your doomface avatar more its amazing.
Nice another XCOM2 video.
Coming in pretty fast.
Good for dinner i suppoes.
He said he had a backlog ready so.
Has more JAIDS though.
There is a certain irony in the second biggest wow style mmo after wow having a patch names Revenge of the Horde.
MairBear> not sure if you saw this getting detect trap back.
I was so sad.
That was the only reason I hated glyph removal.
And now I am fine.
Why is every KotH game now full of mccrees?
I think he got buffed in the last patch.
He's pretty good with his buff.
And ppl bandwagon off what the pros play in the gosugamers weekly/atlantic showdown.
Offensive team that round.
And just one more for good measure.
What time was it?
Ok so based on today and Friday.
If I am missing wednesday evening chances are high I've fallen asleep on the sofa with oil in my ear.
Well then.
Yeh it's been in for a while now.
If I am missing wednesday evening chances are high I've fallen asleep on the sofa with oil in my ear <- hah.
If you just need an evening to catch up on sleep.
Just go do that.
Thats selfcare too.
Meanwhile because I know you don't read commentary.
Today's EGSNP is also Pandora.
I figured that out!
Yeah the hair is fairly distinctive.
Based on *what*?
Nobody else has those two strand going down behidn the ears thing going.
People who like daft animal things.
I found the moonmoon of cows.
Oh hey MoonMoon.
That penguin-looking bird is probably a hatchling making its first dive for the ocean and is probably dead =<.
I think it's from a David Attenborough thing I saw once.
Can't have nice things etc D.
GlennCuddlefish oh boy oh boy! FFXIV added a new dungeon featuring that creepy ass stalker-necrophiliac from tam-tara!
Do we get to kill his waifus again?
Didn't we KILL her ?
Was it her? I forget.
It was her.
Also apparently not?
I remember that bossfight though.
Well do we get to kill her husbandos again? It was a husbando right?
It was neat.
A bunch of the spells effects were like red versions of WHM spell icons.
Certainly some faces in this anime about food.
There seems to be a lot of anime about food these days.
Including like most of a season of JOJO.
I can think of 2 this season.
One of them being a second season.
Hmm got gold dmg and healing as zen.
Rethinking all of my life choices right about now.
Peace and blessings and so on.
Suffering is an illusion BwaS.
Oh excellent the Democrats are also putting their convention on Twitch this yr D.
Maybe they'll be smart and turn off the chat before the convention starts.
Nope it's running just as much as the RNC one was.
They just did a vote of acclamation ayes and nays sounded just about as loud as eachother.
Spokesperson judges the ayes have it. twitch chat RIGGED.
Guess no one was prepared for this.
Yo know i'd like this stereotype to not be true.
But it keeps being true!
What amuses me is that the opposite isn't true at all in this case.
That just makes it worse.
I wonder what's the case with the DNC.
Would that be skewered towards either side or a mix of both?
Now that's a serious case of CLAMP legs if I've ever seen one.
Cooked_Auto i think just generally up ?
Holy shit pharah is 2/3 leg.
As I said CLAMP legs.
Legs like that you can loop around your neck and still be able to stand with.
GlennCuddlefish MoonWolf another free login campaign on FFXIV 120 hours between now and august 31st.
Would you like 80 gold ?
Terrible matchup.
Also that spider was downright evil.
Was like everything battlecry? D.
Also brb queue procced the second we finished.
Most of my pirates are battlecry.
The trend of putting pearl/gems in male formalwear continues and its amazing.
<- fanfic is getting weird.
Anathema this fanfic is ASMR somehow.
How does that ven WORK.
Words have no meaning anymore fanfic has ruined all of langauge.
Anathema and/or MoonWolf can you recommend a password manager program with an android app?
Don't use one sorry.
Nor do I.
Use one you have to pay for though.
Do y'all just re-use and other stuff we're not supposed to? Or just keep your passwords in a doc somewhere?
I have a small set of i don't care about these account passwords that are honestly horribly insecure.
And memorize good ones for important stuff.
Oh boy its one of those rounds.
3 hanzo in my team.
Defense. even so unoptimal.
We need a sniper tank.
So we can have all sniper teams.
Anyway I basically do that with passwords atm but.
The list of important stuff is growing.
I can ask someone for a password manager with an adriod app.
Won't be able to help you with it.
Plus the number of things I'm giving my Google cert is starting to worry me.
Since the GO thing that is.
Well look at that.
Ftrbzzs I was cycling home last night ~2230 and met Geoff out catching pokemon. dedication!
No amount of putting the team on my back could have helped that.
Did 37% of my teams damage.
How did the opponents overcome such a volume of being consumed by dragons?
I saw relatively few dragons.
A couple good ones.
Yay main story quest finished for another patch in FF.
Now to deal with what else I want out of my way be legion's time.
How was the revenge of the horde ?
The story version of the boss was fun!
I imagine the hard mode of it is intense as hell though.
Also the achievement for beating it is Floor the Horde x.
What kind of sides would go with a chilli and lime seasoned steak? something with peppers?
ZWEIHÄNDER is a tabletop role-playing game designed to support grim perilous adventures. In short it is a bloodier grimmer and grittier version of classic tabletop RPGs you may already familiar with. The community calls this style of gaming the “pathetic aesthetic” but I simply call it grim perilous gaming.
WHFRP clone.
Still tempted to back Coriolis.
What is with this game and mounts?
Gotta keep up player interest bro.
I like the picture in that kickstarter.
Behold all the fucks I had to give now on fire.
I have to interview two people about Demon Hunters tomorrow.
Everyone already knows everything about Demon Hunters.
Well 90% of game inteviews are identical between outlets anyway.
So nothing new there.
Yes but the difference between me and 90% of writers is I'm good at my job.
Then go hogwild What would Demon Hunters prefer to drink and eat?
What is their prefered music genre.
Ask if Sylvanas will ever become a Demon Hunter. p.
So if demon hunters were a raid instance why are they the underside of karazhan and where is my underside of karazhan blizzard?
So when is Jaina going to get killed by the Demon Hunters in the next raid?
ChaosSmurf When's dance studio?
Anathema you think Geoff is dedicated being out late but I was out even later catching pokemon from lures with some tech uni students..
At least I blend in.
MairBear don't tempt me.
ChaosSmurf when can we have a vanilla server.
Anime Anime a player name in FFXIV.
I already wasted one question on those idiots.
And they've quietened down.
But smurf it was a better game then.
Particularly those TBC dungeons.
Worst thing about WotLK dungeons didn't need all but one mob sheeped after they finally gave shaman hex.
Anathema well I find comfort in the fact that I wasn't the only one!
ChaosSmurf why do you have to be physically located in Bath to work for a website?
I don't but offices are good.
I am considering moving out now I'm being kicked out.
But they're going to give me an underling which should make my job way better so I don't want to.
What wears a stupid hat and does fuck all against enemy reinhardts?
Answer My team.
McCree is the only hat wearer I can think of.
Can none of them look up and press e?
I suspect blizzard made mccree too good again.
Every game all mccrees.
Hasnt changed my games with all the double genji hanzo widow.
So it seems this new mini-dungeon is fun and weird but plays differing musics as you go into it.
EG right now I'm on the greatest dungeon theme Pharos Sirius'.
GlennCuttlefish good news they just nerfed mccree again.
Took 10 meters off of his fallof range.
And nothing of value was lost.
And increase rate of fire in hammer.
Catching up with Steven universe again.
Kind of upset they didn't even use eurobeat in this episode.
Woah the proclaimers are playing nearby on the 7th o_0.
Youtube finally logged itself out for some reason after years.
And I cant access that email anymore.
Well thats shit.
Guess I had set up recovery options through google.
Now I just need a free secondary email to set recovery to.
...oh fuck off since when have all free email addresses required a goddamn phone number.
What is this dystopian bullshit.
Yasss free sports massage at work today.
GlennCuttlefish we live in the cyberpunk future.
The neon just hasn't catched on yet.
What is even the point then.
Well i'm hoping for vibroswords soon.
See that stuff that absorbs light and then glows in the dark?
That's a bit radioactive / toxic right?
Not in any amount you could remotly care about.
But i think so.
Think how amazing it would be to get a tattoo with that stuff in it.
The stuff fatigues pretty easy and i don't know if it works below skin.
But it would be neat.
I just want glowing neon tattoos science needs to get on this.
It really does.
Still not sure where I would a tattoo even a glowing one.
Topic still accurate?
Unless hexagons are no longer the best shape.
Last night I had a nap AND a bath.
Living the life.
Then went to bed before midnight.
And oil ?
And oil yes.
I wish I had a proper bath.
You have a sauna!
I have a sauna yes still would like a bath.
GlennCuttlefish just get a palju in the backyard and you'll be fine.
I wish i had a bath i fit in.
Heat up with wood fire feel awesome.
Sounds like a lot of effort.
Minimal amount really.
I'm not sure I could fit one in the backyard the garden is kind of in the way.
Should get one of those for the cabin.
Burn the garden.
SunTiger its a beautiful garden I.
'd rather not.
Man that's a thing I need to consider for buying a place needs to fit the bath barrel in the garden..
Something went horribly wrong with that round in my opinion. Healers were only ones on point.
Insert need healing spam?
At least they had the good manners to die quietly.
Good on them x.
Best thing about completing Phantasy Star Online was always the credits.
It had credits ?
Most games have a credit sequence?
But its an mmo.
Huh. good thing I procrastinated a bit with getting the phone I can get a honor 6 for 180e now.
SunTiger nah PSO was an action RPG with an online lobby.
It was pretty fun.
Apart from that one time going online corrupted my level 114 character.
SunTiger guild wars had credits ffxiv had credits.
Speaking of though the new dungons thing is fun scales from 1-4 players no restrictions on tank/heal/damage etc.
If you or glenn use your free hours I definitely advise checking that out.
But i'll keep it in mind.
I think i'd prefer to just cosume FF14 in massive bursts of story.
Rather than patch by patch.
I'm pretty done with mmo grind.
How much time.
<- well this is a thing.
20 minutes ish ?
Might even be good.
Ok if I'm not back in 20 minutes assume something went horribly wrong.
You'll make it! You're gonna be fine! D.
Wait it didn't reset yet?
I've not seen you reconnect.
Odd. guess I need something pointier to reset it.
No wonder I couldn't remember the wifi pass.
It was b0bw4sh3r3d1k3t1but3t1.
That'll learn me to set wifi passwords after a night of drunken gaming and in-jokes.
Glad we established that.
That's easier to parse yes.
I always get the Bastions who have their M1 sellotaped down even with a genjee doing his watatata bollocks right in front of his hitbox...
GlennCuttlefish MoonWolf.
> Tentacles for fucking Arms.
Free epic of your choice!
ChaosSmurf ChaosSmurf.
Ask them when they're giving us sentry totem back.
But phrase it like it involves Demon Hunters?
ChaosSmurf ask them when they're implementing spectator mode for RBGs.
And other peoples garrisons.
Will there be demon hunter followers retroactively added to the garrison recruitment pool.
Can I have that exclusive mount that can no longer be obtained?
Wait what I completely missed that season 7 of Archer started in March o_0.
In June 2016 FX renewed the series for an eighth ninth and tenth season each consisting of eight episodes. woot.
Yeah maybe each one will be longer than 20 minutes? probably not though.
Butts lost my loyalty card thing for the coffee place nearby.
I was more than halfway to a free coffee.
Can't be that loyal if you lost your loyalty card.
I'm not since I got the card last august and it only takes about 10 stamps p.
Their coffee isn't a great roast they add faaaar too much milk even when you say just a little.
Ask for.. no milk.
I'm just lazy and want a breakfast bar thingie to last me until my late lunch since I wont be having dinner until like 2100.
MoonWolf it's barely good enough to drink even with milk!
Don't see why you bother then.
Lazy + it's slightly better than the machine we have in the office.
Also I have to code review lots of shit today need my caffeine!
Well good thing your job has fancy coffee then.
Oh god this XCOM2 update.
So what are opinions on Windows 10 since I'm not really able to put it off much more.
I like it.
Prefer it even!
And I can say that fairly since I have to use 7 at work.
I do not personally regret my choice to go from 7 to 10.
Although there is some awkward things left from win 8.
One day they'll stop trying to make the configuration screen better.
Because i think there is 3 generations of config screen bullshit in this windows.
Bits are in modern windows app interface bits are in the win 7 style and bits are in the old classic style.
Depending on how esoteric it is.
Thanks for telling me i can recruit my friends in HS and get a shaman hero for that blizzard.
Next time check if i HAVE THAT HERO ALREADY.
Eh as long as it doesn't make me pine for Win 7 and feel this is an objectively bad choice I'm all for saving money xD.
Seriously whats so hard about putting some filters on your mail list for is this relevant for tihs person.
Thanks for the input you two!
MoonWolf maybe they were telling Smurv?
But thats not smurvs email.
Smurvs email was a sharklasers.com adress.
Don't ask me why my totally legitimate friend and real person Smurv used an email adress on a host known for throwaway accounts.
Smurv just likes privacy.
So I was taking pictures of this unique historical rifle and then I accidentally disassembled it.
One moment you're looking at a gun the next you're carefully taking it apart.
Whatever you say Ian.
Win 10 installs no internet try for a while to fix Say f it and turn it off and on again. Internet works. But my desktop is empty and my histories/bookmarks missing. Try turning it off an on again everything is back to normal but no internet. Turn it off and on again once more.
I'm 90% sure Microsoft is just listening via my mic now.
And fucking with me.
Maybe they are.
So do you have no desktop/bookmarks right now ?
I have desktop and bookmarks and history and shizzle. Oh I forgot one minor part.
After I got internet back apps were in Japanese.
Did you have your applocale for windows 7 set to japanese by any chance ?
Before you upgraded.
I think so actually.
Like I can't remember the last time I did anything in applocale at least over a year ago.
That looks unhealthy but delicious.
Yeah yeah it spretty humid.
Eveyrone has 19C.
This is interesting.
Right thats pokemon sampled up to level 5.
Tomorrow I'll try the battle thing.
And mexico will pay for it.
Dont worry I wont take my pokemon rage outside Finland.
I shall start a petition.
To rename PotG.
To Play of the Genji.
Because thats all I get now.
Eugene okay woah kool-aid.
Dob became PatternSpider.
I think Uber happened to it.
Ghostbusters was fun.
Maybe Glenn will finally play HS.
MairBear talk about playing HS.
Can you win a game for me ?
I also see that today in imgur it's upvote literally everything that usually dies with no votes.
MoonWolf sure sure.
Today is a no going to imgur day then.
That's a rock not a pokeball! Stop throwing those things D.
You make the pokemon dodge rocks.
And then when you are tired.
You throw the ball.
Saves on balls.
MoonWolf this isn't safari mode >C.
Also ready when you are.
Omfg I need to take that shitty silithid out of this deck.
Why is it still in there.
Cos I forget to edit every time.
Wait what feary dragon.
Is this an attempt at a weird dragon druid ?
Thanks for the pack.
IDK but it loses to weird dragon weapon warrior.
Yeah now fix your deck.
IDK what to replace it with so I just put in that 2/6 taunt with enrage.
Cos fighting that sucks.
Its better than silithid.
Most things are.
At least you gave it an honest try.
But even in a deck swiming with weapons.
It pulled some impressive weight.
Cooked_Auto your country isn't having enough sex.
Swedish goverment starting a massive inquiry into swedish sex lives because they are concerned.
Why not? or is that what they want to find out?
Well it helps to know if they are or not.
And probably find o ut why at the same time.
Fuck humidity so much.
I'm going to move to a desert.
No wifi there though.
That is a problem.
Legion DH dev qa I personally like the playstyle as Vengeance but it feels squishy.
Asked a leather wearing melee dps class who runs in to battle shirtless.
Was that a question or an answer?!
The prelude to the question of can u fix dis?
Cos if question even the shit I was spewing that was intentionally nonsense was better /.
Plus I toyed with it in beta.
It contends with blood dk for indestructible bullshit.
Not squishy then.
Not the tankiest in raw damage soaked.
But self healing to make DKs jealous.
I had forgotten lapis lazuli was literally the most OP gem in SU.
Starting to appreciate angry symmetras.
That is... surprisingly fluid.
You came 12th in your age category I'll take it.
12th on waht ?
Beat my personal best by like 2 minutes.
MoonWolf Amazing.
Garona's cannon status is so muddled that blizzard can't even decide if the son they made a pile of comics about exists.
That trailer was something else too.
Garona is in Legion I know that much xP.
The trailer was pretty dumb because most of it came down to khadgar visits kharazan. shoots a laser baem. leaves.
Nothing was accomplished.
Oh I mean the Kara party trailer.
Screw the rest.
That was good.
Mumble details me someone.
ChaosSmurf eagle.mumbleboxes.com 36007.
Password if i recall right was maybeshewill.
Gul'dan's one was a bit dumb also.
I have a hometown I won't tell you where it is and no-one knows as I killed them all.
Not really filling in the gaps of their past.
Yeah i'd much rather something happen or be revealed.
Going to a place and then leaving the place having accomplished nothing.
Doesn't really do anything.
181542 › ~MoonWolf nothing was accomplished - WoW.txt.
CookedAuto its actually a story about khadgar not getting corrupted.
Which is basically a first for blizzard!
Those ahve been pretty good imo.
ChaosSmurf but they don't actually move story.
Neither do the OW shorts.
Things happen but the story doesn't go forward.
Thats not exactly true ?
The initial blizzcon trailer established the legacy of overwatch introduced 4 characters and established that doomfirst was some sort of legendary badass.
The winston initiates the overwatch recall.
The tracer one spells out human omnic relationships and why they are currently much more on edge.
The soldier 76 one is basically do nothing.
You could make identical arguments for harbingers trailers.
The hanzo genji one explains their shared history and they end on better terms then they started.
The Blackhand fight is really rad.
You guys see the new cards?
That new warlock card has some great potential.
The rogue card is technically good but does not support a good deck.
I mean the mage and warlock one from today.
See what i said about the warlock card then.
The mage card is meh.
I wonder how OP the mag card would be if it was discover.
And how many bad hits there are.
It'd be amazing if it was discover.
I'm thinking of dragon rogue for that new card to work off Nefarian.
If that card was in priest it could be good.
But the problem with rogue is that all their ways to get non class cards are random.
While priest pulls from deck.
So that gives them a big edge.
Friendly minions only.
!hs Gang Up.
No i'm wrong.
Its not friendly.
So in pokemon go news the internet has started shipping Candela and Blanche pretty hard.
I dont see any problem with this.
Since you're prolly not gonna do it MoonWolf the Discipline priest artifact quest is pretty cool.
ChaosSmurf i don't really feel like watching an hours worth of a wow quest.
I've been second-screening it obv but you can skip through travel and it won't be that long.
<- thats just how an average finn reacts to temperatures above -5c.
Completing Mankind Divided on Hard difficulty unlocks a mode titled I Never Asked For This. In this setting players will only have one life to get through the game. Progress can be saved along the way but if the player dies that save gets deleted. oh god.
Today on Steam gender-flipped Phoenix Wright made in Ren'py.
Also Just Deserts is a sci-fi action dating sim where you play as a soldier who must protect a city from mysterious alien attack while at the same time you will also be seeking to capture the heart of your dream girls!
Noelor i'd like to think gender flipped phoenix wright would be good.
99% of vn's are garbage.
So it probably isn't.
Yeah pretty much my reaction.
Went into town today bought an actual CD for my brother.
Those still exist ?
Because we've discovered that neither iTunes nor Amazon digital allow me to buy him mp3s from the other side of the planet.
And iTunes besides won't let me buy him anything without my own account.
Wouldn't want poeple to buy things for other people.
Then I went round my folks' but they weren't in so I had to post said CD through their front door and txt them what it even is.
Mum's flying over to visit him in August.
Which i'm pretty sure british people are allergic too.
Take some antihistimines.
ChaosSmurf top quality pun card.
I think it's also quite good.
Though possibly priced out of playability.
It has to compete with blackwing corruptor.
Which is a hard sell.
That is a hard sell.
It does kill high health low hp taunters tho.
And will still be in the format when corruptor rotates.
Thats a good point.
But when that happens we are loosing a lot of core dragon cards.
So they need to be printing more dragons besides book wyrm.
Or we won't see dragons in standard.
Well there's still two large sets and adventure before rotation I think?
I take it there's a spoiler list somewhere?
Personally I use pee cee games enn dot com.
Also wasn't the rotation set to be annual?
Yeah so we have this adventure then the final large set of this year then an adventure then the first new set of next year marks rotation.
We'll have this adventure and then a big set for this year.
Then the start of next year we'll have another big set and that'll be rotation.
Is it two adventures a year?
Set adventure set each year.
I assumed it was just one of each one after the other.
Since adventures are infinitely easier to make.
They are not.
I feel like Kara's the 4th adventure?
They are less cards.
But much more effort in well adventure stuff.
Significantly less cards.
Moroes what are you even.
Making them GOOD isn't easier.
Blizzard has a things compared to WOTC.
Also Curator what even.
Sure you don't have to super balance a boss only card.
But its still a card that needs to be programmed vetted debugged art made for it.
Art and possibly animations.
That's still way easier than making an entire set.
For the card designers.
Not for the game development side.
Pretty sure thats just as time intensive if not more so.
Moroes seems incredibly shit if he just makes 1/1s.
Yeah moroes is not very exciting.
Good shit me.
Noelor its an incredibly dull technically fairly statted beast.
More attempts by blizzard to make beast druid a thing.
Kibler's vid on it sold me.
I mean it trades really well for a 1 drop.
And might be good with buffs.
But its also boring as fuck ?
You put the buff spell on it.
That draws a card.
Turn 2 4/4 charge.
ChaosSmurf its hard to get excited about imho.
Moroes goes with like.
Hobgoblin et al.
Hobghoblin is played not summoned.
Worse than imp master tho innit.
Imp Master has a shelf-life.
But probably aye.
MoonWolf well just et all then because hobgoblin isn't even standard.
ChaosSmurf what do you think about the draw a beast dragon and murloc card.
Ethereal Peddler seems a bit of a troll.
I think its interesting and has potential.
I think it's really cool.
Its good draw potential.
And remains playable in a fatigue situation.
Which is key imho.
Paladins already play a beast and a dragon.
Adding one murloc knight could be worth it.
Yeah I like it.
It is a 7 mana 4/6 tho.
Is also a mech!
Just need to get pirate on there somehow.
Also a demon.
I forget if we have those outside warlock yet.
Other than Imp Master who is not herself a demon.
ChaosSmurf's presence has reminded me.
Someone told me yesterday I should look up the Flash S3 trailer from SDCC.
Link me I don't think I've seen that.
Noelor i'm not sure you care but apparantly the headcannony parts of the internet have decided that Blanche from Pokemon Go is nonbinary.
Did you hear Cat might not be in Supergirl any more.
Blanche is the one I can't remember.
Making it the most pointless show on television.
I haven't Supergirled.
Other than the croxxover.
Well so long as you watched the crossover.
Oh my god Ramon.
They say the thing!
That trailer sure enjoys hamming it up.
<- pokemon go characters.
Arrow S5 looks alright.
Though mainly looking forawrd to the flashback half of it.
Thats mainly why i never even got through S1.
It wanted to be the epic family/friend drama.
And a superhero story.
And a flashback story.
S1 is so bad =<.
And all the time i'm just like acn we please move on with the fucking thing i'm watching for.
No pleaes no stop introducing new characters.
I wonder if anyone's done a supercut of just the flashback parts or everything but.
I feel like the flashback parts of S1 are more required as context for future seasons? idk though been ages.
Yeah well i deleted it from my hd weeks ago.
So i don't think i'll try again anytime soon.
ChaosSmurf also as you're here actually.
If I log into WoW again it's your fault.
Just for the record.
Smurf is chris metzen confirmed.
₧ <- this single character that exists for some reason.
Has an alt-code.
Ə <- this one which is a very useful IPA character does not.
I'm therefore annoyed.
IPA is a little.
But ə is the most common vowel in english.
And there are greek letters bound to alt-codes too!
More people write greek than IPA.
If I wanted to write greek.
I'd probably have a greek keyboard/character set?
Like I don't write 你好 with alt-codes.
I switch language.
Just copy paste from character map like the rest of us.
I don't do that ?
Except for really niche shit i do like every 2 years.
You type with the international character set though or whatever it's called.
Us-International keyboard layout.
There is probably a Uk-International one.
Dob and I don't type with diacritics often enough to switch to that.
But often enough to learn workarounds.
Like my learning to type é.
And Dob learning where the character map is.
Man sprouts these days.
Submit it to reapernames.
Noelor everyone's going to have fun in WoW.
But MoonWolf grinding and patchwork lore.
But MairBear not those things.
~MoonWolf i'm not - the same. I'm like three expansions behind anyway v.
CookedAuto guess we don't count.
I'm pretty sure that scheme wasn't new back then.
Pretend i made a terrible joke about the sun.
Noelor My angel name is 419 Burn Without Hesitation Or Remorse. I am having a hell of a time finding someone who will kill me again.
Its the dumbest joke somehow i still like it.
We were at the ADVENT site.
But it wasn't a rocket.
Everybody had crazy outfits.
Somebody went under a dock.
It was a Rocket Lobster!
And there they saw a rocket.
Terrible poetry in the xcom 2 lp thread.
Well that's song lyrics more than poetry.
Should've been a cellphone.
I'll find the authors twitter and let them know.
No need =p.
Good it'd have been awkward anyway.
MairBear today in new xcom 2 mod enemies.
The Shoggoth is a new Faceless. These act just like standard Faceless but they hide as vanilla Advent Troopers. These guys will act just like any regular Trooper including shooting at you. They will transform to Faceless when they are dealt damage.
You think you are shooting a trooper but NOPE its a faceless.
That seems significantly less good than the civilian ones.
Unless they don't take the damage from the shot.
I see no problems with either way.
Feeding maybe but that baby is gonna get ripped in no time.
Baby needs protein to get buff.
Suddenly all D.Va team on offense.
Now all hanzo on defense.
I suspect we lose.
At least 3 of us have the Sake voice line.
...okay sure. That's a thing.
GlennCuttlefish all D.Va is the best team makeup.
I'm not sure that's true.
On an unrelated not I really want to visit Aokigahara someday.
What is that ?
Large dense forest on fuji mountain where people go to commit suicide.
Or you cuold... not indulge in suicidal ideation.
It's a popular tourist destination.
That uhm doesn't really diminish the creepy factor for me.
It has cool caves too.
And is very dense no sound apart from the sound of the forest.
When are we getting eva 4.0.
I need my fix.
MoonWolf or a rerelease of the platinum dvd collection of the series.
It's fucken impossible to buy.
Also MFW I realise I've got plans every weekend in August o_0.
And only one of the things is play games with people !
That time of the year again?
The nice thing about maining mage in WoW.
If you were going to follow up that line about nice thing about maining mage.
Is never having to relearn buttons when I get back.
There we go.
Pretty sure they take some buttons away and give you news ones every expansion.
I also had a paladin in WoD.
Looked at that character and her action bars were decimated.
Biggest change to mage was they removed Arcane Int.
Well they just made it th epassive it should have been a decade ago.
They just adjusted all the damage and/or health numbers.
Didn't it become one of those automatic group buffs ?
Nothing in my spell book though.
Most buffs got removed.
Paladains kept Greater Blessings but you can only have 3 instances across all 3 blessings up a a time.
One gives a small shield every x seconds one gives y% health/mana every z seconds one makes you kill things better.
I miss my button though =<.
You can always make a macro to look like it.
Make it emote putting arcane int up.
Minister do you feel your fantasy has been compromised?
Anathema lil bit.
Mainly just because I had the special version from Dalaran though I think.
MoonWolf only Holy Paladins get auras now too and you gotta pick one as a talent and they are a bit weird.
A bit weird ?
Nah prof has ret aura at least.
One of them is as long as you have more than 75% health a portion of damage suffered by nearby allies is redirected to you.
Minister oh I haven't looked at it yet my bad.
Anathema thats a great combination with paladins massive self heals gimmick thougjh.
Is that their gimmick?
Also they get an instant cast heal that hurts them for a % of the healing done.
I mean there's lay on hands?
Is bacon still there?
At some point in the history of holy paladins they had a heal self and target heal.
What's their mastery?
Also holy mastery is now you heal more when you are next to the target.
There's a talent that makes it count nearest of you or beason.
Melee healer I guess.
Paladins supposed to be up in there.
I thought we had monks for that!
Anyway their mastery may have been % self heal at some point.
What about seal of light?
It got clubbed.
Seals don't exist at all actually.
Can't throw hammers are people anymore either.
It's a bit bollocks.
Other than mastery.
Can you still fart yellow ?
What benefits *are* there for being in melee?
What benefits *are* there for being in melee?
Hitting things with your hammer ?
Counterpoint you get hit in turn.
MoonWolf fart yellow?
Kirisu the auras are really short ranged IIRC.
That's a talent now for non-prot specs.
That is definitly how that is spelled.
Ok but your hammer's probs shit.
Also don't work while casting iirc.
I've just being doing it for fun on fights when ChaosSmurf wasn't taking any damage because warriors are OP in 5mans atm p.
I know one of my friends elsewhere was really miffed that both his hunter spec got nerfed. Possibly his rogue spec as well.
Did he play srv and combat?
Have to ask him when he wakes up/shows up on Skype.
Seal of light is a ret talent that gives you short movement speed buff.
Perfect timing. I finish mowing the lawn about five minutes later it starts pouring down outside.
Ana that is not.
Should have called it seal of alacrity or something.
20% buff for x seconds per holy power spent.
Why light of all things.
Muster for taunt.
And +5 cards for your deck.
More like Release the Dudes.
Also wtf Prince.
How is that balanced.
The average legendary card isn't that great.
But i'm predicting it being in a lot of control decks.
Because they tend to go late.
And 5 more cards is a great thing if fatigue is a real concern.
I wonder if he's class-bound.
I assume he's block bound.
Thats a neutral card.
No I mean.
Shuffling Grom into Hunter.
Oh i assume he works just like every other draw random cards card.
So he'll grab other class stuff.
He will be block bound in standard.
And not in wild.
But you have to realize that there is uhm 4 legendaries per class.
Compared to tons that are neutral.
So getting a non neutral other class legendary isn't going to happen that often.
And as much chance of getting stuff like 10-drop 6/6 6-lobber.
Getting a free n'zoth or yogg might be useful every now and then though.
Yogg in not his decks.
Gets you like a couple Hoarders or w/e.
Playing yogg at the end of a game as a hail mary can get you a win or a boardclear.
Or just loose anyone.
But chance at not loosing vs loosing.
I'll take my chance.
!hs saron h.
What is his sodding title.
!hs Yogg-Saron Hope's End.
Omg I didn't even mean Yogg.
I hate the old gods.
How big is deathrattle guy.
!hs N'Zoth the Corruptor.
He's pretty intimidating if you manage to bring back anything of value at the same time.
Even worse than Thun if put in a deck non-intentionally.
Not really deathrattle is a core part of card mechanics.
Almost every deck has SOME deathrattle.
And there is like 3 that are actually a downside.
Unlike yogg who can just fireball you in the face.
Tbh the only fatigue deck I can think of rn is C'thin warrior.
Any control priest.
Has to consider fatigue.
Priest already has NZ.
Does C'thin have rattles?
I accept I'm over thinking this btw.
Just stopping my mind going numb.
Something bothering you in specific ?
Nah just that sort of day at work.
Ah i can apreciate that too.
Anyway i think its a cool card.
I'm going to put it in decks.
You've convinced me it's not an auto-pick though.
Which was my initial reaction.
Yeah no anything relying on careful curve or low cost cards.
Is no going to want to get 5 random cards shuffled in there that could be way overcosted.
2 or 3 bad draws in an agro deck can mean you are now loosing.
Nor combo decks.
Fuck off Majordomo I'm trying to find Alex.
But you cuold set your max health to 8!
If I could Majordomo my opponent.
That would be great.
I don't think there is a combination of cards in HS yet that can achieve that on purpose.
Your relying on an opponent Sylvanas.
And no way to get that in their hands either.
Todd Sylvanas is not common enough to be worth putting Majorodomo into my deck.
Ftrbzzs blame people here.
Everyone except MoonWolf.
Fuck burning crusade 2.0 demon hunter boogaloo.
Gee thanks for that jerks =|.
MoonWolf it's like Burning Crusade 2 take 2.
We did go back to Outland!
Now it's fight Illidan and demons again!
Also in this expansion illidan makes lich king like ominous story appearances.
Illidan is back?
Did you not watch the trialers or anything for the expansion ?
He's on the cover and everything.
He's not in the cinematic MoonWolf.
He was in the blizzcon thing.
It's the Sylvanas and Wrynn one.
Yeah I watched sylvannas.
I didn't know illidan is back that is silly.
Gul'Dan from the time travel dimension revives him or something.
And I think that's how Demon Hunters?
Oh yeah in WoD we travelled through time.
There's an h in that place's name.
Are they redoing karazhan in legion?
No hs expansion.
Also the h is silent anyway.
Your face is silent.
It's party time.
And all I hear is a variant of One Night in Bangkok.
Best Jackie Chan movie?
Drunken Master? I dunno never seen too many of them.
They've not currently announced Kara for Legion.
But there's hints.
Apart from the final boss.
Turns out the remake will be the HS expansion one.
Disco Medivh will make you dance the night away.
Imagine the day where you get hearthstone cards as loot in WoW.
Anathema i'm suprised you can't get cosmetics as boss drops or something.
And lose out on revenue from the cash store? nonsense.
Cosmetics mean a lot less when the engine can't cope with chest armour that has polygons.
I think they finally started adding those.
Or support for them or something?
Maybe they'll finally add cosmetic ony drops this expansion.
Now that they have their fancy new transmog system.
That's been around a while.
One of the buildings in the WoD garrison had a bunch of cosmetic armour.
Yeah but you don't have to hold onto the items now.
They can just flag them cosmumables that add the pattenr to your library.
If you log into WoW rn Wrynn mails you a cosmetic sword + shield.
Alliance only i presume.
Kirisu yeah but they looked like ass the garrison ones.
Presumably Vol'jin also something.
Horde get a different sword and shield.
Anathema I liked the cloth one!
Kirisu both the plate ones sucked.
You need a shirt with the cloth one mind.
Alliance get sword/shield horde get axe/staff.
Movie promotion that I think is going away imminently ish.
Oh right yeah guldan's staff.
...that's for the movie?
I was just remembering something from the history of an alternate dimension so I thought I'd give y'all swords.
My friend got back to me he was running Marksman and Assassination.
Kirisu in warcraft terms thats perfectly normal and sensible behaviour.
Awwww yissss.
The fuck is a z move.
Once per battle move you have to dance to do first.
Is that a MegaExeggutor?
No just the Aloa version of it afaik.
Minister some pokemon in pokemon hawaii just... are different.
And come with different types.
I really like it.
Its also a Grass... Dragon.
And they should make them for all regions.
Also comes with a tail. With a face.
Igloo Sandshrew omg =3.
Ice ninetails is AMAZING.
I love that thing.
Its majestic as fuck.
While I mostly dont like new pokemon these are ok.
Its like something out of trigger.
Gotta love it when two plays of King's Elekk function exactly as Bloodfen Raptor.
I'm kinda into that.
While I didn't enjoy ropecon this year as much as I had in previous years for a couple of reasons the cosplay level was extremely good this year.
Any pictures somewhere ?
This thing had an in built voice modulator among other things.
That one looked even better from behind.
Oh man that is some high effort cosplay.
I love it.
Not sure who is on the left.
But its good costuming.
Who knows if its anyone this is a rpg con not everyone is cosplaying as a pop culture character.
Yup cosplay was on point in 2016.
There is gloom and doom and things go boom?
Ez. Says the red team only taking points in overtime and losing the full round.
Fucking red team.
Scum of the earth.
Red Team Bias.
Gotta love being unable to practice literally any hero except dva as all my teams think 0 tank/5 dps/1 ana is the comp to go for.
Even then solo warrior isn't even the meta in Heroes and that runs 1 fewer team slots!
Yesterday I dinged my paladin to 100 and commenced to boat on my mage.
Boats seem weird.
I didn't boat.
So i can't really comment.
It's just garrison but with 6 boats instead of 25 friends and you buy items to give the boats specific traits instead of rng.
Also there's a tab that I think I shouldn't be able to see because I can't interact with it.
That does seem better.
Do your boat gain item levels or sail levels or whatever ?
Didn't look that way but.
I have no max level boats yet.
A fly has outsmarted me the little asshole only sits down ON MY FLYSWATTER.
SunTiger fly got gud.
I'm with Minister on this.
Ftrbzzs people might think this sounds racist but russians are literally somewhat cancer in every gaming community people are mad the Russians are getting merged into standard PoE.
Anathema what a lovely bunch.
Totally not racist.
Anathema made a scion this time in the new PoE league.
Will see how it turns out.
By new league do you mean prophecy? >_>.
New to me!
But not new in absolute terms p.
Player name + title Salty Bumcake.
Now I am not saying my team was bad but I got PotG as lucio. and most objective kills.
Zarya with russian weightlifting skins.
Zarya taking roids confirmed.
Well my first game of lucioball went exactly as expected.
Pretty sure I scored an OG.
Next game went a lil better won 4-2 scoring 2 D.
Power ranger poses?
Power ranger poses.
0 support solo tank double torb vs double sniper.
Best comp EU.
Ah I see they have reclassified symm to warn your comp has no healers <3.
Urge to make a new lalafell character.
Name it ginyu nyu.
I just looted a sassy imp.
It's a toy apparently?
It's amazing is what it is.
You know usually I'd be happy about a legendary funbux box.
But not when the new skins cant be bought.
Same with me got a legendary skin in my latest but was the crow reaper one.
Bit of a kick in the dick in the balls that I can't use all these saved up funbux.
Even when I saved them just for this sort of situation.
Mordheim juggalo themed orc warband posted in /r/Warhammer.
This I have to see.
Last episode I saw was greg getting the monies.
Spoilers Amethyst is in the show.
Spoilers this show has feels.
Urgh those are the worst.
Spoilers Steven also present.
Why are you such a jerk today?
Because you dragged me back into WoW.
Sometimes there is singing.
Frequently there is crying.
I'll take a kids show with genuine emotional distress over one where the protagonist is sad for a week and then every must return to status quo.
Because kids don't reset to status quo between days either they haev family members who die parents who seperate friends who stop being friends. kids need to deal with shit too.
Minister uh pretty sure you were already playing when I resubbed!
You were online Sunday.
Ok well I did absolutely no you should get back into wow p.
Peer pressure though!
Jokes on you I'm already thinking about uninstalling it!
Writing a cookie backend to Storage api because browsers are awful buggy messes #thisismylife.
SunTiger what show is your subtle dig aimed at?
None in specific.
Well that sorta takes the magic out of it.
A wild teenager appeared in the office.
And it is 90s as all get out.
Have you tried throwing pokeballs at it ?
Backward baseball cap trainers with flashing soles...
Are those a thing again ?
Keep throwing those pokeballs.
Anathema nah I think its mam just couldn't sort out supervision.
SunTiger now that everything is cheap you can charge them wirelessly so they never stop flashing.
HOW GREAT IS THAT.
A little great ?
Btw anathema have you read any of the Craft Sequence books ?
Don't think so.
You should try them i think they are the kind of thing you like.
Its a very different kind of urban fantasy.
The second one features a depressed gay ceo lich.
Ooh first one is only £3.80 for kindle bought.
He's depressed because he helped murder a whole bunch of gods and it turns out murdering the gods is great and all that but someone has to keep everything working so he's been spending the last half a century doing highly advanced magical water management for a city in a desert.
This not a spoiler this is basically the premise of the second book.
Guy doing risk management for the magical water management that keeps the city going.
Oh god Connie is a doomsday prepper.
Connie is a precious cinnamon bun I.
Or whatever the idiom is.
Where did that phrase even come from ?
I'm not going to KnowYourMeme from mobile.
But it'll be there.
Beautiful Cinnamon Roll Too Good For This World Too Pure is the headline for a satirical article published by The Onion in early 2014 which subsequently became an exploitable catchphrase used on Tumblr to describe adorable charismatic or otherwise sympathetic fictional characters.
There you go.
Also I've realised I need new office shoes.
Because the heel of my right shoe is now a full centimeter shorter on the outside than the inside.
A friend at work who hasn't played since TBC just reactivated his account because of me.
Is this a subtle way to get Noelor to give you more SU spoilers ?
Anathema I'm giving you the look right now poor Geoff.
SunTiger like the fact that Garnet is not on screen enough in any given episode that isn't Jail Break?
But we get more connie now!
As much as I love Connie.
She's not quite Garnet.
I think the cast may have gotten to large for 10 minute episodes.
Starting to get there certainly.
Ftrbzzs I've told him at every step not to do it!
Its okay internet we gte it can we let the joke go now please.
Its getting a little obsessive.
Anathema on Scots Wikipedia.
I have just discovered that what an Angle such as I would write 8th is in Scots written 8t.
And have no fucking clue how to pronounce that.
Oh xp scaling.
3/4 of my party got 350xp from that fight the remaining one got 10k.
11 levels in one go.
Looks like he's playing it safe again.
Bah. out of beer but my leg is busted enough today that I dont really feel like going outside for more |.
This is the final insult.
Opened my summer loot box.
And got the swedish flag.
So far my summer loots have been a sym emote a junk voice line and I think a widow player icon.
Gonna be a little late.
Tea comes out of the oven at ten past.
Noelor is drying their own tea apparrantly.
Thats dedication to tea.
Mumble die for anyone else?
Cooked_Auto quit too.
Mair and i are still there.
I got DCed.
Wait no its just dead now.
And its back.
This is Kaido. He may look like a punk but he's a good guy who wants to do right by his friends. He's voiced by Travis Willingham who is Guile from Street Fighter Dan Green's replacement as Knuckles the Echidna in the Sonic the Hedgehog series and Lon'qu from Fire Emblem Awakening. Coincidentally he's married to Laura Bailey who is not only Amane from this game but is also Lucina.
From FEA. heh.
Voice acting power couple.
Slightly more that one line for the character.
5 for the voice acting history.
CA's ideal LP.
Its the Shin Megami Tensi LP if anyone is curious.
The original SMT or latest?
That's on my maybe read later list.
First time I rolled really poorly in combat in the SW campaign. It only took around 10-ish sessions to happen v.
This is how I usually roll when shooting.
Okay that one is better than average.
Explosion is a Success the wings is an Advantage and the saber is a Triumph. You really want triumphs because you can do some fun stuff with those.
Same with Advantages.
On the flipside there is failure threat and Despair. You don't want despair.
Oh so it was.
3 advantages but without any successes to actually apply them to?
Pretty sure there is a threshold you need to overcome too in this case.
That whole second fight was... embarassing on all fronts.
The DM even played Just Do it via the jukebox and we still performed... less than optimal.
Noelor MairBear.

Can't stop listening to _.
Does anyone else care about spoilers for the Harry Potter play?
Its unlikely I will ever see it unless it pops up on the net.
I've been reading the script on kindle.
Reading scripts sounds really boring.
As fiction goes.
It's no bad.
V different to prose but.
Anyway turns out it's a time travel story.
Unrelated I have just received an email in which recipes are referred to as hacks.
Food hacks ?
The title is Summer Hacks.
Summer hack cook food.
Harry's kid goes back in time to change something and breaks things so he has to keep going back to fix it all.
I'm sure nothing will go wrong on subsequent trips.
Time travel is always a bad idea.
Including for authors of scripts.
Why would you do that.
Last Hero Quest from the base game tomorrow.
We are taking a break before doing the expansion considering trying to convince my friends to play Exalted.
Good luck with that.
Urgh went to replace an earring this morning and my ear started bleedings.
Still sorta bleeding.
Ok sure game usually I can agree that my game is too slow and I get removed because of that.
BUT DONT FUCKING STALL IN THE MAIN MENU FOR 40 SECONDS BEFORE EVEN ATTEMPTING TO LOAD THE ACTUAL GAME AND THEN BOOT ME FOR INACTIVITY.
Jesus christ blizzard.
Game can't handle the power of lucioball.
Yeah I always get it where the lucioball countdown finishes before the loading screen does S.
Oh look a tumblr for Noelors.
Decline nouns by how many of them you can take on in a fight.
Create a future English where “guess who” becomes the new 1st person pronoun ok that one's actually brilliant.
This sounds great too.
Okay this is weird.
My keyboard and mouse have gone nuts.
Oh I see what happened there. One of my shift keys got stuck pressed down somehow.
Aka Right Shift the one button no one really uses v.
Noelor knew you'd apreciate it.
Cooked_Auto technically you use it for lefthand side capital letters.
I guess. Never use it anyway.
MairBear did you see the new hearthstone card ?
Turns out Atiesh is a good hunter weapon.
Yep medivh into quick shot to bring out a doomsayer. the dream.
I was more thinking coin medivh.
Followed by callof the wild.
For a decent chance at a huffer and rag or king crush or a ton of other powerfull 8 mana cards.
8 mana is a bit of a cramped high power legendary slot.
Maybe even another medivh!
I couldn't find any of the Legion lead-in stuff in Stormwind.
I did find some sort of cult though decided to join.
Noelor legion pre-event invasions and so forth descend on the 9th/10th. All we have now are the doomsayers giving us pamphlets.
How friendly of them.
MairBear I couldn't even find a doomsayer though =<.
Between the auction house bank and inn I thought D.
Enemy uses Yogg.
Destroys all minions except our highest-attack ones.
Shoots Yogg buffs my minion shoots me then tops it off with...
Truly fingerpori is the best finnish comic.
Ftrbzzs strugglign not to laugh as geoff yells about assclowns in a skype meeting behind me...
ChaosSmurf oh good you have an interview with wow people and you got the classic we didn't do enough stuff last expansion but this expansion we're going to do better talk.
Damn no Mair.
Okay the gay space rocks now have a character with LITERAL RAINBOW HAIR.
And yet people are still in denial.
Only just saw Connie's first mission.
Is pretty fucked up right now though.
Anathema there are terrible puns.
Ran out of pokeballs today.
Now you'll have to walk around outside to get more of them.
In combination of having terrible aim and that pidgeot now being rightly nicknamed houdini used 20 balls in one encounter.
Not today I wont. might do that tomorrow. Depending on how lazy I am feeling I'll do it while having a pint.
I have learned that the nearest pub to me is close enough to a pokestop that I can farm it while sitting down.
GlennCuddlefish latest build also has a bug making catching pokemon harder.
Now you say bug.
Bum didn't go to the pub for someones last day at work because I was supposed to have a thing tonight but it has been postponed.
Dont you still have time to go to the pub anyway?
I don't have a time machine.
I'm not quite sure I understand the correlation here. unless you were too afraid of a hangover.
People have already been to and returned from the pub which I did not go to due to lack of time.
FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUCK YOUUUUU OVERWATCH.
First skin I get from summer games?
Cooked_Auto can you do something for me ?
Is twitch working.
And can you run tihs command line thing and pastebin me the results nslookup twitch.tv.
Well the twitch side loads for me.
Oh and the name of your isp ?
Netcomp I think.
Thank you very much.
Funny enough my router lets me do that and has more info than uding the cmd line.
The first two NPC's Aggro spoke to in Limsa were both Miqo'te so this is probably a good time to cover the very last A Realm Reborn race. Note that there's one more race in the game right now but I'm going to keep that under wraps since the story leading up to the expansion takes some pleasure in slowly revealing it. Well that's going to take years v.
Only if more breaks happen.
It's LPs. Real life will always cause breaks.
So today I partly thought about using the 13A rules for running a The Secret World one shot or such and then kind of stopped because it felt like I was falling down the Pathfinder hole.
Got one of /those/ games today where someone spawns in as widowmaker in fucking lucioball.
Good job blizzard.
Does she even do ANYTHING with her gun to the ball ?
Although sniping th eother team might be a decent contribution i guess.
Possibly I dunno.
But yeah the fucking cunt decided it was fair play to stick around and take free headshots on empty flat terrain.
And I didn't feel like rotating out so someone else can spawn in and get camped.
And I'm sure any and all reports sent for harassment/cheating as a result will just get a shrug like the rest.
Oh an epic drop from the summer games set.
> japan genji.
The best genji skin.
BwaS btw would you like to have 80 HS gold ?
Wouldn't mind no.
Fight me then.
I thought i was going to loose that match at the start.
Yeah had a shit hand and my 3 biggest cards drawn far too early.
Was there a nzoth coming up by any chance in that?
If i had drawn it yes.
That was n'zoth rogue.
If you hadn't silenced my tauren.
It'd have been pretty suck.
I can imagine.
With the copy and a copied deathrattle from a raptor.
Nzoth doesn't interact with raptor does it.
Only things that the original card has a deathrattle on.
Cool just checking.
Otherwise we'd be seeing really sick shaman n'zoth decks.
Had some guy in wild drop reincarnate on his sneed shredder. to bring out a sneed shredder.
!note MairBear.
Noelor sorry sorry I'm sorry sorry.
MairBear wow this quest to sneak through the camp.
What the fuck is this.
ChaosSmurf just murder everything.
One at a time.
It's easy as monk cos we can just use our 30-second stun if we agro two of them x.
It's mega awful.
Even if it was well designed which I don't think it is it would be mega awful.
Holy shit this is hateful.
Ahahaha it's so completely random.
In a Blizzard game?
Say it ain't so!
You're already in it.
And yeah our 5th for Fellowship is AWOL again.
Probably due to internet SNAFU.
Oh right I thought you were just ignoring me p.
But now it'd be a pain to move =P.
Oh lovely my second screen is probably about to die based on all the flickering.
Im sure dad has a spare small one he can grab from work if I ask.
I started a Patreon maybe a year ago mostly as a joke with funding goals like having Jenner read her Wizard fantasy fiction story or playing the terrible anime games people sometimes humble bundle at me. I pledged the Patreon would be used for hookers and rootbeer. So far it has only been used for rootbeer but bless the people that feed my addiction. Well that's one way to use a.
Welp. looks like my second screen has given up for real now.
Turned it off last night before going to bed and now when I turn it back on it flashes the desktop for a second before just going black.
Welp looks like another 3 months of priest terrible in HS.
Because none of those cards are going to help priest.
The best kind of air tank.
Oh look a game of lucioball where some wanker spawns in as zenyatta.
Even Heroes had better matchmaking than this.
Fill out a 30 spell deck to quick run a daily quest.
Get a mill rogue opponent.
Pull out a win as he gets misdirected into facetanking his own emperor.
Pack from gold drops a legendary... and it's The Beast =S.
Wins with 30 spell decks are great.
Starbound quests!! So a bird person gave me a quest to deliver a note to another bird. The first one then asked me to go back to them and ask for a gift of a clock to use in a bargain. Fine so far.
The bargain was... to go to the person they got the clock from and offer them this clock they just acquired to be friends...
Mairnai yay randomly generated quests.
I love K6BD so much.
Mairnai one thing a bout this game though.
FUCK FALLING DAMAGE.
Its the most lethal thing in this.
Not monsters not survival mechanics just falling damage.
I think its the only thing thats killed me.
Double jump helps... but yeah.
Are you playing it soon/now?
I'm doing morning stuff first.
You know breakfast.
Rss feed forum threads HS dailies.
Insincere. Have an absolutely wonderful day. - Glitch NPCs.
The magma rain on this planet is so hot it burns the sand.
Free glass ?
Nope just destroyed blocks.
Whats even the point then.
Super Metroid there.
Making me physically sick with anger.
One of its main sources of difficulty is making itself impossible to control.
So many things just completely rob Samus of momentum.
6 hours of sleep hangover and I am watching a youtube video where someone is demonstrating an automatic sauce stirrer.
But at least I have some amazing breakfast.
Noelor that sounds highly unfun.
GlennCuddlefish why are you watching that ?
I think its perfect for this moment.
Its a video on random kitchen gadgets.
For breakfast I have eggs bacon a glass of milk about half a liter of coffee and some onion mushroom pie.
So either I die of the hangover or of cardiac arrest.
Now he is reviewing a thing for hollowing bananas.
Why... would you do such a thing ?
Apparently so you can fill the banana with stuff.
Seems very high effort.
For a fruit that doesn't need to be filled with anything but more banana.
Banana is good enough.
But you could fill it with like cake.
Or chocolate cake.
But you can put the chocolate on the banana.
Instead of inside of the banana.
But thats just boring.
Would you really want a boring bananana.
Now in the test Egg squarer.
On the whole banana has never bored me.
I'll just eat a banana or a banana with some chocolate on.
No need to put it in the banana.
Ah nice might get a new secondary screen some point next week. Only a 17 but whatever. It's for IRC and for when I stream movies.
Did mccree get buffs again while I wasn't looking.
Ro why was that the third game I have with all mccree team.
Not that i know off.
First thing you learn Guava has some awful taste in tv.
Damn it Jade get the other two parts uploaded.
MoonWolf Thijs won a game at legend.
Went down a rank cos his oppoent was a slow priest.
Priest at legend.
Evil coconut tribals!
Beats fucking minions in my book.
Everything about this sounds insufferable.
Starbound has some lovely set pieces.
I got frustrated with loosing all my shit down the bottom of a cave from fall damage again.
And uninstalled it.
Like this underwater fish-person arcade.
MoonWolf D.
I did find a series of caves filled with very tiny buildings.
Not sure what that was about.
But it existed.
No gnomes in sight.
There's a chance when you break the houses that you can get a gnome cap a gnome that you can wear on your head or a gnome-gun.
Plus you can pick up throwable gnomes that scream when you hurl them.
Also your uninstall reason is why I play casual mode D.
I just want to not die because i fell for a little more than a screen.
Usually because a monster knocked me back.
Shame shame c I'll let you kjnow if I see a fall damage prevention/reduction mod but I don't really trawl for mods all that much yet.
I'd be happy if i could have just exchanged one of my fancy movement techs with something to not die.
I don't need a dash i'll take slowfall sort of thing.
I gave up on Terraria because of the monsters and them getting in the way of me exploring. That and I felt it took too long for things to happen with the crafting so it grew boring kind of quickly. Hence why I didn't really bother with starbound in turn.
MoonWolf So in XCOM update 9.2 Guava and Jade argue about Spark skills.
I still get bitter memories about Terraria's underground worms.
F those things.
I was mostly annoyed over all the monsters just bugging me as I was digging in caves or exploring.
But also you unlock double jump immediately after dash as long as you find 10 silver bars. It doesn't really prevent fall damage but it can be a clutch save at times.
Starbound still has that in... most places. Not a lot of spots that are monster free.
And the rules to prevent spawning are troublesome with flying monsters.
MairBear i think barren planets are monster free ?
The one i was building my base on wasn't spawning anything aboveground anyway.
But also NPC free c.
Ocean planets are also rather quiet.
A few agressive fish but easy to dodge and deal with.
Moons are also entirely safe as long as you don't touch fuel.
Why do we power spaceships with material that atract terrible eldritch horror creatures to you if you mine it ?
MoonWolf IDK that wasn't a thing before launch.
Dunno why they had to even add that from a gameplay perspective.
Incentive to actually visit pointless airless supercold moons ?
Oh I mean the ghost itself.
Fuelling in moons was around for a while.
Cooked_Auto damn jade and his lack of having uplaoded the bossfight.
Nathan drake parkour master even in his pre-teens.
Oh? Uncharted 4 LP up?
So it is.
Oh the Star Wars Rebellion LP is up too. Neat.
Oh snap another Shadowrun audio campaign log.
Looks like I'm going to be playing a lot of TSW because there is no other damn way I'll be able to listen to all of these episodes otherwise.
Mu You'll love this one.
This one's Italian.
Its a musou game pity I have little interest in berserk.
I'll try it out looks like a solid game and the graphics look nice.
Lost Tower p3 is up btw.
Going to watch it after dog walk.
Well. That was not expected.
Pretty sure Blizz is just spiting me now.
Getting the glorious nippon genji skin was bad enough but 'scored' one of the new tracer skins as well.
I feel your pain.
¤#¤%#% swedish trollbjorn.
At least yours doesn't have a skill floor above the maps' invisible ceilings.
I'd preferred the genji one.
BwaS Update August 8 2016 Blizzard are working on a fix for the Lucioball exploit that allows players to play as another hero warning abusers to expect punishments.
Aye saw that one.
Hey weird neurotic question maybe but how close in tone are any of y'all's faces to the backs of your hands?
Not very because my hands are currently slightly tanned.
TIL OW now runs finding a more balanced game when it cycles its matchmaking.
Blue team winning in overtime now counts as unbalanced.
Story of my fucking life.
And of course the potg is the red team dva ult that I'm definitely sure I got around the corner from...
And I wonder why I don't bother with Terraria.
CSS is rubbish.
Huh sure doesnt feel like 17.
I did not expect the final panel.
I knew what should be coming and yet.
MairBear there is a level of meta-irony in that.
The last panel was your own boot to the head.
Truly I have had my head booted.
SunTiger no more weather apparently. Ever again.
Yup weather is over.
We got rid of it.
It was annoying.
Always changing and affecting plans.
It'll be 20C with a softbreeze and alternating clear and a few clouds forever now.
20C!? soo waaarm.
It'll be cooler in the shadow!
Temperatuers are usually measured from the shadow though aren't they?
No clue honestly.
So Rehgar's in game title is now ...
Uurgh so frustrating how bad they made ret paladins atm ¬_¬.
Try a different class ?
I think I will have to.
MairBear can you transmog the Legion artefacts into any random weapon or only the artefact skins you unlock?
Anathema what's wrong with ret? D.
Are they not pulling numbers?
But also will be able to tell you in a moment haven't checked.
MairBear dunno about numbers it just isn't any fun.
Close in your face melee deeps Arms Warrior is at least twice as fun.
Amazing so as part of the elemental shaman artifact scenario you meet Chen and Li Li things go as expected.
I don't know who Li Li is because I did not play Panda.
Or Heroes of the Storm apparently D.
Li Li is Chen's niece though.
MairBear you walk around drink tea and talk about adventure ?
I did not play HotS either no.
You summon tons of tiny water dragons and shoot everyone ?
SunTiger okay I mean they have a friendly duel where Li Li runs around throwing bottles of healing and being annoying.
And chen keeps turning into a barrel and drinking.
Damnit chen this is not behaviour you should show your impressionable niece.
You are a terrible authority figure.
I mean she tries to stop her joining in the fight.
Chen tries to stop her*.
Anathema your artifacts can be transmogged.
Same restrictions as servers One hand swords can be axe or mace but not dagger or fist so on.
Do you know how the level boosting interacts with professions?
I found a video that explains it o/.
Yessss a friend is going to mail me some caterpillars to eat.
And a recipe.
MairBear these are not wrong.
Welp got a second screen again. Now to just get used to it looking slightly off in the colours.
The colours thing is much mroe annoying.
Pity the max resolution for it is just 1280x1024.
Guess I'll just drop the brightness and contrast a little.
Pity but unsurprisingly changing the display port from blue to white didn't do much =p.
Oh god this screen squeals |.
Thats pretty shit.
For some reason whenever its powered off or in sleep mode it whistles.
>Updating AMD drivers >Asks for a reboot.
I thought we had left those times =|.
Okay so I can't turn the thing off or else it starts to whistle and I can't figure out what causes it v.
Yeah good thing dad brought with one extra screen but that one has speakers mounted to as well.
So I mean I can switch to that one if I wanted to.
Oh thank god I could mute the built in speakers.
At least I can downsample the colors to below 6400k on this one as well. So that's a plus. Makes things look a lot warmer.
Turns out the high pitch noise was just a sign that it was old and somewhat cheaply made.
And now I'm stuck at 1440x900 resolution v.
Wonder if I can find a 21 screen on second hand anywhere in town for a fair price.
Ordering a new one seems honestly overkill.
Oh god and now I notice flickering lines in the background of the screen D.
Just don't focus on them.
Yeah good luck with that =p.
Granted the issue is exasperated by the fact I have a black background on IRC.
Switch to a light grey or off white.
Worth a shot.
Problem is kind of with how washed out the screen is it almost looks worse with some colours.
Well light grey is out of the question at least.
Guess I really have to look into buying a new secondary.
You'd think that around 20 screens would be cheap but not by much. Or I'm just stingy as hell.
Blizzard broke the mass disenchant button for me.
Where's Mair god dammit.
It is half 7.
He slept at normal times at Noelor's.
His sleep schedual just sort of progresses.
Eventually it wraps back to normal.
The ever moving circle.
Its the ciiiircleee of sleeeeep.
I was gonna try to dodge spoilers on the the broken shore cinematics but making it to tomorrow is going to be impossible.
Turn of the internet ?
Go to sleep really early.
I am considering going to bed.
But I think I'm going to have to write about them tomorrow anyway.
Man Cata flight paths are still a fucking mess.
Had the culture shock the other week going to Outland and being reminded Nagrand gets only 1.
Oh dear.
Not going to lie if I had even less self respect than I do I would get one.
If I were still 15 I might.
Yeah no I'd rather stick to shirts nowadays.
Jeez overwatch's hero league landed me somewhere so bad I get hanzos asking team what to pick mid-round.
And others with an abject phobia of choosing support having never played any of them before.
Also the less-than-zero sum ladder that sends you down even further when you're supposedly at the bottom of the fucking bell curve.
Omg gem art.
Guys please watch Steven Universe.
Up to how far.
Saw bismouth new ones after that?
I just watched the 2nd one after Bismuth.
Ok. will have to catch up again then.
About to watch 3rd.
That 3rd one was superplot.
If anything the NMS soundtrack is good.
Veni Vidi Wipe - Guild names!
I like it.
Ooh an epic.
2 pieces of item level 700 loot! For the two slots I have that are 705!
That off this mini questline thing?
Off the new invasion event thingies.
Brought my own teabags to work so I can finally get a good cuppa.
This fucking office.
Anathema damn them.
Ftrbzzs did you know Shaun has tarantulas now as well?
Anathema I did!
Aaaaaargh our CSS file is such a mess.
Ctrl+a delete.
Mairnai if I do end up subbing would you be willing to move to a pvp realm? The realms population is heavily slanted for our faction.
Ftrbzzs have some instrumental djent.
GlennCuddlefish hell no.
Never making the pvp realm mistake again B.
Thats what I told them as well.
Questing is tedious enough without random rogues murdering you and then emoting on your corpse.
I think this is the realm we were considering.
What did jaina do ?
She's still not over Thrall finding another girl.
Damn Jaina get over it.
Or make a thrall clone or something.
Tbf aggra is about as interesting as watching paint dry.
Thats because blizzard never lets her do anything.
Still more personality than Lor'themar or Baine though B.
Her defining traits are being brown and being thralls wife.
It's okay Sylvanas will still be perfect and save everyone in the end.
Is there a sylvanas raid yet.
Thats the other raid that would bring me back to wow. I just want to kill sylvanas is that too much asked?
Save everyone from having too much flesh and not enough bones showing.
Karazhan and murdering sylvanas. two things that would greatly improve the game blizzard.
Its free money I am giving you here where is the end product blizzard.
110544 › GlennCuddlefish thats the other raid that would bring me back to wow. I just want to kill sylvanas is that too much asked? - Yes because its not going to happen because the current dev lead loves her too much.
Its more likely that there'll be a Jaina raid encounter than Sylvanas.
Sylvanas I totally don't want to kill all the living is the best.
I'm sorry Warchief Sylvanas.
Playing Alliance sucks can't go visit her without a lot of friends.
Just be a rogue.
My mid 80s rogue is Horde.
If they kill Sylvanas.
Horde is literally without anyone people remember the names of.
They'd have to *gaaasp* develop characters.
8.0 The player is the new Warchief.
MairBear no no Gamon is the warchief.
Well Varian is dead as well so it would be a natural development.
...Varian is whatnow? Who is leading the alliance then?
....well this is a brilliant plan and nothing could go wrong.
U nder anduind rule everyone will get along.
MANDATORY GETTING ALONG.
Don't mind all those mind control swirlies.
9.0 we'll bring Gul'dan back for his redemption arc.
Is Tyrande still alive?
Granted their online comics hinted that Laine is coming back as he's been hanging around with Velen.
But she's useless anyway.
Anathema yeah but nightelves havn't been relevant since vanilla.
They made her character worse.
The voice actor got better than the oddness in Cata though.
When she suddenly had a troll accent.
I don't remember that and I played Cata o_0.
From what I remember reading she suddenly turned very clingy/dependant on Malfurion and her brilliant strategy at one point was I'm going to charge the enemy with my archers.
Really the nightelves dreanei worgen and tauren should just fuckoff and form a third faction.
And the blood elves.
MairBear wtf |.
Anathema that's from End Time.
Too busy saving the world and caring about nature not into that whole war thing alliance.
The cata dungeon in the paradox timelines.
But yeah she sounds like a troll.
Oh I think I stopped playing before that came out.
Survival Hunter is terrible.
The shapeshifting and moon magic is cool faction.
Anathema pffffff it's amazing!
Blood elves into moon magic also welcome.
Actually takes effort to play hunter spec.
I didn't find it fun the abilities are weird you have lots of spare GCDs.
Honestly I prefer that myself compared to BM where you literally have times wherte you can take your hands off the keys and still do full DPS.
Yeah but BM gets Bestial Wrath and stuff.
Tldr melee hunter isn't as fun as Arms warrior therefore it is bad p.
Watched the cinematic. Would have been better if Varian didn't get jobbed.
Anathema true enough.
I might give it another shot I did jump straight into a dungeon.
I did the same and regretted it at first xP.
Cos you can't really sit and study your abilities when that happens.
The more I look into the initial setting of legion the less I want to play.
GlennCuddlefish I do not much like those cutscenes Mostly cos beta skipped them so I was lead to belief that something meaningful happened to piss Jaina and Genn off.
When it was just oh we didn't really see what happened so obviously we were betrayed right.
Ehh I can understand those two being pissed off.
Im not opposed to them being pissed off.
I mean they haven't exactly had good interactions with the horde.
Just it's not really a betrayal.
As much as I hate sylvanas the broken shore thing I can thold this agains ther.
Just being a bitch as usual but at least for a decent reason this time.
Also we can all be pretty sure that while she might be a bitch and may be planning world genocide.
She hates the legion a whole lot more than just living people in general.
See that is the reason why I hate her.
And I can't understand why the horde hasn't done anything about her.
And yet we had to take down Illidan.
And all he did was get mopey.
But noo cant do anything about the glorious leader of best lordaeron.
Becuase blizzard itself isn't sure if they want to go maybe a little bit evil vs world genocide.
She has used biological weapons of mass destruction.
And got caught.
Whichever one will lose the least subscribers.
And then said oops wont do it again guys seriously.
And then did it again.
Yeah but Cata was a mess.
Don't use these weapons they're unethical -Garrosh Cataclysm. Don't murder entire towns in Stonetalon- Also Garrosh.
End of Cata LETS BLOW UP THERAMORE BOIZ!
And Sylvanas was a nonentity in MoP really.
Also why does garrosh hate giant death weapons anyway.
He's the one with the fucking giant robot arsenals and the IRON STARS.
Not manly enough.
Actually I am amazed by one thing.
The legion didn't decide to outfit everything with FEL STARS I mean Gul'dan coulda pinched the blueprints and everything.
SunTiger Also Jarraxus makes a cameo.
So the way this invasion works 2 zones are actively being invaded for 4 hours then when that passes 2 other zones are flagged.
It's a 15 min or less scenario to defend and each character can clear a zone once I'm assuming daily/per cycle.
So iuf you are only doing it with one character that's only two invasions every 4 hours as your limit.
What do you get?
Don't coutner to much invasion other people need to get a turn.
Special currency for some 700 items toys transmog.
And a box half way through that gives an ilevel 700 item and a bigger box at the end that gives one or two.
So far seen weapons and armour.
Also damage numbers.
You get to hit things and then damage numbers pop out.
Anathema yeah.
The items all have unique skins but for 200 currency you get in 10s and 5s you can buy the full transmog for an armour type.
How long does the invasion last?
Like the whole event.
Until Legion launches?
I think so?
This sounds a lot like the Heart of Thorns pre-event.
All I know is it won't be beyond the launch.
Maybe if players counter hard enough the invasion just shouldn't start.
What about that blizzard.
Did you consider that.
My protagonism D.
Nah then they'd just handwave it away.
Pure GW Massive campaign style.
SunTiger given how cakewalk these are.
We'd already have won.
We've been sending millions of demons through these portals for the last 3 weeks and they 've ALL DIED. we should probbably call of tihs invasion and come up with a better plan.
So why does Sargeras want to end all life in the universe anyway?
The old ones afaik.
Well that and Azeroth is special.
Cos someone told him no bad so now he HAS to.
So now he's all.
It bears repeating that the NMS soundtrack is pretty good.
Also still very much tempted to back Coriolis.
!hs Medivh the Guardian.
!hs Medivh the Guardian.
There we go Karazhan support.
And fixed the tweets with images thing too.
Noelor hop you're happy.
I am happy.
Could it be ?
Then my terminal recognises it as an url and I can click.
Lemme restart VS.
Well my internet is being really shitty today.
Might also be wow but everything is being awful not just wow.
Do you want http or https.
Https obvs gotta be encrypted.
Yeah its important these twitter pictures default to a secure connection.
I hope you don't absolutly need a closing slash on that.
No that works <3.
They need to be HTTPS since they'd redirect me there anyway since I'm logged in and the session cookie will be https only.
This is a terrible joke.
Definitely by game time though.
I realized today while reading the 13A rules that my initial idea of running it a classless TSW game would not really work as I had initially thought p.
Don't suppose anyone feels like winning a hearthstone for me?
Hm might as well just buy a new secondary screen.
Noelor enjoy your dust.
20 dust and a brand new Shadowflame!
An actually useful card.
Just like my golden tentacles for arms!
No shadowflame is actually good.
Its an amazing boardclear with a cheap minion and power overwhelming.
And generally a good boardclear if you just have to clear because it can reach 8 damage orsomething with a giant.
I'm sorry friends but I must admit my reach has exceeded my grasp when it comes to game-prep today. GlennCuddlefish Noelor.
So with sincere apologies i have to cancel todays game.
I should have started prep like yesterday instead of after dinner. Sorry.
!note MairBear sorry cancelled game on you while you were away.
Consequence of playing my regular chars with prelaunch event - I'm the only thing stopping the dps being all daemon hunters.
Penumbra +3 Two-Handed sword. When you get a killing blow choose 1.
- Encounter - Use a Recovery.
- Gain +2 Damage on melee attacks stacks.
- Daily- Gain half damage as thp.
Penumbras Grasp - Recharge 11+ Kill a mook or target of much lower level instantly. This counts as a killing blow.
Got the draenor legendary ring finally fully upgraded to 795.
Man that took a lot of hits.
Now we wait to see how many quests into broken isles it'll be replaced by.
SunTiger I am unsure what half damage means especially in relation to Penumbra's Grasp but that seems real cool otherwise =D.
Half the damage of the killing blow that you used to trigger that power.
Penumbras Grasp counts as half the remaining HP of whatever you killed with it if you want to combine it with the dialy.
So if you killed a mook with 36 hp per mook you would gain 18 thp.
And if you hit someone for 20 damage and that kills them you would gain 10 thp.
What's much lower level?
Say 3 levels or so ?
I've not looked at similar powers yet which is what i'm going to do.
Before i put anumber on it.
Anyway you shoved the universes best soulgem into the universes most soul eaty sword.
So i made it better at you know.
If we ever wanted to set another campaign in this very.. derailed TES universe this would have Consequences.
Wonder if tESworld would fit Fellowship.
I feel like yes?
You'd have to reskin the artifacs away from being racial.
And i'm not sure if the defining your own species thing combined with a fairly well defined world is a great combination.
But you can make it work.
I think it'd fit better into the dragon empire really.
Lovin' this tavern brawl where the deck recipe is concede shaman.
BwaS do not like this tavern brawl.
The days before the new adventure you release a brawl all about the... last expansion ?
Come on blizzard.
Thats the wrong way around.
Should have made it last weeks.
Then this week cool new cards.
I'd be okay with it if I didn't have a shaman daily quest to clear where my win condition is 'hallazeal plus ele dest'.
That too these are not great decks.
And warrior just good old c'thun controll warrior.
Meanwhile nzoth tempo rogue opponent yayyyy~~.
Also known as armor for fucking DAYS.
Followed by a 20/20 or something.
The mondo standard shaman deck rn is moreorless f2p right?
The one that's mostly Blizz's Totem Power recipe.
With 4 mana 7/7 thrown in for good measure.
With Dr 4s yeah.
Evolve isn't that cheap dust wise.
Who's what rare?
Nah not Evolve that's a fun? gimmick.
477 is common I think.
Totems and overloads for days plus bloodlust and some control spells.
Because blizzard is amazingly consistent with names.
!hs Flamewreathed Faceless.
That's actually just hearthhead's search fucking up.
For... idk even.
Also PS doesn't even tell us rarity thanks PS.
Anyway my point was if you want shaman wins maybe just hit up standard.
Right that's at least the win 1 part done.
Had to go the if you can't beat them join them and run rogue as they even out tempo the equiv hunter deck.
And ofc zoo is zoo.
If anyone wants 80g I have the Play A Friend quest active too.
I just wanted to post them and mention I have the next two updates recorded in raw format so hopefully next update in 48. Depending on Guava 'I love the bachelor' Moment. snrk.
Terrible terrible show.
Huh had no idea TDI is actually working as security at the Olympics.
MairBear a little smaller.
Yaaas fig rolls in the biscuit tin.
Anathema yuck lemon ones are the best.
I don't think those are even bought anymore.
They knew the only person who liked them left..
Urgh forgot I had a meeting at 12.
Had breakfast at 5am and was at the gym this morning hope the fig rolls can sustain me.
It's gonna use the whole hour 'cause Jon is gonna be there.
If he turns up that is.
Or turns up 30 minutes late.
Only 3 minutes late.
People are bad at muting their mics when not talking so much breathing.
'Illidank' ... of course play names.
I was expecting more Reaper Name type things but so far not really.
TIL that Arabic uses a somewhat different alphabet for internet chat / phone communcation.
I figured hey they just use arabic.
But no they repurposed latin.
Not a romanisation system actually just doing complicated things with the latin characters and numbers to stand in for arabic script.
Omfg that would be good.
You're not allowed to have cool things though.
Still mad Arms don't get Gorehowl.
They really should have just allowed people to have all the cool things we ALREADY had in the lore.
Instead of making tons of new ones.
Or at leat give people skin options for the cool things.
Well you can just transmog it to Gorehowl.
NOT THE SAME THOUGH.
This is great.
MoonWolf can you see.
Anathema so pretty.
I had to get rid of the borders and replace them with background colours for consistency with the rest of the UI.
I was so proud of that CSS _.
I do wonder why they decided against making this stuff bind on account c.
5 chest pieces on my warrior when my DK and paladin lack.
At least the transmog set piece is 3.
I am liking this revised take on 'crossroads/tarren mill raid'.
Better than the Hearthstone Version of crossroads B.
Game. Game pls.
Open both boxes.
Both contain the chest piece I don't want more of.
Your legion invasion on crossroads is filled with random mooks you don't know who's on your side maybe defias maybe naga maybe a fire elemental!
Sargeras is trying to go face against a Control Azeroth.
The bit that miffed me is you can't shard them at the garrison enchanter.
So much draenic dust potential.
BwaS At least they vendor for actual amounts.
Also among the gathered NPCs before Horde Side version of Broken Shore there's an undead runnning the AQ donations of wool/silk/mageweave.
The Good Old Days etc etc.
I should do that thing.
Alliance has a load of garrison followers inn recruits one of which is Bloodrose from Flintlocke.
Omfg kill me.
7 chest pieces 5 gauntlets 3 boots nothing of the other 5 slots.
I must have a walking throbbing vein or something because last week it was on my right nostril right now its on my right eyebrow v.
Or it just walked upwards.
This garona is WAY to kawaii.
Thats not a good garona look.
And Varian ? is way too unmarred.
But that doesn't bother me as much.
I mean that's the Warcraft movie.
Ah! Fair fair.
I should replay this game at some point.
Well its on pc now.
So pirate away ?
But I own a legit copy.
But your console to play it on is broken isn't it ?
Not on PC but I do anyway.
Nah its on xbox.
Didn't say a word then.
Bah. guess I will have to remove my sound card for a bit.
There's a community night for evolve tomorrow on one streaming site I follow.
But I cant run that without replacing my graphics card. and the replacement is bloody massive.
Takes like 3 slots.
Yeah I bought a too small motherboard so if the internal soundcard breaks for that I have to buy a PCI-E soundcard because my GPU takes up the only other PCI slot on the board due its size.
Also jesus christ did you hear the system requirements for mankind divided?
16 gigs of ram.
Actually no thats recommended.
8 gigs of ram minimum.
Yeah okay that makes more sense.
It doesn't look THAT much better.
That's gonna be interesting. Only have 8.
Maybe they just didnt bother optimizing at all again.
Im going to have to play with headphones on just so I don't hear my fans sounding like blowdriers to handle that.
Also I really should get around to preorder that game off steam before long v.
No never preorder.
Unless there is a public test like 2 weeks before launch.
Everyone on reinhardt only charging allowed. You can hold your shield up and stand still but only when charge is on cooldown.
Hm so I need to buy at least two 120mm fans for the front and side of my chassi. Granted I can also mount two on the top and one at the bottom but those seem a bit pointless.
Or I guess one top would be nice for more unimpeded air intake.
MoonWolf did you see Gnome's announced his Kung Fu Anime Wizards game?
There should be nothing I dislike about this idea.
Sorry if paywall.
I'll copypasta some of the pitch when I get back to a real keyboard.
MoonWolf karazhan out in NA.
But meanwhile here is a preview character.
MairBear we get it just past midnight.
So with the invasions going on.
Everyone is travelling to the shrine in Pandaria.
And setting it as their hearth to get around more quickly.
This is causing some lag ?
Just amusement to see the city of 2 expansions back being a main hub again.
Egh a lot of ppl have kept it their hearth point through warlords.
Stormshield isn't as full a portal hub.
I should really endeavour to finish DOS before Legion pretty much decides that no other games will be played for a while.
Now that my Co-op friend has officially given up on it and left me in the lurch xP.
<- space monster danger zone.
Its not a big deal though just don't go in without supervision.
Same unique fighting style they do.
GlennCuddlefish PANIC AT THE DOJO had the working title Kung Fu Anime Wizards until two days ago and I think that encapsulates roughly what it is about. The setting is Jackie Chan movies and Shaolin Soccer are documentaries. Fighting breaks out at the drop of a hat and nobody ever gets seriously hurt over it. Everyone you know has their own unique fighting style unless they're part of a school where 300+ people also know the.
Q So Panic At The Dojo allows me to finally play a game based off of Kung Fu Hustle? A That's one of my example influences in the second paragraph of the draft.
I'm kinda tempted to sign up for playtesting.
Go for it.
I am all about Team Skull.
Team Skull ?
Omg Alola Marowak is boss.
And Alola Raichu is supercute =3.
Meanwhile Meowth finally found the Dark typing it always wanted.
MoonWolf more pokémon stuff was announced.
Well smokey quartz... is a thing.
Bit high on the gimmick though.
Jesus christ RNG is against me today.
I've been trying to spawn a specific enemy combination in combat for 20 minutes now.
Fianlly got it a couple of minutes ago.
Aaand i'm caught up with SU.
I am having to beg Noelor for a shirt.
Because my character has no shirts.
And you can't transmog shirts if you're not wearing one.
Just buy the cheapest shirt off of the AH ?
Oh yeah the AH.
Boy this is awkward.
Oh wait it's not a bug.
Not sure why it goes to -3 tho.
Same no clue why it goes to -3.
Is Kara out in EU.
It's not right.
But otherwise this is the expected behaviour.
2 more hours.
Man that is fucking infuriating.
EU content creators get the shaft from Blizzard so much.
It pissed me off when I was just a player.
Now that I want to post videos on a website it's absolutely maddening.
...how is that not a bug?
Because it's doing the damage.
So it heals you for one.
So it deals you a damage.
So it heals you for one.
So it deals you a damage.
I'd forgotten how the succubus worked.
I think you just die if you control both.
Both having both means they both die.
Time to break some shore.
Sylvanas is an asshole.
That moment when your yogg tempo mage opponent gets you so invested into the endgame strategy you pull up a paladin secret calculator.
But then leaves the match S.
I love it when yogg mages get so invested into casting Even More Spells.
And then loose because they are not focussing on the actual goal of the game of hearthstone.
Which is beating your opponent.
Well they yogg'd when they were ahead when I was mostly top-decking plus hero power yogg cleared the board and they had a handful of cards left in deck.
One of which was an entombed healing wave totem P.
Watching a stream of Until Dawn.
Due to its nature a game that deliberately invokes every trope of teen horror movies there are equal numbers of boys and girls who are pretty clearly paired off.
But now I'm far enough in that I'm like Can the two girls who aren't awful not just get together and let the boys die?
All the boys are awful.
Also if i remember my horror tropes right that'd put them right on top of the list of people to kill.
The sexually promiscuous girl already died.
And yes was the first to go.
Wouldn't want to get original here.
Alright that's the karazhan prologue done.
I wish the WoW medivh was like this one.
Thanks to Mysterious Rune I just Duplicated Spellbender =V.
Noelor That happened to me too D.
Knife - Plates have Taunt.
Because of course.
Adventures have a Restart button below concede.
That doesn't help me switch deck but.
Also Heroic Chess is ....
Just did a Hc as Havoc.
Pretty fun if simple.
Hopefully talents up to 110 plus artifact? will add depth.
But Noelor depth is the enemy of accessibility apparently.
Noelor but did you feel like you were breaking the game ?
Punches my 7/7 with a 6/6.
And then uses siphon soul on the 7/7.
The feels _.
Because Olympics our team has been tasked with decorated the local area on the theme of Austria.
So today's quote of the day as chosen by me is from Franz Kafka.
But what is it ?
MoonWolf ein buch muß die axt sein für das gefrorene meer in uns.
Its not very olympic but its cool.
Well I picked it.
So it was never going to be very Olympic =P.
I duelled my friend on his healing monk as a tank spec DH last night.
Fight took literally 10 minutes.
Who won ?
I remember dueling another druid back in the day.
Good heals shit damage.
Why even try ?
It was very close a couple of times and I may only of won because my friend got distracted.
I'm hoping that was the technicians replacing the wire as BT did tell us we'd have 2 hours of outage in the next few days.
So that should spell the end of my odd internet issues.
Time for new and exciting different internet issues.
Every week with this offshore team brings new and excruciating experiences.
Since when is raichu psychic.
There should be a law against villains having instant escape methods.
Because villains are so lawful.
Yes but this is getting tiresome.
Beat villain he goes HA HA HA NO and vanishes.
That is the main reason I hate vampires in DD.
PatternSpider don't fail me now.
That is indeed a huge cock.
Lifehack don't wear a jumper when cold to help stave off exhaustion from bad sleeping habits.
This is great but I wish all the lyrics were like the intro.
Those renders are very pretty too.
Sigh really blizzard.
Watched the Horde side cinematics.
Can you do broken shore before level 100?
Minister what happens ?
Bum do I need to do it before Legion launches?
MoonWolf it's a direct follow up to Alliance so d'you know what happens there?
Anathema do you care about spoilers thereof?
I mean other than what is evident from the dhunter intro.
Long story short is Vol'jin died and named Sylvanas as his successor.
So she's Warchief now while Anduin has succeeded Varian as king.
I'm not sure that was a great idea or a horrible idea of vol'jin.
I mean sure put the one in charge who hates the legion the most.
On the other hand.
Its sylvanas ?
Also is this a thing now are we goign to just change the leader of the horde every expension ?
Do the taurents get a turn next time ?
Why stop now?
It was Cairne before he died I'm sure.
As evidence of how important they are.
I don't even know who the leader of the Blood Elves is.
...Sylvanas is the warchief now?
Its amazing really every time I think I cant hate warcraft lore more.
But I am almost certain nothing can make me hate it more than this.
Anathema Lor'themar Theron.
....Spend 20 minutes trying to get another set of xp mobs to spawn.
Realize I'm in the wrong tower.
The thing that gets me about the alliance version of Broken Shore is Genn's reaction.
So the horde were getting their asses kicked in gameplay terms all their leaders were down to 10% health or less. Sylvanas ordered the retreat.
Genn sees that as 'betrayal' because they withdrew first.
I dont think he ever actually saw the horde getting their asses handed to them.
Also there is nothing wrong with thinking the horde betrayed you.
Because 99% of the time that is true.
Nah all he saw is archers turning around from the ridge.
Look we need to keep the war in warcraft.
For some reason.
Its in the name MairBear.
Well given how good the crafting is.
It makes sense for the war to be that shoddy too!
I kid because I care.
Put the craft back in warcraft!
Put the World of back in World of Warcraft!
Put the thrall back in world of warcraft.
Not nearly enough thrall these days.
Put the garrosh back in World of Warcraft.
We just got the garrosh out of it.
Alternate time mode where he won't be evil this time oh wait no he is well shit how did that happen.
Firemage The ... level 100 human rogue.
From the renaming my pokemon the wrong thing school of naming.
Name all your pokémon ditto.
Name your ditto zoroark.
You can do that too.
ChaosSmurf how do prot warriors survive without charge?
The CD is awful on it though.
OH my bad.
Intercept can now be used on enemies.
I checked with Zac and he's definitely getting home on time tonight.
Yes its sfw.
That is some quality cosplay.
Fireland Warrior set Chestpiece normal difficulty.
Aaaand same set on heroic.
Since when is raichu psychic <- Alola Raichu is Fairy.
MoonWolf playing blackrock spire in WoW Nefarian is 10 times more suitable to hearthstone here than his HS equivalent.
Mocks every thing you do all the time.
I worked out why you can no longer pick a spec when you roll a new 100.
Everyone has all specs.
Nice new Uncharted 4 video.
My priest character name of 'Fortitudeplz' is now completely redundant.
A true shame.
Well survival is in interesting spec.
Blow enemies up make sure they keep bleeding fill them up with poison then flip the fuck out like a mongoose.
It doesn't sound very hunter-ish.
It's the old hunter with lacerate a bleed debuff to do like 40 dmg.
3kdps bleed at 100 in 650.
Haven't tried the new BM/SV yet.
BM getting chimaera shot pissed me off like.
Makes sense to me.
Shove all your animals into an arrow.
Shoot them at people.
It does more damage the more animals you have stored in your stables.
BwaS are all pets identical stat-wise nowadays?
Aside from spec choice mostly yes.
Some still have the bonus abilities like core hound heroism.
Those are BM-exclusive though aye?
Nether rays also give the heroism and are non-exotic.
After human civilization is accidentally destroyed by time-traveling crimefighters intent on undoing history's tragic deaths its up to a charismatic stuntman and his young companion to go back and painstakingly re-murder every single victim to set things right.
Also fuck its that late? We planning on starting on time or will I go make dinner quickly.
Think so starting on time or think so make dinner.
Think so make dinner.
Right afk for a bit. will try to get it done asap.
Going and doing any old quests and areas where things talk demonic is pretty good stuff as a DH.
I'm amused No Man's Sky lets you go far enough away from the center of a system to be drastically affected by floating point precision loss.
GlennCuddlefish ?
Lapis is the best gem.
Her expressions are so good.
Lapis is the most OP gem too.
Spotted on the gear of Russian Olympic air pistoler Vitalina Batsarashkina.
What a nerd.
<- Astounding!
The Go Go Posing Rangers Oh FFXIV...
Posing is important mairbear5.
Go away 5 what are you even doing there.
Oh my glob I'm about 20 episodes of SU behind.
Well they are short episodes.
Greg is not good with money.
OMG this show.
Tux pearl best pearl.
SO MANY FEELS in that episde.
And like 3 songs.
When did Jaina get white hair?
When Theramore blew up I think.
When blizzard wanted to update her model.
Is the real awnser.
Man she really haqtes the Horde now.
Gotta make everybody but Sylvanas look bad =p.
Maybe sylvannas and jaina should hook up just hate eachother romantically.
Ok so the ret paladin auto divine shield instead of dying talent doesn't work on falling damage.
Oh it does specify attack.
Oh man they should add a auto HS on dying talent.
MoonWolf maybe sylvannas and jaina should hook up just hate eachother romantically. - Do I even mention that it is a ship that exists? =p.
They are two attractive people in a work on popular fiction.
Ofcourse its a ship that exists.
Well since WC3 even I think.
Or at least early WoW.
My Ohime-sama Really Renaldo?
Oh my god! Pearl faces.
It's important to recognise Garnet's face at that exact same moment imo.
I missed that I saw Amethyst though.
Also this show doing that thing where it just casually plots.
Oh wait you might not be on the episode I thought.
There are so many Pearlfaces.
But yes plot has been off the charts this week.
That was the steven-broke-a-plate face.
Noelor today had the best Amethyst faces.
I guess I missed them.
Too busy looking at Garnet's =D.
I think there was only one Garnet face.
Yeah it was =D and lasted for the entire time she was on screen.
Or I suppose for Garnet it's BD.
Also a few eps late in reaction but Sadie still showing her best Heroic Mortal impressions.
You've ruined the ruins.
MoonWolf wait is that the burger button symbol?
Why is that in unicode D=.
Well its used for that.
But technically its the trigram for heaven.
Thanks china / i ching.
MairBear where/how do I valour my stuff?
Erm the ethereals.
I think it has to be the one in Ashran island but might be there's one near transmoggery.
Just finished a the? double bill one.
I think I shall pause my watching for a moment.
Ah but yuo're so close to the REALLY good episodes.
That was a heavy one xD.
MairBear> ethereals in shrine and sw also have the item upgrade.
Anathema you around btw?
There's finally an officer online.
This is ... really weird.
It's strangely fascinating at the same time.
Just so eery to watch.
He even cooks.
I feel oddly uncomfortable.
Fanfic authors will crossover anything with HP.
At least none of the are 100k+ word epics... yet.
MairBear I only realised when coming back that way but.
The quickest way to Azshara is via Hyjal.
Because the portals are still there from Cata.
Same for Tanaris now I think about it.
The real WoW fast-travel is knowing exactly where are the portals are.
And possibly being a mage.
Being a not-mage is so slow -.
Try being a druid.
They are marginally faster.
Procedural muscle strain animations!
Oh! Suddenly season 4.
Peri is best dot.
Noelor I see what you meant about the faces.
So many faces.
And caught up.
Sorry for being a cause of discussion prevention~.
Now how to crack magic mirror heroic. Hehehe... crack...
Okay heroic works VERY differently.
When any minion is summoned only the mirror gets a 1/1 of it.
Doomsayer works amazingly of course.
Corrupted healbots and zombie chows.
You get twice the healing he does.
It equals out.
I do like how only one week in a lot of people are in a hissyfit and dashing for netdecks after losing to adventure bosses once.
Some peole just want a cardback.
Don't really care about finding a way themselves.
Oh geeze he's nasty.
Rhonin Antonidas secrets out the wazoo.
If only purify worked on enemies right?
I did and kezan.
They work nicely cos he also loads up with the mad science.
Also you can do the boring thing and just use freezemage.
If the damn boss doens't want you to summon minions.
Yeah I tried to be priest do things that let me summon wihtout 'playing'.
Gonna actually try a mill deck for laughs. Since he seems to draw a lot.
Oh! Majordomo if I can survive that long!
Alarm-o-bot would f him up!
Oh man not sure if this is a legion change but boomkin surfing pose on pandaren kite is ace <3.
Yeah he never plays alarm-o-bot so while it doesn't totally screw him over. It does make his hand smaller.
I did that with the steal your rafaam thing just a deck full of cards that drew more cards and were terrible to play.
Sure you can't take his heropower away.
But you can make him shit at everything else.
Purify? Why would you play this card?
My friend was trying to extol that it wasn't That Bad A Card.
Sure if you really want a card to only silence your own minions i guess its an okay card.
But ... thats not a card i want to have in any deck ?
Went out of my way to collect pokemon with my busted leg.
I regret nothing.
Got off the car and what do I see but the silhouette of that electric rat.
How's the leg ?
Right leg for a change been limping on the left for a few weeks now.
I dread the day they realize they can gang up on me.
You'll have to get one of those old people stroller.
I refuse to do that.
I'd rather not go anywhere.
MoonWolf I feel bad.
I just went against a definite noob basic mage with ... well.. this.
It's far from a strong deck but rank 21 so I'm messing around with immortal paladin.
How are ivory knights treating you ?
Didn't do enough to keep me in vs a burst mage but that's cos I need more removal for when he antonidases B.
But on average 5 healing.
They work nicely.
It's a slightly more expensive healbot with a discovery more or less.
I mean i'd play that in a deck that wanted self healing.
Go save it then MairBear!
Looking at the Legion artifacts.
Arcane's looks real disappointing.
I mean it's Aegwynn's staff so that's nice but it doesn't do anything interesting.
Meanwhile fire gets Kael'thas' sword and the heart of his phoenix and uses them to throw auto-critting phoenices around.
Going to be fire for an expansion then ?
Yeah I already was because of the sword thing.
But looking at the trees it's just.
I was actually here to try and decide between hunter classes.
Also what do you mean Aegwynn's staff pretty sure she was depicted with Atiesh in basically everything.
Well there's that too.
Everyone would rather have Medivh's staff.
But Kadghar's hogging it.
Damn you kadghar.
We have to go find the staff Aegwynn used before Atiesh.
Stupid silent h's.
Who needs 'em.
The french and dutch by my understanding.
Ok so hunters the survival spear is nothing anybody's heard of but its main ability is cool.
Lets you flip out like a mongoose even harder as an aoe.
Our h's are not silent.
As a ch or sch its just a group of letters for a distinct sound.
Dps demon hunters' glaives are all about aoe for some reason.
Tank demon hunters' glaives seem cool though plenty of stuff with like extra damage that gets turned into healing more ways of carving out enemies' souls and eating them to turn into the demons.
Also if keal'thas' sword is fair game.
They should have used this bossfight legendaries too.
Oh hey field manual update.
That is certainly a mission name.
Noelor Aegwynn's staff iirc whispers and lores at you when playing.
MairBear its secretly an old god ?
I mean I guess she was sort of a warlock.
Also the Demo-lock offhand constantly talks.
Yeah that one makes sense.
It being the skull of the first warlock on Argus or something?
I know that the mage staff mocks you when you run out of mana.
MairBear so as an arcane mage ofthen then.
Every couple minutes yes.
Arcana mages might as well get their manabar replaced by an energy bar.
Or d3 Arcane Power.
^ that one.
All nice and swirly and purple.
I mean I *wish* it charged that quickly but.
D3 Arcane Power and WoW energy are basically the same the only difference is the recharge rate on energy is lower.
Omg this voice pack.
Also Jake/game/fix etc.
Nah its fine.
The voicepack is great.
Gfx this time actually.
Also the while the voicepack is great.
The ethics are not that great.
XCOM have never been nice people.
Going back to Sailor Moon Crystal.
Suddenly nuclear apocalypse of the future.
Sailor Moon Crystal Its a lot like Steven Universe only the Space Lesbians are not rocks.
There are not yet lesbians =<.
They're next season I think?
Well at least they are space.
Also the senshi are currently trapped by chirality?
I can't remember exactly what that is irl but I don't think it's crystal prisons.
I know its involved in some sciences but i have no real clue what it means.
Also Tuxedo Mask finally got magical boy powers beyond know when Sailor Moon's in danger.
What powers are those ?
A magical smoke bomb.
With effects about as consistent as any other magic in Sailor Moon.
Meanwhile in Sailor Moon is super insecure she is currently jealous that Tuxedo Mask is choosing to protect their future daughter instead of go on adventures with her.
Jealous that tuxedo mask is a better parent than she is even before they get space married.
It's racist is what it is.
Racist against purple.
Now his Toorit will die alone c.
BwaS the joys of procedural generation.
Weird WoW hunter fact.
Foxes are tank pets.
They're dodge tanks.
Anyway now I have to name all these pets I've tamed.
This is what happens when my dad picks hairstyle and name for his Night Elves.
Huh. so they are.
Haven't ran with a fox in yrs.
They're cute =3.
There was a time when they had a raid buff/debuff niche think for like atk spd reduction or something.
And it was then one of those 'well you wanna have this slot do you wanna bring this species or this other vastly inferior one'.
Was that no the debuff that *every spec of tank* brought?
I did give it the best name though 'AspectOfThe'.
Is that even still in the game?
Don't even remember what it was could have been before ultra-homogenisation continued further.
No that aspect went.
No more moveandshoot aspect c.
Well baseline and the HFC MM 4 piece say hi.
Only 2 of the buggers have ever dropped for me...
...yeah I got 2 pieces of set on my monk and 0 on my everything else.
I did some of the Raid Finder wings...1 time just to have seen the bosses.
Ok so I tamed new Gamooh-rah.
I think Squirtle.
Condoned. I have a Torkoal lava turtle from hyjal.
That name is reserved DAMMIT BLIZZ.
It's now Blastoise.
Was gonna say could grab the foreign names from bulba.
Guess who just rubbed their eye real hard after completely forgetting they'd put liner on earlier? =V.
I just need to name this lynx then I can go to bed.
You know what fuck it.
I'm probably not even going to use it.
Well this hunter here has a boar with a spectral model named 'Project Titan'.
Here's my actual main dps pet.
I'd link mine but too busy playing FashionCraft.
I think I'll be taking regular hunter through Legion first incidentally.
Rather than the demon variety.
Spear spec is real fun.
This probably works fastest for me.
Was that to mess with a tank's macros?
Works quite well indeed though.
Well I was kinda level 57 at the time on a very first run through in 2005.
Exalted.png <- that whole game is.
Well yeah I know that.
This land is peaceful its inhabitants kind.
Also thats a really fluffy tail.
So uhm do you know how long the average novel is. not a fantasy epic or anything regular old novel.
Somewhere between 30k and 40k words.
There is a fucking 3 MILLION WORDS weird every property in existance crossover wresteling fanfic thing.
3... million... words.
Fans are the worse.
Did you hear about the fans that chased a SU artist off of twitter because an episode maybe hinted their preferred ship wouldn't happen.
Second or third time that's happened by now.
Fans ddosing websites and sending theats to people who don't talk about No Man's Sky as if it is the second coming of Robin Williams.
Pathetic little shitweasels.
I pirated no mans sky.
Its ver pretty.
The procedural generation is quite good.
Its a boring game.
Its like they made all this cool tech.
But forgot to put an actual game in it.
If you want infinite worlds of replayable in-depth gameplay get a roguelike p.
Anathema i just wanted to shoot spaceships.
But NMS doesn't want me to shoot spacehips.
It wants me to walk around on planets and shoot lasers at the ground.
Some guy started a guide to Cataclysm DDA.
There are clearly roguelikes for that.
Anathema if i wanted that level of graphics i'd just play elite or something.
There is not a lot of space roguelikes.
Walked into work today.
Barely slower than the bus including average wait time at bus stops.
Cooked_Auto but where is the giant Rei head ?
WHo do you think is going to eat all that?
Cooked_Auto literally impossible task.
Besides shipping there is... gremlin d.va ?
Weird comics about how soldier 76 is everyones dad ?
Thats about it.
Warning spiders but Awww.
SunTiger also Reapfield and his amazing bag of shapes.
Or apparently beanper.
Drizzle? What? v.
Well that was fun. it took about 30 minutes to extract one tooth.
Even worse I will havet o manually submit my compensation form this time since the kela card reader was busted.
Uhhhhhh so the legion invasions don't care what level you are.
And give damn good exp if you aren't 100.
Apparently it got hotfixed in.
Annoyingly so too did a hotfix to allow the items to get warforged up to 710.
You know now I'm kinda bored and done with the invasions >C.
At level 37 I got about 40% per stage.
And the last stage was about 80% o.o.
How much time to finish those stages ?
Less than 15 mins.
Thats damn good xp.
Oh I see why I got about 80% It said 38.5k But I got closer to 60k.
Cos heirlooms aren't used for that equation.
But do still work*.
Yeah heirlooms are great for leveling that way.
Just tons of bonuses on top of tons chunks of xp.
Plus the monsters and attacks scale down to you so you don't spend time running to a corpse because something did an aoe that a 100 wouldn't feel.
Man I wanna reread Lord of Light again.
So right.
This says all moths can res.
My free moth I got for being a draenei cannot =<.
Its not mothy enough.
Eesh who edited this?
Yeah that sounds about medium to me.
Assault on Violet Hold - A remake of Wrath of the Lich King's Dalaran-based prison with new beasts. pls no Blizzard.
I liked violet hold.
The only problem was that it was hard to speed up with all the pauses.
But the idea itself.
Alola marth is fairy type and regular marth is fire type ?
I like that in addition to VH returning 2 whole order halls are in Dalaran.
I hope it's not a straight port of VH 1.
Mage and uhm...
I hate the wait for portals style.
No clue what the second would be.
In the sewer.
Not the place I would've gone for but sure.
Should have been Ravenholdt.
Was about to say.
I agree with Minister.
Or the SI7 headquarters or such.
SI7 doesn't work for horde.
Unless you put it outside of stormwind.
Forgot they kept it general.
And then its still a little awkward lorewise.
Yeah like Paladin is Light's Hope not Northshire which iirc the home of paladining in Azeroth?
Yeah and that'd have been fine if it wasn't for the horde getting paladins.
It's class hall not... Class/race or class/faction hall.
Which I mean they're now at 12?
All with their own assets.
I would have apreciated unique halls for the more unique combinations ?
24 would be awful.
Just like i wanted to see more racial buildings for the garrison.
Seriously unless your human or orc the garrisons were a little awkward.
Some stuff had racial flavour.
But like if you picked certain buildings.
I liked the banners and the guards.
But i wanted more stuff.
I wanted to plonk down a moonwell or something.
Or change the wall styling.
But I wanted more stuff WoD in a nutshell.
That would've made a big difference.
Without needing 500 differetn racial buildings.
Indeed the difference humidity makes.
Zarya in HotS?!
Also a german town in Overwatch.
Yeah it looks p quaint.
Watched the 2 mins of it waiting for it to drop like tf2 with manic havoc and the more it didn't the more I loved it.
BwaS instead you got a skeleton king reference.
Tumblr theme not awful on mobile apologies if so on desktop.
Acceptable on dekstop.
Not going to say i'm a fan of it though.
Also Alarak and seemingly a new Kerrigan skin.
For HotS that is.
Yeah but who cares about alarak or kerrigan skins when you can have a giant gravity gun.
True I guess but might as well just list all the news =p.
What a play o_0.
Anyone want 80 friendship gold for a childrens card game?
I could do with some of that.
That is a good gun.
AH GONE FUCK OFF GOLDVERSTEEN.
Also that needs to be a overwatch skin.
SunTiger omfg I beat magic mirror hc but I wish I'd done it this way.
This way ?
Just now I've defused all heroic bosses it's safe to trawl threads. And this one thread.... northshire cleric spam D.
Thats a neat idea.
SunTiger Deathlord pulled Aviana This followed.
That lightbomb could have fixed it.
If he had 1 more mana.
Oh man imagine that that aviana play happens and then the priest just plays lightbomb and your hand is gone and you're fucked.
Pls can has lightbomb back C.
Pls no can has. I never pulled one and epics are expensive to craft.
Neither did I yet but I still want priest to actually have a card that can keep them in the game other than purify c.
This spotify gigs in your area from bands you've listened to thing is dangerous.
I am going to be a lot poorer.
You can just not go to all of them.
But he must.
I checked if it was an onion article.
It's warmer than I expected it to be.
Still 17th alright.
I should fix Fellowship though.
I was once on the receiving end of anas boost on wrong target. as tracer. it was glorious.
Did you murder everything?
Everything there was to murder.
MairBear btw Do It For Her > Over Isnt It at least for me on a feels basis alone.
More feels in Do It For Her?
GlennCuddlefish I think if that had happened to me I would have immediately run off a cliff due to how fast I'd be.
Most feels possible in Stronger Than You objectively.
So many feels songs.
Oaky thats over reaction /r/games.
With us” Murray continued “when you're on a planet you can see as far as the curvature of that planet. If you walked for years you could walk all the way around it arriving back exactly where you started. Our day to night cycle is happening because the planet is rotating on its axis as it spins around the sun.
Not sure about the second pretty sure the first is true.
Except ofcourse the planet isn't a actual flat sphere.
So you can't really see the horizon.
According to the thread Planets do not rotate on their axis moons do not orbit their planets and planets do not orbit a sun. There isn't even a sun it's just decoration on the sky box.
But iyou take off you can.
I'm really not bothered they didn't emulate a physical solar system.
And did some calculation and a skybox instead.
Even when they made a big deal out the fact that The physics of every other game—it’s faked.
And theirs wouldn't be faked.
Okay they claimed something that they were not doing or ended up cutting.
But it doesn't MATTER it doesn't actualy make a real difference.
It didn't matter for those games it doesn't matter for this one.
I'm just enjoying the fallout.
This list.
SunTiger do you know if this reply is accurate? or used to be.
Anathema at one time tis was true i hope by now they've changed it.
That is unbelievably bad.
But really easy to implement first pass!
Although explains why they never bothered to add something like automatically moving items around if you try to take off a bag that has things in it.
They just asked whats the biggest amount of iventory space they'll ever need came up with a number and were done.
Ofcourse that didn't even hold untill the first expension i think.
Pretty sure they added more bank slots.
SunTiger game is still on right?
Tongith you will fight a big toothy grin.
SunTiger wowwiki doesn't mention it only a 1.5 change to require bank BoE bags to already be soulbound.
And hopefully get out of the prince of shadows' realm of holding.
Gotta rev up those playlists for that.
SunTiger I wish there was a wiki for this sort of stuff somewhere 'gross programming secrets from your favourite games'.
That'd be a nice way to loose an evening.
Or a work day p.
I love the Instrumental version of the ONIK theme.
Oh boy another space hulk.
But its made by the guys who made EYE.
And is going to be an FPS.
And you get to play as the Librarian.
Dear god what.
MairBear they really want to cash out on mgs quick and also ruin th ename forever in the process.
This is the only way that makes sense.
Oooh finally found a 13th age monster with mook spawn mechanics built in that i don't need to add myself.
I agree with whoever in my twitter feed said that looks like exactly the sort of dumb shit Kojima would come up with.
Yeah but he wouldn't then proceed to execute generic coop zombie survival.
You can do oh no zombies in the metal gear universe easy.
Don 't even need to go all AU about it.
Mgs 5 already touches on it anyway.
But you can't just make it day-z - again but this time you can have quiets haircut and the zombies have crystals.
SunTiger they claim it will still have stealth elements.
If by that they mean what L4D did with the witch then #FucKonami etc etc.
Crouch to make the zombies not hear you ?
Worgen.
Cooked_Auto are you having a game with us ?
Oh shit. v.
I honestly forgot the date.
Mfw our ongoing damage.
GlennCuddlefish I've got some pretty good news.
Is it karazhan?
Please be karazhan.
On one hand.
YES FUCKING FINALLY.
On the other hand.
FUCK I CANT AFFORD THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW.
It'll be a couple of months after launch.
Also that that feels like a really awkward username to have v.
Well this brawl is brutal. guess blizz doesnt want anyone to have packs anymore.
Shaman/priest co-op vs a nefarian.
200 hp full of board clears runs 3 phases.
Co-op brwals =<.
And you basically have 1 combo potential route to target all efforts onto in order to win and as soon as it gets killed you're basically fucked.
Ace enough to steal for twitter.
Damn Swoleby.
What I wanted to find was an upgraded sprite for Cait but that's not happening by the looks of it.
Different apperance might have her get over her secrecy or such after she meets her mother again. We'll see.
MoonWolf guess what I woke up to in my email inbox.
Going to give a scathing reponse or just ignore it ?
Considered just a No. but I'm just gonna ignore it.
Seeing Godspeed You! Black Emperor tonight o/.
Anyone else playing ?
Don't think so.
Yuo know i don't think sex is going to be great with that armored suit on.
Goddamn it Jade you split up the previous update into three but nooo not this one.
MoonWolf 66/66 mukla with windfury and word of glory. That is what I and my Brawl partner achieved.
I shudder to think what woulda have happened if the get 1/1 with every card minion had stucl.
Bigger than my 40 something minion.
Sadly that 40/something got blown up by the second phase bomb.
That thing is so unfair.
MoonWolf want to win a game for me at a point today? D.
MairBear lemme know when you have time.
MoonWolf I be ready.
Need some a warrior win might take a few shots depending on how it goes.
Want to get salty in voice?
Sec need to talk to my mom going to concede this one.
On ze voice now.
My feel disgustingly clean right now.
Technically he is capable of it.
No clue what he's saying.
That everything is terrible probably.
!note Noelor when you are adressing someone you have names you have titles and honorifics you have nicknames. what do you call the catergory of words for familial relations and stuff like that.
Well this is probably the most creative I've been with dinner for a while now. Chicken and Coleslaw sandwhiches with a dijon and sundried tomato mix.
That sounds pretty good.
Personally not a fan of sundried tomato but otherwise good.
Its chopped up sundried ones in this thrown together with some garlic honey and creme fraiche.
Oh god this Uncharted 4 update 3.
Hmm hmmmmm.
Good game doesn't need fixing.
The best game.
Wait what.
Behold horror.
Well I see the closure of overwatch hero league s1 has markedly improved the quickmatch environment.
Note to self If I plan on playing pokemon go for the love of gods eat lunch or breakfast.
Started to feel kind of woozy around 3½ kilometers when I had just eaten my last meal 22 hours ago.
I'm suprised you were not feeling woozy before you left.
Lots of coffee or something ?
I think I had drank only around a liter so far today.
Thats a lot.
Man the bastion short makes me wish all of blizzards games suddenly failed.
And the only way to save themselves would be to make a full length animated movie.
NO INTERNET NO.
Bird bastion is cute though.
I know Bastions are camping shitlords but sending him to the fucking Lake District is taking it too far.
MoonWolf so HS NA just told me Opera is open there c.
Still not for us of course.
4 more hours.
TIL Bastion has robot PTSD.
I think that was established before the cinematic.
I wish my overwatch didn't randomly not load games.
It certainly is.
Its not any good though.
Because nothing like that ever is.
The only thing worse than getting tweets liked by some porn phishing spambot is getting them liked by a gammongater...
Oh no not the gamergate boogeymen.
Well to be fair Gamon is the true hero of the Horde.
Woo got the mercy skin at least.
Now I just need the genji and zarya skins.
Hopefully I get them once my xp cap resets.
3 levels to go I think.
<- oh gods I only noticed it once someone pointed it out and now this emote angers me.
Cheetos dust on the gamepad.
GlennCuddlefish git gud >3.
Oops. won romulo/julianne on t6 first try with deck unadjusted from silverware golem 3.
Goddamn it Barnes.
I don't have time for your shows.
Hehe won BBW on turn 5 XD.
Dont you git gud me mair.
Also answers why everyone's sure they've seen her before.
Lol the paladin class challenge deck running quite similar ideas to what I pulled out my first guess.
Annnnd the warlock class challenge deck is basically well this narrow stars aligning archetype we thought up is pretty trash.
I've wiped twice as the warlock challenge.
Think took 3 attempts. second one I restarted a couple turns in.
Down to 3 hp at the end of turn 5.
They got a sunwalker two turns in a row on mine.
Here have this gimmick strategy.
Oh by the way our minion flooding is counter to it and the AI will target the cards you need them to not target ...
The AI that silences it's own minions cos it's a card it can play.
The ai that mortal coils minions above 1 health then bane of dooms the same minion that's still above 2 health.
I wanna see the 'moroes is playable when barnes spawns him' highlight vod. wonder if that'll be a thing.
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
!note Noelor If you were grinding for a legion invasion staff apparently there is no point. Mages can ONLY get a 1h wand or 1h sword.
There are simply no caster staves on offer. or offhands.
Aaaa I'm getting so slow in my old age.
Reactions times measure in the 200 range now m.
Well that explains it.
I was wondering why my phone keeps dropping from flat surfaces.
The back of it has almost no friction even a slight wind pushes it around.
Any confirmation of Briskle tonight? o.
We've not had a noelor in channel since yesterday afternoon.
Looks like the DE 2 embargo lifted 10 minutes ago because i have 3 news pieces for it in my rss feed.
All posted within the last 10 minutes.
Noggenfogger Elixir + Whole Body Shrinka' toy is amazing. D.
Did you take advantage of the post-invasion minimal discounts?
BwaS of course!
So the guy behind Madoka is apparently working on an animated Godzilla movie.
There is not enough eva's in this.
Well you also had gunslinger stratos out of him p.
Yaaay! I bought the new swirly ball!
Give us swirly ball or give us death?
!note Noelor.
The sarlac pit of pokemon.
I have a language question.
Also this !note Noelor If you were grinding for a legion invasion staff apparently there is no point. Mages can ONLY get a 1h wand or 1h sword.
When you are adressing someone you have names you have titles and honorifics you have nicknames. what do you call the category of words for familial relations and stuff like that.
Mother Father Uncle etc.
As a form of address?
But i was wondering and it was a rather large group of words.
Figured they'd have a name.
MoonWolf see the problem there is you're putting too much logic to English.
I think depending on language and relation.
They would fall into any of the above categories.
Like Mum is just a name in english neesan is either a name or honorific in japanese.
But i meant english.
Or at least western european.
Noelor likelihood of Walri?
Likely but let me poke him.
So there's an undead helping durnholde orcs with the power of THerapy.
You can't fix mental issues with a few heal spells.
One good thing thats come out of this sylvannas thing good mental help.
Note by MoonWolf from 18 Minutes ago <- *snrk*.
The authors twitter/tumblr is spoiler central.
But if you ever finish the books you should really follow one of them.
Because they are great.
I need only one more starter in pogo now.
Well and then their evolutions of course.
Anyway starting dinner now hopefully will be done in 30 minutes.
Shit last time I looked at the time it was 1703.
No wonder I'm hungry.
MairBear I see they patched the ilvl of the gloves.
Did they? o.
The arcane blast gloves?
They were hotfixed to 700.
It might display as 685 on tooltip but equipping and comparing on character panel has it equal.
MairBear not being rude already unplugged my headset to go make dinner.
Fuck forgot to turn the heat on.
Is august in finland like that?
Meanwhile at the pub today.
No but heat is kind of needed while making mashed potatoes.
I like that pub.
MoonWolf Noelor.
Is that some parts of the heroic set matched with the normal mode set?
Dob. yeah but the point is some hats are cool on other but my goodness they are not good for panda.
MairBear here you are.
Same hat on a race with better heads.
It's fine Bambi's Mom is a Mei-playing scumbag.
Za ai ui en.
Goud zout and bout.
Threatening lethal on board beast druid part-trades to then go face double savage roar leaving me at 10.
Oh what's this double quick shot in hand with 2 bodies on the board plus hero power.
Also I put fucking barnes in that deck and drew both my highmanes turn 1.
Noelor.
And then venom was a good boy.
!note MairBear omg they patched the ilvl of the arcane blast gloves but not the warforged version.
Up or down ?
The arcane blast gloves were much lower level than the legion invasion gloves everyone spent all week getting.
So they hotfixed it to the same ilvl.
But I got a warforged ie higher ilvl version of the gloves on my hunter and they're actually a lower ilvl.
I survived my run.
I'm not suprised.
It was hard I got a medal though so that's pretty great.
That is pretty great.
Like 5 of the obstacles weren't open due to dangerous chemicals or w/e in the ater though.
In th emiddle of england?
It was on active farmland.
MoonWolf omg the priest in latest rage orc.
MairBear have not watched that yet.
Oh correction on that they nerfed the whole thing back down.
Noelor thats what i expected to hear when i asked.
I hadn't been onto other characters yet.
Ah finally get the week's tavern brawl pack.
That took you long enough.
Nice to get a partner who has also figured out the strat 3.
I'd left it alone since wed p.
Hmm this freeze mage in the NA preliminaries running Reno. With 19 unique cards total in the decklist.
Really planning on using that reno late.
Anathema if you haven't seen it yet I have a feeling you would really like Stranger Things.
MoonWolf heroic Crone has Twisting Nether.
So you ahve a time limit B.
Play a shaman andn make it reincarnate ?
Apparently there's like 3 in the deck.
Noelor on my to watch list.
Continuing the trend of me being a complete idiot.
Locked myself out of the house again last night and had to sleep at a friends.
No keys with a neighbour ?
This i Gold.
I love the games where you get elimination gold as reinhardt.
Enemy team was doing it wrong.
That and I was on a roll. but mostly they were doing it wrong.
Forgot how Sideshow Spelleater worked in the brawl.
Now we both have totem power.
Anyone want 80 golds in the hearthstone?
I wouldn't mind so much.
Give it to BwaS needs it the most.
You make me sound like a charity case.
Well its not my intent.
But if i can give someone whats absically 4 HS cards i'll give them to who needs more HS cards the most in my eyes.
You play a good chunk you don't have nearly as many cards as MairBear or I do.
Therefor in my eyes you get them.
Watching the overwatch tourney from gamescom. feeling massively depressed seeing how beautiful the game looks when it's not run on a potato.
Those are terrible dice.
Keep scrolling for the warrior ones.
Those are also bad.
What's the domain for nyaa?
Those dice are a cute idea.
But I don't think I'd ever use them.
Basically the problem with them.
Terrible to roll.
.se it was.
Yeah .eu bounces you over to .se anyway.
Noelor May I interest you in the Kirby Café soundtrack?
It's apparently the CD they sell at the Kirby café so.
Where is it anyway? Tokyo?
Yeah somewhere around there.
Starting season 3 of sailor moon.
Everyone is crushing on a guy I'm faily sure is a Sailor Scout.
There's something elegant about flamewaker into a firelands portal.
Jupiter's new attack is A+ we put a dictionary in a blender.
Jupiter Coconut Cyclone.
Are there any coconuts ?
I think it was coconut coloured?
White and brown ?
It was the first episode of s3 so like the last third was new transformation and attack scenes for each of the senshi individually and back-to-back.
Thats a bit much.
It's to be expected.
Yeah but every season the team gets bigger.
By season 5 you'll have an episode of nothing but transformations and attacks.
Jesus christ why wont the one skin I want drop.
Pretty sure I've opened around 40 loot boxes now.
MoonWolf oh Sailor Chibi Moon wasn't in e1.
Just the core 5.
Erm so Yogg just broke the HCT tournament rules by playing A Light In The Darkness into Arcane Giant a week before it was tournament legal.
BwaS disqualify yogg!
Sailor Moon's new finisher involves draining power from the future.
Which probably won't every come up but.
Also I have no clue what Sailor Uranus' gender identity is.
Draining power from the future <- this seems irresponsible.
Noelor she's not just a butch lesbian this time around ?
She they whichever.
This is complicated if there is two versions.
So far their civilian identity is a boy.
Who is dating Sailor Neptune there's a chance I have them the wrong way round incidentally.
And everyone else was crushing on ?
Yes he's a very attractive boy.
Who drives race cars.
Although i guess a lot of the plot is who are a bunch of sailors/who is sailor moon crushing on this time.
Still pretty femme as Sailor Uranus though.
It'd have been interesting if they had one sailor just show up masculine transformed but i guess that was never on the cards.
Maybe intentionally androgynous drop the skirt tights or something instead.
All Sailor Scouts so far wear skirts.
Too iconic to change i suppose.
Only Tuxedo Mask wears trousers.
Magical girl/whatever uranus wants to identify as in a tux i could also get behind.
The Holy Grail has shown up.
Thought you were watching sailor moon not fate collide.
I'd watch fate stay sailors.
Isn't that what the Illya Magical Girl series is? =p.
No i'm pretty sure thats fate stay lolicon bait.
Exactly that was my point.
Seriously that series got creepy maybe if they were trying to run that with girls OUT of puberty it'd be okay.
I'll give you that.
...GW is going to stream one of their gaming events. What the hell is going on here?
They are loosing money and are trying new tactics to fix it.
Well if you want to be snide then sure you can say that.
Damn the Opera was trivial on normal but harde is not so much C.
You can't silence your minions out of being 1/1 so there goes my purify idea D.
Its a bad card MairBear.
Digg still exists apparantl.
It's a cyclone shoved into the shape of a coconut.
Then thrown at the enemy.
That makes no sense good job SMC.
Sailor Venus' new attack is a sword that shoots out chains of beads.
That or she's just making Naruto style rasengans.
She has not yet used the sword part to hit anyone.
I ike the swords why are they beads ?
Well the element associated with the planet Venus is love.
Love = beads ?
And as I'm sure you're aware the physical manifestation of that element is beads.
Ah yes i'd forgotten i remember now.
A boy with a crush on Chibi Moon gave her a present.
This boy makes bad life choices.
Oh maybe I should give a present to that sad girl I met the other day.
And/or is evil.
One of the two.
I think he's just a bit hopeless.
Oh sweet this month is Arceus.
This show needs to stop shipbaiting the pair of ...11-year-old? girls.
Setting aside that Sailor Moon is still 15-16 herself.
For todays dinner experiment I made cauliflower gratin.
GlennCuttlefish sounds good.
Big fan of cheese on cauliflower.
Oh jeez latest HCT contestant waves to the webcam and goes full Twitch when a pyro/equality/solemn card draw pulls off.
He picks up a keyboard and copy pastes emotes?
No he poses at his webcam mimicking 'PogChamp'.
Twitch sure is awful.
Cooked_Auto that stand is terrifying.
Learn how to do anything downside is that while you are doing it you are drawn in the wikihow style.
Still don't know how they have an original style that is so TERRIBLE.
It was available?
Its true nobody else was using that style.
Dob is the cringe guy that Rooftrellen player? Cos that was....
So I went on nyaa to get different subs for Jojo 4.
Because I'm getting sick of Crunchy's renaming.
MairBear> yeah that's the one.
Especially of stands their names aren't even band/album names!
I didn't want to assume based on looks.
But I wish I could be surprised.
I hate when my prejudice is proved accurate.
MairBear got my DK to 70 today btw.
So she's safely past BC.
Also switched to blood.
Is it better to chase the big ones or just the small mobs still?
Yeh invasions feel a bit buffed again. just took priest through all of mists in 5 invasions.
Because tank specs do so much better in this scenario.
I try to get groups out on their own and the un-named elites.
You do also get xp in the completion bonus though.
Also monks get their 50% buff to exp daily/every 10 levels quest D.
Also died 3 times to this stage 2 boss.
Because a hunter got 'delirium' and spammed barrage.
Hah facebook offered me a look at my advertising profile and a chance to prune it.
Millenials is a category of adverts.
I hate everything.
I'd show you examples of Millenials adverts but I'd have to disable adblock.
And nothing is worth that.
Meanwhile in my feed.
Someone got bored and has been going through the profile picture history of a couple of our mutuals.
Liking every single one.
Back to 2012.
Fb has considered these all relevant to me -_-.
Facebook is still terrible.
Yeah my fb seems to have evolved to beat adblock now.
Get all the suggested posts from crappy fanpages flogging tshirts when I never used to.
Yeah there's now native advertising ie posts promoted by advertisers.
In addition to the traditional gazillion sidebars.
Hard to block risks blocking things you want to see.
Noelor I got my old mage off Mair's old server.
Fire is The Fun.
Probs the funnest of the three rn yeah.
Even if it doesn't have a snare =<.
What's wrong with frost nova.
Yeah but you get to throw phoenixes around Noelor so i think that makes up for it.
MoonWolf not yet we don't =<.
Oh right weapon talents.
ChaosSmurf snare as in frostbolt or Slow.
For now we just get to insta pyroblast like 4 times every 2 minutes MW.
Thats just a really big fireball though.
Its not a phoenix.
Is there anything as awesome as flare from ff14 in the game yet.
Wow spell effects have always been low key.
Compared to asian mmos.
Looks like the dance contest was good this year.
So it seems.
With the power of the Internet the world will be as one once more... I'm ok with this cult.
*suggestive eyebrow wiggle*.
Demons are clasically summoned with software.
Just any SMT game.
This is SMT DeSu 1.
But even SMT 1 had demons summoned/managed through a program.
There is an npc that repeatedly upgrades your demon summoning program so you can do it better.
Devil Survivor was fun D.
So the scaling spiked suddenly in the invasions....
Aoe now 2 shots me.
Thats going to make using it for leveling a lot harder.
Yeah D Just means I can't actually contribute to some of the big boss types.
Just enough to get exp and then rtf away.
Flight path to next invasion.
Realisation we rebuilt sw park but stonewrought dam is still bust.
I mean there's a difference between planting a couple of lawns and recreating a dam.
Can't read forums when you're dead.
Would have used Mad World myself.
Check the inspiration one as well.
Oh apparently Kara is coming back as a 5-man instead of a raid.
But with 9 bosses.
So I might actually see it properly when it's relevant.
Noelor oh? will the legacy raid not be doable then?
Maybe they'll shift an entrance for the old raid.
Or make it a selectable ?
Not sure pretty sure you jsut can't do old UBRS now because the entrance takes you to the Cata dungeon.
New TDI LP up btw.
Guess he could stop trying to worry about someone trying to blow up the Olympics at last P.
Thats a ... nwe game.
A genuine new game.
Didn't know TDI could do that.
Yeah? They got rid of the 3 month rule a long time ago.
Yeah but TDI just doesn't really do new anyway he's always years behind.
Or playing ps2 era stuff.
So? I mean he does play other games.
Are you shitting me.
Sausage Party has been out in the USA for 10 days but we don't get it in the UK until the 2nd of september?
Why do you even want to watch it.
I think it looks fun.
Seems the Vue doesn't book films more than a week in advance oh well.
News just in Blizzard is full of giant nerds.
Really ? shit. didn't see that coming.
Guess i'll have to stop plaing their online childrens card game.
Thank you for the chillest background music album.
Noelor was that the playtest that just made noise on my windows notifications ?
That's actually the preview for Scion/Trinity's system.
But thanks for reminding me.
Aha so that what is was.
Waaaaaaaaait a second here.
This CANNOT be a coincidence.
Reference for those who don't have eva music memorized.
I feel like I recognise - ah.
The movies also have variations.
Honestly those are better.
But this is the original.
I'm not seeing it as quite WTF level.
Pretty sure its the same composer.
Just checked it is in fact the same composer.
But including it is a pretty direct homage regardless.
MoonWolf The movie is directed by Hideaki Anno and composed by the same composer that did NGE. It's not a conincidence P.
I had missed that Anno was involved in that.
But yeah Shirō Sagisu did the music for Shin Godzilla.
I need eva vs godzilla in my life.
Would you be surprised that there was some cross promotion stuff with NGE? P.
Godzilla 1.11 You Are Not A Dinosaur.
I'm sure you can find some if you look around.
Coming out somewhere around 2030.
Nah that's too optimistic.
I was about to make a Still before NGE 4.0.
Interesting. the skybox change for legion invasion affects the underground CoT portions.
That's gonna be a reoccuring joke for sure.
I just went on wikipedia to check the year of Akira.
Although Neo-Tokyo is set to host the XXXII Olympic Games...
Had definitely forgotten that part.
I rewatched Akira a couple of weeks ago but had forgotten they were the ones set to host the olympics next time.
This is so painful doing invasions and helping kill big things.
Then 10% or less on the boss it targets me with a random one shot.
Basically I should just do what everyone's doing. Poke it once for credit and then mount up and leech.
Feels bad though.
Yep I was getting the random one shots on my priest at 98/99 window still.
It means bring a ranged spec basically.
And tank is sill risky you just don't get oneshot.
I'm finding vengeance more fun than havoc anyway though.
I'd thought you'd prefer to mobility of havoc.
I don't think I'll be bothering much more. Got one to 80 will strive to get past BC content on a rogue but then ehhhhh.
MoonWolf honestly the leap's enough.
And the actual fighting rotation of vengeance is more interesting for my money.
Especially as havoc's dps is actually *dependent* on wooshing all over the place like a DBZ.
Yeah that i'm not a fan off.
I like the ability to move when i want too.
Not having to move even if i don't need too.
My DK is pvp-enabled.
Don't remember doing that.
Not the temporary kind from a pvp zone ?
I'm in Dun Morogh.
I guess I hit someone last time I was logged in.
No map.
How could the map ever be wrong.
Note my hp.
There seems to be a nonzero amount of it.
But you Are a deathknight.
So you know.
Not ruling anything out.
Clearly they wraith walked to kharanos.
73 seems a good level to call it.
The last active skill in the DK spellbook is at 72.
Really thats boring as shit.
Talents at 75 90 100.
Still 38 levels of not much.
I think those odd skill buffs in Draenor still maybe?
I thought they were removing those.
I'll let you know when I get there I guess.
> Malchezaar drops Gorehowl.
> I'm on my druid.
I see what you did there TDI v.
Its a classic!
Legion is out on the 30th aye?
Haven't heard anything to the contrary about that.
Oh well wont be playing immediatly arranged a social event for that evening.
Well starting immediatley is usually a bad idea anyway since you'll be stuck in queues and so forth.
Woah I have 14 days holiday left this year.
And not a lot of year left.
Time to cash in then.
Top result on the trending searches on my phone today hormone replacement therapy.
And why are you googeling it?
Depression related ?
No no as in I tapped the search bar on the home screen on my phone and it shows trending searches.
Must have been in the news recently.
Another example is 'jenna coleman good morning britain'.
Someone famous talking about it.
Our teamcity VM is dead again.
This happens way to often.
Our IT are not good.
Took tomorrow afternoon off o/.
So I have 14 instead of 14.5 days.
Anathema your IT is exceptional.
How much are you laughing right now?
Anathema just a little bit.
Well that final boss took a while.
It's still down was promised it would be back up before 12.
We have some promotional video being filmed at the office today and tomorrow I said we should all just sit with our hats on and use hackertyper.
We'd be so hip and cool.
Only to people who have no clue.
Well the company is seen as a nerd company so I suppose even the sales office should live up to the name?
As one the few nerds in the office I have the responsibility for keeping up the image -.
Red hat seen as a nerd company? no way!
So they say.
Not true at all.
My lunch today digestive biscuits and a handful of caterpillars.
Like the insects?
Very responsible choice.
Was it tasty?
Not really much of a taste tbh.
I got Geoff and Mike to try them too.
Little crunchy on the outside mostly chewey though.
How is it prepared?
They are smoked and dried when caught then to cook them you rehydrate them. These ones were fried after being rehydrated.
Anathema sounds like significantly less tasty shrimp.
Got a bag at home so I'm gonna get a couple of recipies to try.
MoonWolf well my friend said she didn't cook them properly so we'll see p.
Fuck it going to see if wireshark can help me with this issue.
Anathema the fuck is going on that you need wireshark ?
MoonWolf I dunno certain requests just hang indefinitely no exceptions thrown.
Think I got it now though.
Okay that makes some sense i was really confused why you'd need wireshark to debug a site.
I couldn't find the traffic I wanted not sure if it was captured since we force SSL etc.
Also that has a complex UI.
Its a complex tool.
Dammit there is nothing in HTTP to say include this header with this value when you redirect when sending a 307.
I think that might have been intentional ?
Yes well it makes my work awkward.
Now I gotta use cookies or something.
Or url parameters.
Why do you need to do logic with redirects ?
Need to add ability to hide the headers and footers somehow use case embedding inside a mobile app browser tab thing.
It needs to work with redirects becaues if you go host/view/open/someView we redirect you to host/view#open/someView so that further navigations to other views don't reload the whole page.
So url parameters will be awkard too ¬_¬.
Awkward little combination of requirements.
I hate web development.
Idea add a /withoutchrome/ section to urls -> add a before request pipeline that looks for that rewrites the request url to remove it but sets a flag -> add an after-request pipeline that resets the url back at the end.
Ugly but then a 307 redirect that adds headers isn't exactly clean either.
May not be possible either though it seems Nancy doesn't let you modify the request object.
Ok best thing I can do is look for the header if it is there set a session cookie. In the client side look for the cookie and if it exists hide the content I need to hide.
Session cookie should survive redirect.
If it doesn't you have bigger issues.
It still doesn't work once the page is loaded due to everything else being XHR |.
But it does work.
Thank fuck it works.
My finishing line photo from the race is in the 1130 to 1200 folder which means I did it under 2.5 hours o_0.
Teamcity died again.
I was waiting on a buiiild.
The fuck is wrong with that VM teamcity itself isn't that unstable i mean i don't use it but i don't hear anything about it being crashprone.
It is recent.
IT blaming older version of VMWare.
I knew Asura's Wrath was anime as all hell. But I didn't know it was THAT anime.
You don't know the half off how anime yet.
Its going to get so much more anime.
Well that I know.
I just didn't expect the way it was put together.
I wish blizzard would say something about this issue.
I am not the only one who just can't randomly load overwatch games in time.
Whaaaat? DXMD Now Avaialble?!
It might be.
I didn't pay attention.
Yeah came out today.
Its whole robot parts apartheit thing is a dumb thing.
Steam says so. I didn't realise it was this imminent. Tought it was one of those really late 2016 or early 17.
You really need to pay more attention to things p.
It's not my fault time keepr running away D.
Firelands Portal needs to stop summon doomguards for the enemy >C.
“This will bring a wide selection of PlayStation exclusive titles to Windows PC for the very first time including entries in the Uncharted God of War and Ratchet Clank franchises as well as beloved PS3 games like The Last of Us and Journey”.
PlayStation Now the streaming service that lets folks play select PS3 games for £12.99 a month is coming to PC tomorrow in the UK Belgium and the Netherlands.
Value for money right there.
Man the new Kharn reveal on Warhammer TV is kind of cheeky.
Wait you can pay wow time in wow gold now?
What is this black magic and why wasn't I informed.
Not that I would have played since I was occupied with trying to get overwatch skins until now.
Er yeah it's been a thing since erm sometime during warlords.
First content patch maybe? maybe earlier?
But yeah it's legal gold selling one party buys tokens for cash slightly more expensive than regular month sub.
Then flogs token on AH to other players. gold cost has some supply/demand economics formula behind it.
EU prices are nuts.
Omg someone reminded me of a wasn't vanilla better thing.
When your tank missed a taunt because he didn't have enough Spell Hit.
When you wanted to fly across two or more zones and needed addon automation to connect the flight paths for you.
There are some things I don't miss from vanilla p.
So all 6 invasion sites are always active now on a 2 hour rotation still.
Just in case RNG and availability had meant you hadn't gotten the 6 site achi yet.
OH GOD Khadgar is broken.
Went over to him and he filled my chat log with a greeting line repeated over and over.
Isn't it Greetings fellow seeker of truth he pops?
Or something like that.
Mid-health warlock v zombie chow. drain life mortal coil gets the regen life taps.
MoonWolf ...have you heard Priest of the Feast's summon words?
Yes i have.
Funnel cake meme will never die MairBear.
I can't even.
Funnelkuechen sterben nicht.
Odd. could have sworn I used to have at least 70k on my characters.
Guess I must have spent it just before I quit or something.
So first glenn felt the pull back to overwatch and now wow?
Funny how those things go.
Thankfully I'm immune based on the sheer fact I'm two expansions behind and poor and stuck on a dumb other servier v.
World of Darkness in a nutshell.jpg.
I promised my guild I would resub to wow if they announced khara.
Logged into Garrison my desk has been replaced with an elemental.
Oh hey Khadgar.
GlennCuttlefish Blizz called your bluff I guess.
Completed the elemental tablet thing today.
Still generating runes though.
Anyway now Khadgar wants me to kill Blackhand so maybe I'll never see the Garona stuff.
Maybe Khadgar should get off of his but and do something himself.
He's too busy grinding his reno-yogg-cthun-nzoth-freeze mage to rank 24.
Yeah that'd take some time.
MoonWolf Blackhand is a warrior running fatigue.
And Khadgar just does not have the patience.
Went fishing through artifact details last night.
Noelor that's normal blackhand! He's his own wing and is relatively quick o.
Got a really pleasant feeling seeing one of the MM hunter appearance lines you can take has echoes of rhok'delar.
Not even normal*.
Similarly SV spear has a lok'delar style 3.
MairBear oh yeah I got LFR was viable.
I'd forgotten the last bosses were their own wings now though yeah.
That's aight then.
Yeah you can get Garona and unlock you legendary ship quests without having to do anything in a group.
Also all 6 invasions each cycle is going to rocket my DK up.
Getting an easy half level per.
I'm running out of steam to do them >.>.
I'm basically only doing them on hero classes in tank spec.
Gearing 4 100's and levelling a fifth did it for me.
On one hand I feel I should do a few more on monk to try and get a weapon but on the other hand.... legion weapons.
Alternating with racing my mage through endgame.
MairBear yeah I considered grinding a bow for my hunter but.
I managed a wand.
It's pretty horrendous.
But at full upgrade it was 10 ilvls higher than my fully upgraded engi crafted gun.
Also the new addition to the quest chain was underwhelmingly short B.
!note Cooked_Auto srsly though I unironically love Asura's Wrath.
Mm I won't really be doing it on all the gang like last week's.
It's short enough I won't mind.
But like I'm just not touching the paladin any more.
Didn't find her that fun to play in prot as compared to hero tanks and don't fancy ret.
So that's 3 100s plus the DK.
Ret is pretty wanked up compared to wod.
Don't know what that means.
Just the usual shuffling of spell roles for not much reason and relative weighting to the resource.
Mirror image seems to be back in fashion.
Every mage has it for turn 1.
Enemy mage down to 3 cards in hand 0 in deck. At 24 life plays reno.
Rather than waiting till they were close to death...?
I mean the kicker is she even had ice block literally no excuse to play reno vs a 30 health paladin that's shown to have all the heals.
Whoops forgot to reconnect after the internet died on me v.
Noelor You can play it via PSN by the way.
Or I could plug in my PS3 =P.
Or you could do that.
How should I know you have one of those on the top of my mind?
This is going to be fun...
Of all the things I was not expecting Panic at the Dojo to be a tactical grid-based RPG.
Ok then let's see.
!note MairBear if you're interested in joining me on thursday evenings to playtest Panic at the Dojo a kung fu anime-inspired tactical grid-based RPG from the brain behind Fellowship ping me confirmation as well as whether you'd prefer a fantasy-esque or modern setting.
!note GlennCuttlefish if you're interested in joining me on thursday evenings to playtest Panic at the Dojo a kung fu anime-inspired tactical grid-based RPG from the brain behind Fellowship ping me confirmation as well as whether you'd prefer a fantasy-esque or modern setting.
!note Cooked_Auto if you're interested in joining me on thursday evenings to playtest Panic at the Dojo a kung fu anime-inspired tactical grid-based RPG from the brain behind Fellowship ping me confirmation as well as whether you'd prefer a fantasy-esque or modern setting.
So noted also pinged also indifferent on setting.
Noelor either is fine still interested.
MoonWolf what is your opinion on LightFang as a FFXIII ship?
I'd be behind it if it didn't look like Fang and Vanilla were a perfectly content couple on their own.
ChaosSmurf SHIELD is the Stephanie McMahon of comic books I swear to fucking god.
Sons are the worst.
One of these days I will have to enter my door into the inter transylvanian creaking championships.
Left my room and that was a good 15 second creepy creak.
One day you'll open it and there'll be one guy in a cape going I am... Dracula. I bid you welcome.
C_A knowing my friends that is a real possibility.
Hmm… A swordsman in an unfamiliar land not quite sure of what is going on being pressed into becoming a guardian for a selfless teenage girl’s pilgrimage to a distant forbidden land on a suicide mission to ward off monsters. I… Wait… Fuck… I know this one….
This is getting weird.
Log in wow bazillion achievements.
Don't you feel accomplished?
Apparently I had hoarded quite a few transmog items.
Instantly got both chest and weapon transmog chievos.
GlennCuttlefish they went through every quest you've done on that cahracter and added every item you could wear on that character to your transmog backlog.
GlennCuttlefish but do you have Captain Rackmore's Wheel!?
Shield that looks like a ship wheel.
MoonWolf the most shocking thing is 846 packages depending on something that does literally nothing.
Because node doesn't have a clean set of requirements per project.
It has massive dependency trees.
Because most node users are fucking amateurs.
But without the careful super curated by comparison work like the debian packages.
Hm guess I'll be stuck with UH for a while.
At least leftpad actually did something |.
But yes something.
This is also partially caused by js not having anything like a functional standard library.
Or agreed upon defacto one.
Fuck I hate people.
On a thread about Pokemon go and whether using maps was cheating or not.
I consider the location-locked nature of the game to be a central feature that contributes to the entertainment value of the game. I don't consider the location of the Pokemon being hidden a central feature at all.
In reply to what about GPS spoofers.
Gps spoofing is cheating though the twitch plays pokemon go thing they did it was a nice idea.
I was fine with the pokemon locatins thing because they broke their own ability to really look for the damn critters properly for a good long while.
Strengths good at cleaving. Easy to learn. Weaknesses Everything dont play this spec go play UH you moron.
Was reading up on current deathknights.
Frost is terrible atm then?
Frost is always terrible in the end.
And I just dont like playing UH. So I wont be playing DK this expansion.
Just doing the pre-expansion things rolling a new character come the patch.
41 pages of capes.
And nothing to wear.
Wear no cape then.
Do you have Loremaster or something?
He dimmed the lights took off his shirt and did a dance projecting the silhouette of his chubby beer belly onto the screen. The told them It'll be just like this except we'll use a pretty girl!
Err. just checked.
I actually do have Loremaster.
Oh wait the collection tab shows everything you could possibly have.
Odd. I should have some of those tabards.
Well time to go through all old alts over level 30.
Maybe undelete some reall old major ones if you can.
I dont think I have deleted any major ones.
Log on to old lat.
Guild message of the day Bring on the cataclysm baby oh yeah! D.
Cataclysm'd the guild.
Some guy just sent an email AND a skype message saying 'please do the code review'.
And a comment on github.
Log in to alt log out.
Or try to but this is a PVP realm so I get ganked in that time.
Anathema and you of course replied with 'I'd gladly do the code review since you asked so nicely!'.
You know me so well.
Goddamnit Jaina besoothe thine bosom.
Nope too busy trying to beat sylvannas and kerrigan in being queen bitch.
While jaina needs to calm down this seems like a bad move.
I guess I'll read the chargen parts of PatD notes as I skipped through them last night for rules.
Game definitely on tonight?
Noelor looks like regardless of the level I take Japanese will start on Thursday. BUT won't start till week 2 of October. So if you can do the playtest before that I'd be happy to join.
1221 wear no cape then <- almost always the correct choice regardless of how many capes you have.
And don't mind setting so long as crazy things can get happening.
MairBear it's a playtest so just through Sep seems fine.
MoonWolf Buried Treasure brawl.
The discover at every turn.
Indeed. Win 5 brawls suddenly looks more abandonable.
We had a good brawl so we have to have a really slow shit one right after ?
TIL Shoop da Woop is an item in Isaac.
TIL Isaac is a terrible game.
For terrible people.
Read with enthusiasm.
So hearthstoners hate blackheart just as much as heroes players then p.
What a POIRIT without a litter TRESUR.
I mean I say that but half my DBM sound alerts are running HotS voices.
New player in hwfrp hasn't played since before I was born o_0.
Now that is old.
Pantry spider 3.
Its pretty cute.
Decisions decisions. to farm invasions or to make dinner.
Oh its already half past that was an easy decision. more invasions.
Wear no cape the <- unacceptable. how will I achieve maximum bling without a cape.
Butr but.
Bah its that late already.
Cooked_Auto if it makes a difference given the lack of preference either way from anyone I'll probably have Panic be a revisit of the Mahou Legend setting.
I'm fine with people letting off fireworks. But I'm not sure what a weekday in the middle of august has attached to it that's fireworks related...
It's your birthday tomorrow!
I don't think the locals here know that though.
Or do they?
Depends how local.
The Vivec's Regalia set Vivec's Cowl Vivec's Head Vivec's Index and Vivec's Muadra.
Set bonus employ the power of each setpiece in order to... CHIM.
It's a type of book.
I couldn't think of any actual item beginning with I.
Mairbear mairbear so what do you call an enlightened chimneysweep from japan?
I'll tell you anyway.
CHIM CHIMney CHIM CHIM Cher-ee?
MoonWolf like a turn after you left Tirion came out.
Its not great.
Well this brawl is a disastrous cavalcade of idiots coining out a 2-drop and going face when they really really should be getting punished for it but RNG is a complete cunt to you.
Vannila was better Exhibit # 28 Where is Mankrik's wife?
Hey let's give your opponent a 5-cost king krush while you have the offer of a flame imp! BALANCE.
Bloody fucking typical. go to wild casual to finish off class daily quest instead of this stupid brawl and win on turn flipping one.
Finally got brawl pack.
Think my opponent pinged out but w/e.
Leaving that the fuck alone.
Yeah I had the 5 wins quest on my log last night.
Was real close to throwing shit out a window.
I never keep that quest.
I do them.
I think I'm about to kill my opponent with Flame Trap.
This invasion thing is pretty good xp.
Yeah there we go.
Thats 50 levels so far today.
GlennCuttlefish mairbear claimed it was better before.
It got back to betterish.
Not as good as it initially was though invasions are near permanent now so it evens out.
In week two it was nerfed and of unreliable presence.
MairBear we're discussing Panic on mumble and I'm playing about with tokens at.
Cirnobaka player names intensify.
Mylune shows up in the Druid quests and it is The Worst.
ChaosSmurf you mean the best I assume.
Basically are Noelor and I going to love it?
She's in resto and guardian so far.
Stop Staring At My Noobs.
Vortex Dragon is definitely a Boss stance.
Just by name or als ogenerally ?
MoonWolf both in name and mechanics.
Black holes black holes everywhere.
Oooh that one.
With uhm. power ?
Noelor given that no fellowship tonight would you be terribly put out if I slept in as I know you wanted to do some Panic things.
MairBear what level's EPL if you remember?
Also pinged to Noelor a while ago but repeating given that no fellowship tonight would you be terribly put out if I slept in as I know you wanted to do some Panic things.
MoonWolf Eastern Plague Lands.
Oh wow stuff.
Sorry not in a wow mindset.
I can do Panic things with MoonWolf and/or Glenn if you need to sleep.
I love doing panic things.
GlennCuttlefish did you try I am Setsuna in your binge of jrpgs ?
Any good ?
I liked it.
World could have been more fleshed out imo the soundtrack seems to be one of those love or hate things.
I'd like to know how does wow run worse than overwatch.
Well that explains that.
Huh neat.
Well the Retribution Paladin artifact quest is disappointing to anyone who though people would stay dead.
Which people specific do not stay dead ?
Gonna guess Tirion.
Retadin artifact being Ashbringer.
C o r r e c t.
Quest's pretty dope tho th.
I was not expecting b.net streaming.
Mainly because it seems pointless I suppose.
It only going to fb makes it a bit flat.
MairBear but WHY.
GlennCuttlefish Noelor the strategy was to get the disease on us bounce it to the ghouls once and then just spread out again so it never hops from us and bounces between adds.
...Goddamn it Geop.
Why did you tell me about the toy mair.
Now I have to level my druid.
Why your druid ?
Highest horde I have.
Garnets voice actor can reach quite high when she wants too.
Oh wow. took a minute for the model to load meanwhile I was just leisurely strolling through the air.
Finally reached 1600 dust.
What are you crafting ?
Also could you win a match for me ?
Not the way today's been going.
But I could try.
I think Sylvanas.
Or something more specific for one of my current decks like Fandral or Gormok.
Dear freeze mage remember to include your kill combos.
Yeah i was expecting you to die after the alexstraza.
But then there was no burn at all.
Jesus christ.
I'm in a similar spot to noelor. dithering over a double call of the wild craft or saving for an nzoth.
I have no good advice for that.
But i can tell you i love N'Zoth.
I ended up crafting Fandral.
Oh wow gnome already replied to the Panic feedback.
That was fast.
Two Phoenix stylists is a combo I hadn't considered and yeah they'd be invincible huh.
They would be because they get WORSE as the fight goes on.
You can easily get them to th epoint where they regenerate whole healhbars every round.
Banshee's Wail will be fixed next draft so will Misfortune's Style the one Glenn took then never bothered entering.
The thing where it rubbles edges ?
We were right about traps being very dangerous but that is intended.
Thats abusable as hell.
Traps are extremely dangerous and mainly exist to force whoever you trapped to take their next turn right now or suffer for it.
Setting aside phoenix.
It's basically the same as Slasher style.
Anyway playtesting successful we contributed stuff.
Does tihs link work?
The conversation has been deleted.
Sopoo no it does not.
The stuff for edge falling is good.
Yes makes a lot of sense.
Also I'd completely forgotten about Iron tokens' movement option last night =P.
Thats okay i'm perfectly good with repeatedly throwing god and his personal guard of angels out of his own throneroom.
The progression thing seems interesting.
One of the fragments of argus hasn't despawned.
So it's just.
Fucking everyone up in Crossroads.
I can't escape.
Fragments of argus?
The rolling boulder things one of the bosses spawns.
My fragments - for argus!
Video games.
Wow invasions.webm.
That is so accurate glenny.
The skipping on Everbloom is so extreme now.
So mad about Everbloom.
ChaosSmurf worse than before they patched a few of them ?
So you do the skip to the first boss.
Then from him you skip behind the 3rd boss to go to the 2nd boss.
Everbloom you were so good before we found out your walls are terrible.
Do any of the skips still take longer than actually fighting bosses?
Probably if its not working right.
Bearing in mind most heroic bosses take <1 minute now.
Also I forget who's playing Legion but is anyone maining a healer?
Well it snot me.
And i think Mairnai isn't monking.
Enjoy your pubbie healrs.
Mairnai doesn't believe in mains.
Actually yeah if ana's playing with us I hope he does main paladin.
Because that'd be 5.
Also unless something changes my mind in the next two days I'll almost definitely be monk though I will be picking my dps artifact up first.
However I will be spending my upgrades on the healing item when I get it.
Mairnai are you saying you don't have 10 level 100's ?
I think he's over 10 by now.
I'm not some scrub.
Well i'm pretty sure you can't complain about Noelor's comments re believing in mains then.
I mean I only had two 100s for the first patch!
Blizzard should just give us dual classing.
Instead of dual speccing.
But yeah 12 on dragonblight one of each class. Then a horde alt to see the horde side. And then two that i levelled up in these invasions and finally the pre-ordered-legion bonus.
Noelor because of demon hunters no.
It is so pointless trying to do invasions properly now.
Noelor did you decide for sure what you would prioritise? o.
As Glenn's doing mage.
Could use a melee DPS.
ChaosSmurf monk healers are melee dps D.
Has anyone worked out how to move the frame.
The talky frame.
The talky frame ?
You rememebr in War3.
People would pop up at the bottom of the screen when talking.
They added that.
It's really nice and useful for making quests more cinematic.
MoonWolf with the same totally not-synched lip waggles too.
But it's not in a great place on my UI.
ChaosSmurf hunter is melee.
But now we also need a ranged physical dps c.
I'm gonna side marks.
I don't think we had a ranged for warlords.
What is Malygos doing in this warrior's deck.
Being the essence of magic.
Ranged physical Noelor.
I mean that's literally only hunter.
So I guess not.
But also it's not super necessary.
You don't understand WE MUST BE PERFECT.
ChaosSmurf so we need a physical ranged dps who can also serve as an offtank and cc-bot.
I have traps.
But yes my plan is to pick up the bow as well when 2nd artifact becomes available and try to keep at least ilvl parity.
I wonder which relics they each use...
What profs do mages use Noelor.
Literally anything other than smith and leather.
Does boost level secondary profs too?
If you make a fresh 100 you have first aid I think.
Lemme log into my hunter.
Incidentally the relic answer was overlap on storm and blood but sv uses iron and mm life.
Also I think the bm gun also gives you an artifact pet basically.
So that's... nice?
Oh no fresh 100 doesn't even get any secondaries.
If you power from 60 to 100/90 you get more stuff I think.
Because my first aid is 1/700 which just means I found the book.
Mining/engineering it is.
I think you'd want to at least learn the secondaries.
And if they don't get boosted oh well.
Yeah doing that now.
I get 600 mining engineering and first aid.
With a 90 or 100?
100 gives you 700 in those three.
Damn the new draw distance though.
Flying through Tanaris like oh look sky spires and cat-taur statues in the distance.
Dumb wow fact standing on the roof of an inn gives you Rested but flying above it even a meter off the roof does not.
Does flying EVER give you rested ?
Probs in capitals.
You can see the tree in duskwood.
WoW just got a lot smaller ?
They upped the draw distance by.
3 times or something stupid.
Would anyone like 80 HS gold.
I'll take 80 gold.
Let us battle.
To the death.
I am on mumble if you would like to join.
Hooray for money.
A shameful performance.
I blame it on the wraps i was eating.
I want a wrap now.
Pulled chicken some salad with bellpeppers and a lot of garlic sauce.
I miss chicken a lot.
Why are you missing chicken ?
I had friends over for burgers and then for dessert had coffee and apple pie with vanilla sauce.
I'm going to claim moral food victory because mine was healthier.
Making chicken at home is harder than other things.
Uhm... not that much harder ?
You and i have very different views on how much effort to put into cooking i think.
Everyone on ladder is playing these hunter decks.
I miss chicken because I decided to be a vegetarian.
Though not enough to change my mind.
Noelor thats a much better reason to miss chicken than CS's.
Goddamn that's good looking.
That inquisitor looks ... much to normal.
Nice dreadnoughts though.
Why... is an inquisitor reporting a a space marine.
Of any kind.
Pretty sure thats not how that works.
No I think that's an Inquistor as well.
I mean he doesnt look like an Imperial Fist marine if anything.
The spider mount.
Is seriously fucking chilling.
Look at this shit.
He immediately left a mountable area obv.
But jesus christ.
Haha holy shit the hidden affect on the Survival hunter one.
Maybe a tiny bit of spoils ?
I don't actually super care.
I mean it's just wow.
Noelor did you see gnomes preview of the next draft with colours ?
And formatting presumably.
Where was that?
On the twitters.
Also what's his handle again?
Spelling that from memory would have been a fucker.
You can find it if you google twitter gnome fellowship.
Whoops Its All Lesbians Panic at the Dojo has no straight people in the art just a heads up.
The cutest reaper.
Aaaa cant decide what I'll level next.
Level a Druid its like leveling everything else all at once.
You get healing tank range and melee dps.
Spent yesterday leveling a druid.
Pity its the wrong faction.
Did you use your 100 boost.
I'll save it for when I actually need it for something. Might use it on a druid actually maybe paladin.
ChaosSmurf I actually typed it correctly then went back and made it say that.
Kind of tempted to make a gnome DK for some reason. But I wont.
Which part makes me a monster.
DKs are good to hundred boost cause they start nearly at 60.
Whats wrong with gnome DK.
ChaosSmurf doesn't that make them Bad to boost.
Because you ar eboosting less levels.
Nah cause if you boost from 60 you get free prof levels.
Speaking of which MoonWolf I have another code.
Which I'm offering to you because I want to play with you 3.
Don't want it.
~ mythic+ MoonWolf ~.
~only with wow~.
The only good thing about this expansion is Kharazan and their attempt to do something non boring with items.
Which is offset heavily with demonhunters and basically everthing else.
I also like this level scaling invasion event.
Also they reintroduced terrible terrible talent trees.
I like those plus increased attempts to explain the reasons things are happening and a move away from group finder.
This time on items.
I mean seriously.
Nah tbh the mythic 5-man stuff sounds p dope.
Well you get everything so it's the good parts of the old trees without the bad parts.
I can agree that the talent trees are a bit why even bother but ahh well.
Some people will like them.
I guess i've looked behind the mmo curtain too long.
...I seem to have lost a death knight.
Its all meaningless numbers that go up exactly at the same pace blizzard paces content numbers.
Meaningless progression no choices to be made.
So's life though.
Maybe without the Blizzard part.
I'm not playing a videogame to experience life ?
At least ff14 goes this is the next tier of armor its better than the previous tier its stats are the same but 5% higher.
Procs ? no fuck procs they do shit all if they math out to the same result.
I mean fair.
I'm sure I was supposed to have a level 80 DK somehere.
>it's just the same old shit.
>the only interesting bit is Karazhan.
I mean I don't fault you for disliking it v.
Noelor still going through that backlog ?
Make the word for “to ride a horse” etymologically related to the word for “coconut.
Are you playing tomorrow night Noelor / GlennCuttlefish.
Might be exalted but I think Janos is moving house.
I'll be leveling something tomorrow at least. Can do dungeons as well if you feel like it.
Discovered stormwind gate 4exp.
Congratulations level 87.
That seems like an awful point to quit on this char back in the day.
A whole 4 experience.
Gravelord Nito reminds me of the end of Inside.
Slightly less body horror ?
Less flesh certainly.
Also configured more or less as a human being.
Instead of a formless limb katamari.
I dunno I just started watching Vicas' video.
And it seems like a formless bone katamari.
Skulls at the top ribcages in the middle legs at the bottom.
Maybe I'll level a paladin next.
Haven't actively played one in a while I think.
If my paladins gear is anything to go by last time was in WotLK.
Because it looks like a death knight?
One of these weeks I will get attumens mount.
ChaosSmurf I assume you are fine with leveling alliance tomorrow?
I dunno if I wanna solo tho.
Solo as in just us?
Oh do you mean before Legion comes out.
Invasions and stuff.
Its not out tomorrow is it.
I thought it was tue/wed here?
It's tue at 1201.
As in 00.01?
Not tuesday noon for some reason.
1101 for us Noelor.
Playable somwehre around noon the next day though.
It's playable around 2-4am.
Because everyone else goes to bed.
Anyway tomorrow I wanna finish up this mage on Horde.
Though I might do that tonight because I need to ruin my sleep schedule anyway.
Once Legion launches I have to take a bunch of video stuff while I'm playing which will make partying up ~a pain~.
Just do it with ut.
And then if we're on mumble I can glorious bomb all your videos.
That stupid wrestling song has been stuck in my head for 2 days now.
Nah bobby roode's theme.
And after that.
Have you heard Shinsuke Nakamuras.
Also do you know if Broken Shore is good XP.
Have the option on this mage now.
Yeah nakamuras is graet.
Not sure if I think the full version is better the intro goes on a bit long and doesn't quite fit.
Can I get a port to old dalaran.
Err sure o.
Wait horde or alliance?
Your belt is um.
Not very happy there.
I think it's part of the chest piece.
That song in latest SU is pretty top tier... damn.
Noelor PLOT TWIST.
More like plot... un-twist?
The twist is that the twist isn't a twist at all!
Wat a tweest.
MairBear Muradin says By my beard! in Hearthstone as well.
Who else's beard is he going to swear by ?
I don't know how you hadn't noticed this about him.
There isn't that many muradins around in HS on the whole.
Muradin in general in both games has always said that.
And MairBear only noticed like this week.
And got mad.
MairBear you must have a very low WIS score.
Because you are terrible at noticing things.
This came up because I'm getting it 1/turn in hearthstone rn.
MoonWolf why you do this to me c.
MairBear its important to know your own strengths and weaknesses.
MairBear that was.
The best losing turn.
By his beard.
Ok gg but FOR THE RECORD.
Noelor look at your opponents name.
Just look at it.
That turn order.
I am also on mumble with afk-smurf who may have fallen asleep hard to know.
Brb 30 mins for mumble peeps.
A friend of mine found the thread even.
ChaosSmurf the bearded axe.
Direct link. ignore the UI CBA to organize it yet on new characters.
The power of moderation.
MoonWolf don't click on this Glenn.
MoonWolf still getting a 404 on that one just so you know.
HOW did you manage this ChaosSmurf.
What did you dooo.
Has he started echoing.
Obs is not good at sound.
Can't hear us.
It shouldn't be that hard to set OBS up with sound to avoid looping or echo.
But then again it was a while since I used it.
The gayest dog.
The worlds most fabulous pigeon.
Some PDX nerds hi play DD with Abbadon every Sunday. Today he handed us copies of the book ten days in advance of the release because he is cool and rad and this comic is cool and rad. fucking jelly.
Abbadon is the author of K6BD.
ChaosSmurf that is p rad.
MoonWolf my bus ride to my parents' was 20 minutes or so so I made about 3 different characters for Panic.
Mei an approximate Samus and an unfocussed support role called The Alchemist.
Mei is dual focus Archer/Winterblossom Akimbo Blaster / Frozen Shadow for l-click Crosshair Power for r-click Glacier Watcher for walls.
Samus is Gadgeteer with Mega Power Whip Shadow Rocket Blaster.
And then this support is Potions/Glacier/Halo + Zen/Watcher/Support.
Oh gods Quinns linked on SUSD.
It's ok I shut it immediately rather than scroll through it until I lose consciousness.
Noelor yeah you need to play wow before yo udo that.
The deathknightiest transmog.
Noelor ChaosSmurf.
Noelor ChaosSmurf.
Hah i win by 2 C.
Did I miss anything important?
Legion launched ?
Can't play till tomorrow evening.
Butts the danganronpa 2 OST on spotify doesn't include the 8-bit versions.
I'm sure torrents can solve this problem.
Not gonna pirate music at work |.
I am at least that professional.
How good is that don't read comments spoilers.
Relatedly I'm almost finished danganronpa 2 now it's so good.
Definitely one of my top games.
Noelor I'm on again now was away for youtube things and so forth.
And here I thought maybe he's gone to bed like a sensible.
After only being awake 10 hours?
My mutant skinless cyclops lay-priest is probs gonna be executed in WHFRP.
I can't imagine why they'd do that.
Technically just fully transparent skin but basically she looks like a Titan.
~MoonWolf i can't imagine why they'd do that - yeah can't imagine why.
It's OK I get to come back as a desert witch.
Why not a dessert witch?
Trade Cooking isn't a career skill.
ChaosSmurf You think you can use your special journalist investigation skills to figure out if the Stormforged Valarjar are in fact a reference to Warhammer Age of Sigmar?
Little specific for my skillset I feel.
Lol why are you so mad?
MairBear face.
Like some sort of wolfskull.
What the shit wow.
To anyone who has alts at 100 log into all of them at least once. Rested EXP does not start accumulating till you do.
Nomi why do you only sell recipes I already know /.
As a leatherworker I've been asked to talk to a mount vendor about how to make better saddles.
Noelor 8 juggernaut star is going to be very pissed once he gets a body back.
She also cut his fucking halo in two.
First proper coffee after a looong time.
What was inproper about the coffee you had ?
MoonWolf just not had any.
MairBear its pretty cute.
Omg the eagle ghost.
Ghosts are not supposed to be cute Noelor.
Though they totes are.
But it can fly.
I have a flying ghost and it is the best fucking power.
Fuck all other artifact bonuses.
2/4 of the new zones are really vertical.
For instance the first thing to have killed me was a fixed level 110 demon on the summit of this mountain with a windy path up to it.
That would be hell as a ghost normally and I got to nope up past it.
So much better than my pet farting lightning for 5% damage.
Oh while I remember and have the page open MoonWolf.
From comments in the vicinity of recent events of where I'm up to flooded district they will be doing the DLCs.
This is weird I feel like my seat is tilted 45 degrees forward.
Anathema does it have a tilt setting? I think mine did.
It is but it's more like 10 degrees was the effects of hunger I think I had lunch now.
Me irl.
I mean there's a bunch of bugs.
But the servers have been fine yeah.
Question for the folks in here with Opinions on cooking.
Milk in scrambled eggs y/n?
Scrambled eggs no in general tbh.
Noelor I add milk I know people who do not.
Well I'm going to try it with soy milk.
And see what happens.
I'm not sure this is a good idea.
But good luck.
Porridge works fine.
But yeah we'll see.
On the topic of food actually.
I mostly add milk because you can cook them faster that way by putting the heat on max and constantly stirring.
Here's a British food item I learned of last month Samosa Butties.
Butty is northern english for a sandwich made in a bun.
Urgh fuckin' UPS.
Put a note through my letterbox to say they'd missed me.
Y'know while I was in the flat.
Spoke to Zac he's *definitely* internetless for at least 2-3 weeks as opposed to ¯\_ツ_/¯.
So Briskle's going to take a detour.
Oh good I'm now talking to a tree.
Noelor didn't think scotland was that internet deprived.
I have been sent to Hel.
Would anyone here be interested in a biweekly/monthly RP ran on an available sunday afternoon?
You know the guards in Dishonored love to pee everywhere?
They finally found a position to see it from the front.
In like the penultimate mission I think.
Important videogame science.
And the sound spike.
Of the reaction.
Anathema depends on what.
Though also a little ^.
Specifically WHFRP set in the far north starting in a Kurgen village so mildly pro-chaos with Choas Dwarves Dark Elves and mutants all being viable characters. You'd be working for a warband chief expanding his domain.
Except without weird houserules this time.
I can give it a shot.
Unfortunately I have IRL games on sundays.
Apparantly i alraedy own this.
Apparently you just get it for free if you have the previous games.
So apparently there's better 13A sheets available now or somesuch.
With power cards.
Or maybe that's just something I've missed entierly from what we already have v.
MairBear MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish ^.
MoonWolf still on for tonight?
Support for modders through new modding options and a fully integrated Steam Workshop.
Quality of life features like higher stack limits quick item pickup a larger stash and a speed setting.
Depending on your unicode.
Aha didn't render for me.
Well on your font.
Guess tahoma doesnt support it vOv.
Consolas is apparently mine.
And it sees like three 3x2 lego bricks.
Although calling those Lego bricks is almost generous P.

Now that I actually start working on this again I keep wonder if this will actually work at all /.
Gilnean soldiers being good at physics.
The crafted leather set minus the helmet which is from a quest.
Grab a shirt?
Noelor Gilnean soldiers being good at physics - Oh I see what they're doing there. Well done.
The top google result for 'antonym' is a website suggesting synonyms for it |.
Also why are you googeling antonym ?
Offshore devs wrote something called CustomRichEnumType so that invalid enum values in the DB will be null instead of throwing an exception and asked me if the ame was OK.
It isn't but I couldn't think of a better one so looked up synonyms of various words to try and think of something better.
Ugh that name is terrible.
This whole situation is terrible.
Anathema I'm sorry.
Ftrbzzs none of them have replied or commented at all on the email I sent yesterday telling them to do their workflow better.
Anathema refer to that email when they bug you again.
And keep at it.
My transmog rn.
ChaosSmurf you transmogged it.
Its your own problem.
Is that your class hold ?
Your unit frames are ugly.
>textured health bars.
You're just mad I have a better beard.
Maybe if ChaosSmurf actually mainainted his beard.
Instead of just sort of having it parasityze his face.
Other languages are awful everyone should just speak English so I don't have to make all UI text in the framework translatable.
Anathema elä ny viitti.
Juu iha kummia mielipiteitä jäbäl.
Dit kanaal begint veel to fins te worden.
Anathema enkä rupeis skottiin väittään et muut kielet o kauheit -.
But we luv you anyway anathema <3.
MoonWolf Krzysztof Dzięcioł.
Why did we have to be on a realm named after a zone instead of a person.
I keep looking at my friends list and thinking Why's Mair in Dragonblight?
Noelor because they ran out of person names.
And they don't reuse names.
Dragonblight was a launch server they totes had person names still available.
If it was a launch server that actually makes sense.
Because it was a zone that wasn't in game.
It was I played on it then!
Taken from the RPG books or w/e.
Noelor I'm tempted to go to Dragonblight.
Which was another category.
It was in WC3 I think.
Stupid inefficient human body.
Yeah amazon was all out.
Here we are a mod just to hide that bar across the top of the screen.
And turn it into a minimap button.
You get whole squads as a single follower now ?
I currently have command over four champions Rexxar and people you haven't heard of.
And then recruiters who get me squads of archers who are ok and trackers who are better.
But by default MoonWolf it places this bar across the entire top of my screen.
Who thought that was a good ui element.
And it overlaps my own broker bars.
Hence this mod.
Maybe juuuust maybe.
Blizzard should just add their own broker bar.
And broker managed bar elements.
So they can integrate neatly.
This is not the world in which we live.
This world sucks.
Also this addon doesn't even work.
This one does!
I mean that *is* cute.
But also why?
Because you can.
For Smurf.
Anathema you're being sought on mumble.
And simply Banana noises.
Just followed up on a skinning world quest.
Next step Darkheart Thicket.
I'm so sorry.
ChaosSmurf what was that mod called for world quests?
First boss of panda raid #1 down in 20 seconds.
10 man only but heroic.
Conclusion 10 man heroic is childs play 25 man might cause the occasional struggle but all 3 of the starting raids are easy enough in MoP now.
Though there is one boss that is impossible to solo so I can't kill him or the empress in Heart of Fear.
Just bring someon eelse.
Aye the mechanic is odd but I imagine 2 peeps could destroy the boss.
I wanna play a Warrior but also play a healer.
Be a druid ?
MoonWolf that isn't the same at all.
Petition blizzard for dual classing.
MoonWolf just want a 4th Warrior spec yelling at people to ignore the pain.
With spells like Rub some dirt on it and Walk it off.
Call it The Morrison.
Also a bit of a disc priest / WAR warrior priest heal-through-dps.
MoonWolf Noelor Jewelcrafting quest name.
I hate everything.
Haha to get an extra skin Arms warriors hve to find and duel Saurfang. RIP.
Noelor sorry you had to witness me be bad at fatigue.
I was watching Steven Universe >.>.
MoonWolf is there a Pillars RPG yet?
Noelor this NPC just pronouned it as the Ledger Domain loung.
Am about to see a movie about vulgar anthropomorphic food.
MoonWolf Noelor.
Smug little otter applauding his own arse-scratch technique.
In jade's absence the xcom 2 lp thread has now devolved into japanese haiku's i mean actual haiku's in actual japanese.
I must say the Asura's Wrath LP is going places in terms of the game and the commercials.
Icy Veins proves to be a totally factual and professional outlet.
Listed in the strengths of Demonology warlock Spooky.
Snek school.
Noelor random heroics do give you those coins for the heirloom pieces.
Now they just need to add a breadcrumb to the Broken Isles.
Because I couldn't start it in IF last time I looked.
Any universal breadcrumbing through adventure guide shift-j?
Noelor ChaosSmurf I will need to do dreamgrove today as this world quest is offering an 840+ chest piece.
MairBear did you manage to complete your mythic last night ?
It sounded like it was quite challenging on the whole.
All 5 bosses in only 2 and a half hours.
The first and last boss were the trouble the others were something we could do well.
I think one of them took 2 tries because of a bug but the rest were one-time-success.
You gits and your level 110 characters.
Ok from a brief read the maths of potion crafting in WHFRP just doesn't seem worth it.
This is not suprising.
MairBear also everyone died on Fenryr except ChaosSmurf.
But yeah mythics are p good.
How did the tank not die ?
Warriors are OP.
MoonWolf stacking bleed too.
It's a boss who jumps all over the party at random every so often.
Yeah reaches points of being unhealable and if I die DPS are doomed.
And has a fixate too.
Also I guess I slept around 8 hours because that plot mission is still in progress.
Thats a normal amount of sleep.
Why the suprise then ?
It's probably the first time in about a week =P.
MairBear did you mean Darkheart for that world quest?
Shitty Corrupted Forest Dungeon.
I too have an 840 reward there.
I feel that given the lack of clarification we can do it in normal even?
But still if we can get smurf why not just do HC.
Also I just got a repeat WQ so so much for that not happening I guess.
Fix your game Blizz.
Getting tired of this I'm losing time to stun the players and announce I'd tired for this fight before running away thing.
All villians require a sense of dramatic flaire.
Or just imagine playing someones badly GMed campaign vOv.
Divine Intervention is such a buggy talent.
The problem with having GITS and Ar Tonelico music in my playlist is that anytime i listen to it there is a chance i remember Origa died.
What server is anyone on for horde btw?
I loved when i did entire dungeons healing as a shaman by just throwing buckets of water over the tanks head.
Noelor I have hordes on PvP shit realm Turalyon and Magtheridon.
Halls of Valour impression wtf so much trash trash harder than bosses o_0.
Ftrbzzs fyi my #1 reason I've not played PoE yet is an inability to pick a build p.
Halls of trash.
CookedAuto every western european language has a list like that though.
Not always the same list.
But a list like that.
Anathema I just took scion and went with whatever came to mind first.
Its not wrong.
Guess I've got this done at last. Can't wait for this to break into tiny pieces whenever I actually start playing v.
I just have to hope no one picks Shaman because I have no clue what statline I should've used for that one.
As I said last night elsewhere when someone linked that No modding still has not gone too far.
If we must turn to Tails to defend against the alien threat is it all that worth it in the end?
Sigh seems there is no legal way to watch Danganronpa anime in the UK.
Cruncyroll doesn't have it funimation says it isn't available in my territory.
Piracy it is!
It will be I'm just gonna watch Parks Rec tonight.
Sometimes ana even I can justify sailing the high seas for certain series by supporting the official release of others =P.
So this guy exists.
He sells ranks 2 and 3 of every material's belt recipe.
This is only a thing for belts.
Every other slot rank 2 is from someone in the profession's building in dalaran and rank 3 is... either a drop or rep I think.
But if you wanna make belts best go get those Sightless Eyes from Dalaran's PvP basement!
More forms is absolutely a good thing.
ChaosSmurf completing your class campaign gives an 825 relic for your third slot along with the chestpiece at 830 and a bunch of AP.
Oh and the last champion.
A whole chunk of stuff.
Also artifact power i guess ?
This is Not Okay.
MairBear E- 5 years of detention.
50 dkp minus.
This is some weird fanart.
Perfect D.
Why would you real this.
I don't know.
Also that adjective order list post is now starting to go viral and I'm getting it from multiple directions >-<.
I'm not sure adjective order isn't that obscure.
Not sure why*.
Real is a verb now?
Everything is if you want it to be.
Also of many of the things to be verbed real is fairly reasonable.
I'm all about the dropping adjectival copulae.
Note that that is not actually the same as verbing.
I have no clue what you just said.
In Chinese or AAVE you don't use words like is to link predicate adjectives.
And a bunch of other languages but those are the most common.
So He dead or You well.
This is not actually the same as verbing necessarily.
Doesn't this lead to ambiguity ?
Why would it?
Bear in mind I'm not actually talking about verbing I just wanted to throw long words at BwaS because I know he expects it of me.
I don't know but to my very western brain this seem unprecise. really feels like its missing information even though clearly in these examples no information is missing.
Literally just the use of is or has as a copula.
More complicated expressions definitely still get verbs so He dead is a different sentence to He will be dead or He was dead setting aside Chinese now because different tense system.
I can live with that.
Actually i'd rather just keep our quant inefficient adjectival copulae.
I'm attached to them.
I know 3 languages and all of them include the word is.
Not joking dutch english and frisian all use is in the same way.
He is dead. Hij is dood. Er is dea.
They're very closely related =P.
But I feel you.
Ooh different example but similar notion in English you would describe rainy weather as It is raining not It rains right?
I can't remember the name for this feature.
In French it's Il plume.
Yeah but fuck french.
Is it Er is reen? or w/e.
Its Het Regent.
Well no capital r.
And its a bit sparse for the general dutch comment on the weather.
Unrelated OneNote is just free nowadays afaict.
I pirated an older version i prefer which is not free.
Windows complains about this regularly.
And older version of onenote is being used to open note files.
RIP Mia Fey.
Free but also requires an Office account in addition to a Microsoft account.
And that account requires a subscription so...
Piracy it is.
I tried though!
But also tbh I should use the same version at home as at work or I'll end up annoyed at one of them.
Yes you did.
I've set up a book on my MS cloud mainly for uni stuff that I want to work on in the office.
Also maybe MairBear.
So first I dreamed I had called my friend over for a round of vidya but there were all these giant monsters roaming outside.
Then I dreamed I was a little girl swimming in the sea who became a millionaire selling these garlic shrimp creatures.
And then its back to the monsters.
Sounds like a dream all right.
Oh whoops forgot CS still uses this host. Probably should have warned him.
Well that's interesting GW is apparently ending their licensing deal with FFG.
CookedAuto they had one ?
Well yes how else were they able to publish their Warhammer games?
CookedAuto wait what no more DH2 supplements?
Not that I matters I think because I haven't heard about any new 40kRPG releases in ages.
Anathema Seems like it at least.
IIRC there is only 4 a pre-writ module Enemies Within Enemies Without and Enemies Beyond.
Hope my FLGS can get Without and Beyond then.
Granted this is just a rumor I read about but who knows.
Then again enemies Beyond was rleeased in January and there hasn't been much else news about any DH2 supplements.
The only 40k things that hast been released from FFG lately has been Conquest and even then the last two card packs from the latest cycle isn't out yet.

He practices it how to smile as fakely as possible.
Just so you knwo he's doing it on purpose.
BwaS thanks for the pack.
Sorry wild casual is not premier competition.
I honestly to god wish there was an enforced terrible gimmick decks mode.
And wild casual is the closest to that.
Well the deck gimmick there was 'hit auto-complete at 0/30' and let the game choose.
It has a fondness for baron geddon thrown in with a lot of 2-drops.
It did look a bit random.
When's this app out =/.
Few days i think.
=/ malch adds reno to your deck even if the deck isn't reno-viable.
Mulch does not care.
Malch not mulch.
Well there can't be a third brawl- streamer just before opponent plays Deathwing.
Its true its not a brawl.
It leaves a 12/12 on your side of the field.
He casts an invisible brawl he always wins.
MairBear I have been there.
I played my third Anyfin.
And indeed not a third brawl.
I had a mage whose yogg cast anyfin against me on murloc aggro paladin not a good time.
Oh man my shoulders hurt.
Lifted to hard ?
Spartan race on saturday.
Still sore from that.
Malfurian shares the name.
Bad-angry storm rage.
What a family.
All wow issues could be resolved if people just gave their kids nicer names.
Or just been better parents in general p.
MairBear Alkaid is yer monk right?
The name sounds familiar.
Its a mairbear name.
No t sure if its monk.
Tormented Spirits can no longer possess Vagan because sometimes he cannot die.
I saw last night very good. Better live than recorded.
Don't hear that very often.
First song on this album was especially great live.
MoonWolf well re if there's a fire live there was more guitar and people sang along to the chorus and she sounded more passionate.
Ftrbzzs where are you in PoE atm?
Vatican city can have it.
Anathema beginning of second.
Out tonight but will try to catch up tomorrow.
Am intending to do a totem witch.
They changed how CoC works quite a lot this patch so not sure how viable the build I used to have is.
I may test it out on my standard char and swap to it if it still seems plausible though >_>.
Getting a 5l volls is expensive though.
Anathema ah I see.
I'm just doing a random scion build.
<- this is just baiting to be used as reaction image.
Great.... the regular armour for leather-wearers is a full vest. Unless your a demon hunter. Then it's a harness.
Also oh my god. D.
I picked up the floating demonology skull on my warlock and it flies about in the character select menu.

4th wall breaking servoskull.
The huln fanfic was not any better the second time.
Huln fanfic ?
There's a quest in highmountain that tells the story of huln highmountain.
Who is the best tauren ever.
He killed the legion petted a magical deer impressed cenarion by doing so and then got crowned by malfurion to be the king of art and all klaxxi forever.
Some of that is not true.
In the quest he was not crowned the king of art and all klaxi.
Aren't the klaxxi a faction of mantid in pandaria.
If I don't go home for Christmas I think I can get away with speaking to my brother for less than hour for the whole of 2016.
You not get along?
No they don't.
Game is still on for tonight right?
Session may be 30 to 45 minutes late so it'll normal starting time!
I'm sure all you wow players will be very upset.
MoonWolf that character whose name I forget because it's long is Very Good at cutting.
Possibly The Best at Cutting.
I can never remember her first bit but I can always remember 'Murder the Gods and Topple Their Thrones'.
Its a good bit.
This wow app thing is nifty.
Also will become even more powerful if I pick that particular garrison upgrade.
Which allows me to just complete one world quest a day from my mission board.
Not that I will still seems rather limited.
MoonWolf I don't know your opinions on Extra Credits.
Rarely watch it.
Often think they overstate their case.
But they're doing a deep analysis of Durlag's Tower this week.
That might be fun to watch.
Ultra Beasts and the Aether Foundation Debut in Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon! I... see.
They really are shoving a ton of New Stuff in this generation.
Besides just new pokemon.
Oh yeah now I remember why I never log out.
Position in queue 2647.
Estimated time 47 minutes.
Don't worry being in a dead guild on a dead server isn't much fun either.
We got merged with the realm that was opened up during vanilla to empty ours out a bit that's how bad it is.
MoonWolf incidentally.
Noelor i already disagree with them on a bunch of stuff.
MoonWolf sorry delay turn if possible D.
Run out of delays.
Anyone fancy some hearthstone friendship gold?
After DD sure.
Aight give us a shout when you're done.
You have that one in golden oh my.
And a snap of said head gun.
Well that is ridiculously tactilol.
Stole a microsoft ergonomic keyboard from the desk of someone who left to see if it will help my wrist.
This thing is weird.
Maybe i just need better home row discipline.
Anathema it takes about a day to get used to and then it's wonderful.
Im going to try my mouse iyt in my lwft hand too.
Backspace is impoddible to reach without moving my hand wtf.
My world doesnt make sense anymore.
We can see that.
Can't deal changed back.
I will get it back if the physio recommends it next week.
So mad person from work I did the Spartan with qualified for the OCR World Championship because she's older and a girl and therefore has less competition top 20 per age group qualify.
Not actually mad also I can't afford to fly to canada on a months notice.
Anathema this stuff is more competitive then i though.
The top prize is $10k.
Relief offshore team aren't working tomorrow due to the strikes in India.
Blizz streaming needs facebook? What is this nonsense C.
Its facebook partnering nonsense.
Wow mages got shafted.
In class hall upgrades every class gets to pick between one of two techs Increased chance of warforging your quest rewards OR 20% bonus to the success of your first mission each day.
Except mage gets 10% and only if there are minions.
Every other class just gets a flat 20.
Wow mages got shafted <- seems to be a common theme this expansion.
The kirin tor quest lets you have rep with any faction of your choice.
Admiteddly the amount is halved with Nightfallen but still 750 is amazing.
MoonWolf was not disappointed at that image.
Its pretty good.
Ok so a Hati is normally a wolf.
B wow that's a huge pet.
Estimated time 38 minutes after that nice little DC.
Glenny your server.
Is the only one that has Locked as its population.
I should probably look into pirating some android games at some point now that I have a decent phone.
Feeling surprisingly spry considering how badly I slept last night and how early I was awake.
And how little food I've eaten today.
Anathema you'll get hit by the low soon don't worry!
Anathema just got some new coffee today from a new Finnish local roastery.
They have a 'swag' grading in the tasting notes..
I'll just think about how I have to talk to strangers tonight and the adrenaline from the anxiety will see me through p.
Ftrbzzs cool I haven't had proper coffee in a while.
Haven't been using the machine at home?
Not really don't eat breakfast on weekdays so don't keep coffee to hand at home so I have none for the weekends.
Hey even I started eating breakfast so you should too.
Need to maintain my svelte figure while I'm unable to exercise as much as before p.
Pfft coffee is good for your figure.
Coffee isn't breakfast.
It's called Finnish breakfast anathema.
Cup of coffee and depression.
One of the few things weightlifters will agree on coffee is good for cutting.
The only other things are don't curl in the squat rack and never skip leg day.
Those are dank fitness may-mays.
Well that place got dark real fast.
Found a half molten dryad.
Thye melt ?
MoonWolf fuck your country p.
Hey at least we are not googeling to figure out your whole what bits are called what situation.
Bloody Ireland too.
Anathema i mean what Do they look like.
Anathema I decided to try vegan Bertrand for a batch.
It is not as nice.
Definitely going back to the whey version.
Whats it based on tofu ?
MoonWolf seaweed and pea protein IIRC.
That doesn't sound like it'd be bad.
The active version has a faint seaweed aroma and a slightly chalky taste / mouthfeel. Regular Bertrand defintely tastes better but I need my protein.
Bahahah so one of the druids is watering a bush with a watering can and you talk to him for a quest... but because of how NPCs work he faces you.
So he just starts watering your face.
Got to keep the adventurers hydrated.
Maybe he thought I was a tree druid.
Except they took the good tree look and the ability to be a tree for any period of time away from tree druids.
Still bitter about that 4 expansions later.
Well they gave us a tome in this game that lets you shift into tree form.
It's the old treant and it has no special perks.
But you can do it!
I can play tree druid again.
Now i just need a reason to do it.
Tree feral druid.
As a friend of mine pointed out this scene perfectly frames a banner of lion lickers.
Lions are a type of cat.
Can you think of anothe word for cat ?
Fifteen different vowels and five tones. Distinguish long/short and rounded/unrounded. The only consonant is the glottal stop. fuuuuck off.
What language is that ?

MoonWolf do you remember a deep-voiced priest in Pillars?
The best part is you can find Tanda and Bax spooning in a tent in Highmountain and Marcus walking out of the door in front.
I need it mair.
Tandem and what now?
BwaS the link of CA's. The latest steamy romance novel.
Yeahhhh I just generally skip chan-links on principle.
...bikinis with boob windows.
Or maybe just boob window bras?
What you've not encountered the cat bra yet?
Yeah I was about to say Cat Lingerie has been a thing for a while now.
Noelor shits about to get significantly more Real it looks like.
Omg Pearl in a leather jacket.
Omg this episode.
I should catch up again.
In fact this would be the perfect moment to cath up on watching SU since I am leveling a paladin.
Selphie is the best FF8 character not in a Laguna dream. unsure if agree.
I mean she does say this.
I like her.
GlennCuttlefish I have the code things for ff.
How long are those valid I dont think I can log in to ff this week at least.
Or do I have to log in to the actual game.
Ah lovely something is being wonky with that I have internet yet my browser don't think i have with it.
GlennCuttlefish valid until 31st December to get it you just need to log into mogstation.
Yeah mog-account your account menu and then enter Item code.
Woo I remembered my pass and all.
Want the butler and the wings too? B.
Dont you need them?
I got two copies.
Well I dont mind.
Were these account wide or just for one character?
Account I believe.
Let me know when you're ready.
Err right now would be good.
Before I queue.
Have to do normal moodo on my paladin.

If it's not one of the longer ones I probably have time!
Items worked thanks <3.
Err the druid one.
Err... feel free to go on ahead as I probably won't be able to finish that one D.
Thats a thing.
Just opened my youtube subscriptions.
Chip uploaded GextraLife in 1-hour chunks.
Oh yeah GW is streaming.
Poor GW not even streaming cna save their games.
The channel still has 5.5k viewers.
Correction 5.5k total views.
I finally worked out what Mimiron was doing in my lodge.
If you chat with him he gives a quest to let you make Thorim's dog look like one of your own pets.
Looks like whatever you want it too.
That's a pretty good camera setup for the stream to show the game off.
Good to show of the state of the table.
Shame i have no clue what the infantry actually looks like.
Rewatching it now in the middle of an Ork vs Vampire game and the commentary is pretty solid too.
Only bad thing is that their setup for the commentators could be better as they run with one mic or something that also picks up the crowd around them.
That is just what I assume in this case.
How fitting that in order to find an incarnation of rexxar in legion you have to wade through a spawn point of boars.
I have no idea.
This is beyond me.
Noelor are you about for mythics tonight.
I don't think anyone ever actually goes to Wales. They're just led astray because they accidentally sneeze when they ask for directions.
Why does make paladin tanking so much better.
What doesn't it?
Well my mage experience is not improved by it at least.
Fortunately for that I have.
Are you sure its no.
You seem to like that song a log.
Bobby Roode - Glorious Domination Official Theme - YouTube.
Brain please dont lag behind that bad.
More caffeine ?
I think not. I mean I wouldn't mind a third jug but I think I'll go for a walk instead.
4 arms 4 hugs.
This is sort of a weird crossover but i'm totally okay with it.
Yep its weekend. queue already at 15min.
How ar eyou on the only realm with a queue.
I am guessing a lot of other guilds on dying servers decided to do as we did and move there.
Why are we Noelor-ing ?
We wanna do dungs.
But he is not around.
They're probably being all social and adult.
Maybe it's their board game day thing.
None of that is wrong.
Harry's a tool.
This is the best class benefit.
You get that as a class ability ?
Also pretty sure those wings are the wrong way around.
The wings are translucent.
And it's a benefit of my lodge.
See that tower over my left wing?
That's the southern watchtower of Trueshot Lodge ie where I jumped from with the Eagle Feather.
You can land a zone away.
This whole 'noelor maining a hunter' is unnerving me.
It does that.
I'm hilarious its true.
I picked blackberries yesterday with Emily and we made a TWO crumbles one apple blackberry and one blackberry apple I say we I mostly watched 3.
I had crumble for breakfast no regrets.
You know i'm pretty sure you made the same thing twice.
One was mostly apple the other was mostly blackberry.
Anathema you made delicious crumble and didn't send me any? -.

I need to start keeping my authenticator on my keyring.
'Cos this app does not deal with my connection stability at all well.
Thats an issue.
Such is the fate of any internet-requiring app outside of like.

Even if my phone could.

He's one of the original founding members.
Probably drowning in stock.
Are they individually listed?
I don't believe so.
And i wouldn't know how to find out if they were.
Literally typing Blizzard stocks into google.
Shows Actiblizz are listed.
And a dip is... predicted overnight? I don't understand stocks.
It's a shame Blizzard haven't had good writing for a while V.
I mean just last night I had to kill a mythic character because someone shot it with a corruption laser and turned it evil.
It would be nice if the game could have more genuine ideological or political conflict.
But any time they try that they undermine it halfway through with Dark Magic or other bullshit.
I looked like that was their plan with pandaland.
Do you want to know who I killed?
But then halfway through came out the magical evil hearts of doom.
Anathema sure i don't have a problem with wow spoilers.
Omg they showed an ffvii ps4!?
Did they announce a price?
Googling does not give relevant results just stuff about the game or the existing ps4 port.
ChaosSmurf might know.
Could ask him on twitter.
Doing the stormheim quests again.
And I am just wondering how this blight got here all by accident.
Huh both Nioh and Nier 2 in February.

Got it ty.
That meant to be anyone?

I feel like that was an episode.

Not sure if I pulled too early or they are meant to do that but my Death Knight bros did not show up until AFTER I'd beaten the fel reaver thing.

Game for tonight is cancelled due to moonwolf hasn't been sleeping well and has a massive headache and its too damn hot.
!note MairBear game for tonight is cancelled due to moonwolf hasn't been sleeping well and has a massive headache and its too damn hot.
These facts may all be interrelated.
Its hot i can't sleep this makes me tired and gives me a headache then my sleep next hot day is worse. repeat for like this whole week.
I need more rock playlists.
Guess I'll try working on WC13A or something instead.
Oh that's already next Wednesday.
In the topic.
I'm just shattered.
But MoonWolf already delayed gaem so I don't need to whine.
I'm just shattered <- same honestly.
Don't mind hot weather but weather this warm and humid shuts down my sleep and MoonWolf with 3 days of bad sleep isn't a happy wolf.
Noelor's week so far Monday job interview Tuesday busy day mostly training with no lunch break Wednesday long day mostly consisting of a presentation of accounting software with no lunch break and nothing to eat but flapjacks.
I like flapjacks but its not really lunch.
No it is not.
But I got half an hour break in the presentation.
Which was enough time to go upstairs ask some questions that came up from the morning session collate answers and email them to the relevant manager.
Not enough time to also go to Greggs.
But there were flapjacks from a birthday yesterday.
Also I'm good at dates.
Better than my.
Anyway tomorrow's payday so that won't be much better.
So I'm giving up on any pretense of having enough energy to Fellowship Friday night.
I wouldn't have been super attententive anyway.
Game cancelled? D.
Oooh sorry to hear.
MairBear its just days of compounded hot weather stealing my sleep.
All about the twins.
It is a bit of a theme yes.
Server died when we were just about to kill the last boss in the dungeon.
You face not dungeon boss alone but the server crashes I command.
Unlocked missions for my mage.
So I finally saw that dro client today.
Walked away from him with 23 withered remaining.
Theres a boss mob in the withered training quest scenario that people seem to have trouble with.
Withered training quest?
You'll get there.
I don't wanna.
Fucken all this non-dungeon content.
Its a solo dungeon.
That is not a dungeon.
Anathema it fast tracks you to arcway!
You will NOT want to be holydin though.
GlennCuttlefish how did you keep that many withered as a not-tank? O.
It's not actually that hard.
Once you can go in with 20.
I did manage to clear it and the only time I lost more than 1 withered was vs the Elf breaker didn't stun a stomp -6 withered and the spider hall.
Because they kept running away.
Mair dunno face tanked him for a couple of seconds then blinked away and just cast everything I had at him.
See my trouble is either i have a big army and just rules of nature him or I have to kite and then my withered can't hit for shit.
GlennCuttlefish Noelor.
Just made the mistake of reading the youtube comments on a video by a girl talking about something.
Ooh paladin buffs on the PTR.
Hmm one of the changes is turning a ret talent ability from an active into a passive.
Ie making ret dps even more RNG.
Also I dunno why they haven't done a hard hitting ret melee ability where you get a flash of wings. Imagine the human male jump-slash used for Mortal Strike or was used not sure if it still is but you get a glow and wings for a second.
Paladins they just want wings.
I'd rather Judgement was something like that and hit hard than the current shoot a gold hammer at people to debuff them.
>Jade releases a new XCOM2 videos >Its almost an hour long.
Must be they finally got to the vahlen mission.
It is yes.
Oh that's a lot of snakes.

I did Maw of Souls this morning.
Dps people kept getting killed by Helya's breath.
Its a pain in the ass to dodge.
I'm amazed how soon the recount-whores came out of hiding in legion.
Had 2 in a row today.
I might have been mageing all wrong until now.
Further experiments required.
I am good at videogames.
I was wondering why did these 2 mobs that came to interrupt me being afk were doing insane damage. Then I realized I had gone afk underwater and was drowning.
Clearly stealth nagas.
HS welcome bundle 10 classic packs + class legendary now up. £4 £2 being 2 packs at standard pricing.
For how long.
Anathema I have not yet survived a Helya fight.
Either I'm trying to read her and dying to the floor or I'm watching the floor and can't read her.
No idea probably a semi-permanent thing like the RAF bonus is but not like the standard whispers packs promotion was.
Did some wild casual n'zoth pally for daily q's. gold on tgt pack yields mysterious challenger.
Wondering if it's a sign.
Its a terrible sign.
Don't listen to this sign.
So you saw the sign and it opened up your eyes as you saw the sign?
That means what succeeds and fails depends on the consumer base.
Wrong line to paste.
Oh dear.
Group world quest in suramar.
This is too energetic.
Its only making me more upset.
And their bullshit.
Is a warrior soloing that quest in front of you?
Just ran in.
And did it.
And I am so upset right now.
Was it the kill 3 elites in bullshit district? Cos I had to use group finder for that x.
Yes it was.
I could do 2 of them solo.
Third one was impossible.
I really wanna level my warrior as Arms...
But Prot just seems too good to pass up.
Mair wanna run mythics tomorrow.
Huh no fellowship tomorrow.
Noelor's been having a tiring week.
I am right in the middle of that lovely display in the south xD.
And by nice i mean damn.
I am where that line hits the east coast.
Because the sound of the rain outside briefly woke me up a couple hours back.
In my experience when cataclysms suddenly STOP happening is when you run even FASTER.
Wow is actually factually literally unplayable today.
Disconnects every 15 minutes at best.
More ddos ?
Dunno if its DDOS or just silvermoon being shit.
Also mair in case you didn't see I will probably be going out during the evening probably back around midnight your time at the latest.
If you're still up for mythics then.
What time does Mairnai sleep these days ?
MoonWolf not too far from now.
So completly the wrong side of the day then alright.

Good lord I think I'm done writing all the crunch I need for 13A Warcraft pretty much done with the races classes and icon listings. Now I just need to figure out what kind of adventures. Which will be the real challenge by far.
MairBear found an interesting top-3 brawl deck barnes + innervate + deathwing dragonlord.
I tried the barnes yshaarj combo but there were more barnes being pulled than yshaarj S.
Yeah you got a 50/50 on getting what you want.
But getting that 1/1 deathwing having it die and putting 3 12/12's on the field is worth it.
Hmm. Well played. I concede to you.
I've had people concede the moment the barnes hit the field before it even got to show what it was.
And people just dragging the game out refusing to play anything to kill my 1/1 against.
You done the welcome bundle yet moon?
Nah don't really need it.
Mostly i'd be doing for a legendary i'm not paying 5 bucks for a potentially duplicate class legendary.
MairBear can you win a game of HS for me ?
MoonWolf about to plunge into a mythic dungeon so if I don't pull off a fast win probably not until later D.
MairBear the fuck is your brawl deck supposed to do ?
Its not a very god deck though.
Its just that this pries deck is pretty weak against saps.
Damn it Lowtax fix your shit.
The clouds are gone.
Thats why we don't have lp posts.
Guess that explains things.
Well the forums are technically working just so slow they as well not be.
Oh apparantly i stumbled upon the 4th best top-3 deck by myself.
Omg netdecking cancer!
4th best top 3.
Next thing we know he'll be 3rd best top 4.
Noelor the current brawl is called top-3.
Its like top-2 but 3.
Anyway barnes deathwing dragonlord and innervate.
Can we play the guess who is ddosing game instead.
Those script kiddies who got banned from overwatch?
Why would they ddos something aweful ?
So unfair I get to recruit a night elf paladin but I can't play one!?
I'm sure they'll unlock that option in an expansion or two.
Or whenever An Azeroth Reborn is released.
You think you've got problems one of my team is a gnome hunter. survival at that.
You think you have it bad? my librarian is dead and doesn't know it there are creepy portraits in my class hall and I have millhouse manastorm in my base.
Thats pretty bad.
Okay I'll give you that one.
BwaS Addie is adorable I.
She is the only gnome hunter that is allowed though.
Anyone for heroic neltharion's lair?
SA seems to have recovered.
So it has.
Anyone for a random heroic?
Lol wut.
Simple awnser its compromised.
Well at least he's not a gnome hunter.
No then I expect the biggest gun possible.
They are getting better at this.
That genestealer looks to bulky.
I though they were supposed to be sleeker.
Because that's a prime or somesuch.
Alternatively a Patriarch.
Blood bubbled up from the ground in little springs. The trees were growing skulls where the fruit should be. I concluded that I was somewhere from Aztec mythology. Probably not one of the good parts.
It was neither a jungle nor a desert. More of a grassy valley with bushes and occasional trees. The sun had a face locked in a perpetual grimace. I had a vague memory that Aztec mythology was really bad.
Eternal beef drives man to madness.
I cant even remember what I put in todays food experiment anymore.

<- a really good xcom2 mod.
Meanwhile in dalaran.
That moment when your wild ladder game against a standard legal cthun control priest suddenly pulls a yogg out of his arse.
WELL I used the millhouse disguise vs Millificent manastorm in violet hold...
She hits you for millions.
How many millions ?
MairBear omg the second horseman.
MoonWolf as a tank with 1.7 mil on normal she hit for 2 million.
I imagine it's worse higher up.
MairBear wanna do transmogging at some point then?
Thats a group activity now ?
Well getting transmog gear can be.
MairBear I got hit for a lot but not more damage than I had HP o_0.
GlennCuttlefish sure! Give me .... hrm... 20 mins? Pure guess.
No hurries I have to finish some world quests that expire in <3 hours.
<3 u too.
Did you just...even more did I just.
I mean I responded after I read it through but I did think you first typed no hurries <3...
MairBear you need caffeine.
GlennCuttlefish Where going? What bringing?
To the transmog ethereals clothing.
I think I needed ICC for something.
My facebook is informing me that I could now buy a house in orc meadows.
Decent schools in the area? how are the transport links?
What's the risk of raids?
Any quaint elven villages around ?
Considering its orc meadows I doubt it they've already been depeleted.
It could be a historical name.
It could be locked in a stalemate by stubborn world designers afraid to progress storyline.
The death knight story is so great.
They're just like we're already dead let's piss off everybody possible.
This is one of my recruiters for disposable nameless troops to send on missions.
He'll go far.
Hunter one feels a bit weird for me. they try to describe us as silent protectors in the wilds.
I'm more like bitch I rolled this class to be the dwarf rifleman from wc3 I find the biggest gun and shoot em with it!
Thats the problem with classes with very broad spectrums of fantasies.
Like hunter and warrior.
Priest and druid too really.
The protection paladin one is literally fly to a place do two fights -> get artefact really quick.
A level 103 blood DK starting <40% hp can solo a 110.
Fuck blood dks.
Always been the most broken thing for bullshit survival.
And soloing bosses.
Well that's just the whole world scaling tech.
Because if it were scaling it wouldn't have been 110.
Please click for the self-reply.
Wait where do they get kinda-lingers out of that?
I'm not sure they really thought class hall progression through they certainly don't follow a coherent formula between classes x.
EG priest has to do two dungeons and a grind quest before they unlock their 8-hour mission. Mage has a mission with a duration-increasing ability that you cannot counter that early...
And Shaman has a quest that I actually had to pause and do other things cos it was so dull. Which amounts to kill 100 elementals in a shaman only space where if you pull more than 3 you won't survive.
The only way around that is there are storm dragons that give 5 of the item you need but they need a ranged pull at the right moment and are not very common.
Thats... pretty bad.
I should have had more breakfast.

Didn't plan on it.
My health seems okay.
Nobody has cancelled on me yet.

Not many ranged weapons have that.
MairBear Noelor GlennCuddlefish ?
First round of todays combat.
GlennCuddlefish not wrong.
Well that's a glaring flaw in the priest class hall.
Training dummys for DPS are on one side Training dummys for healing on the other.
IE Disc priest is not allowed to train.
Blizzard hates disc this expansion MairBear.
They were too good last expansion.
I've done a pair of dungeons as a disc priest it's so far the most stressful too but that's mostly because of the learning curve.
They took away all the fancy shields.
Also my addon didn't recognise Atonement as a noteworthy buff as the mechanics changed for it so didn't display when someone had it up.
What does it do now ?
When you heal anyone or shield them it applies an 8 second or so buff to them otherwise the same 50% of damage turned into healing.
Does atonement healing proc the the atonement buff ?
But that buff is not refreshed by damage-based healing.
Also penance is only a damage spell now.
They ruined disc.
What good is penance if i can't shoot healing orbs at someone in an emergency.
Can be channelled while moving but if you want to heal another player you have talents plea a pathetic instant heal that costs 100% mana for each atonement you have active shadow mend which puts a dot on them until they take X damage.
Either from the dot or from boss attacks etc.
... man they really do hate disc now.
And radiance which is a light heal that hits and spreads atonement to 3 allies.
100% mana increase for having healed people before.
The fuck blizzard.
Yeah shadow mend is a very strong heal but if your tank is not taking constant damage it is effectively half as good.
And your artifact deals big damage + 10% more for everyone with atonement so you've got one incentive to spread it around and another to make sure only the tank has it.
That being said if played to perfection it keeps up with other healers and does more damage than they can so in the end it works out but ... harsh curve and requires you to know when the tank will take damage.
Well damage ancitipation has always been a disc thing.
Still i dislike the serious hit in flexibility.
MairBear that's easy if Warrior | DK -> never else -> all the time.
If DH just ignore it they'll fully heal on a whim.
It might not be terrible.
I'm not optimistic though.
At least they didn't town down the majors rampant bisexuality ?
I should really say pansexuality on account of the AI thing in the first movie.
I should probably watch SAC.
I'll watch it and then bash it.
Still not pleased about the whitewashing of kusanagi.
Ftrbzzs do RH people internally feel ire towards CentOS? you can tell me I wont gossip.
Anathema not really part of our RnD budget goes towards supporting the CentOS community.
Of course if the conversation is whether you should use CentOS or RHEL the conversation might be different.
None of the shots in that teaser were actually bad.
So I am cautiously optimistic for now.
Not actually bad bar one.
Yeah I thought the same but maybe they were the only visually good shots..
Yeah that might be the case.
Ftrbzzs stop doing things right.
I might need to learn your difficult language.
Anathema well a lot of things are planned like my metro outside my flat that was supposed to run in August and might now maybe run in January.
So it's nice to have a vision.
Anathema but we can do a language exchange -.
You already speak English at a pretty high level that isn't much of an exchange p.
Learning never stops.
Working with you and Geoff was actually a big thing for my language use.
Now I'm actually taking a step back since I'm not working with native speakers.

This is fighting Augus on the moon to... that classical song yes.
Idr its name.
Thats the problem with classical music.
Half of it doesn't have good names.
As vicas pointed out last episode though.
They use a bunch of classical stuff during Augus scenes.
I love it.
I always wanted to play Dragonball Z also pertinent.
This game lets yo udo that.
I wish they made more asuras wrath.
Instead of endless naruto games.
I think theres enough of asuras wrath.
More games as good as asuras wrath without literally being asuras wrath then ?
I wouldn't go quite as far as saying asuras wrath was a good game.
It was an amazing experience with sadly lacking gameplay.
While Hera blames Zeus for rising divorce rates it’s mostly out of habit.
Get your shit straights gods.
So feasts are bugged the recipe gives 5 feasts for 5 of each 300-stat meal. The level 2 recipe only costs 4 of each meal but only produces one when it should produce 7.
THe level three costs even less and still produces only one |.
You sure its bugged and blizzard doesn't just want to make you spend tons of stuff for feasts ?
Oh I mean they're the same feast just the rank 2 of the recipe.
Thats dumb then.
Yeah they have admitted its a bug when GMs have been asked.
So... hotfix it blizzard.
I guess highly used raid cooldowns are a lesser priority.
MoonWolf I just recruited a lightspawn D.
Can you cast power word fortitude on it to make it hit harder ?
<- look its chaossmurfs dream come true.
I don't get the point of any of the professions this expansion.
Well have to wait for them to put the craft back in warcraft.
Well good thing I'm too poor to afford VR.
Twitter did something dumb to their api again.
Bunch of tweets cutting off halfway through on Plume to finish off with links to themselves.
Plume will probably update.
Fenix is the same.
Minister iirc they made urls and names not count for the character limit.
Yeah I knew they were doing that.
How it's implemented just seems to have fucked itself.
I haven't looked at the API recently to comment.
If I play Fellowship again I hope there's anathema n orc.
They're real cool.
I hope I play games with you guys sometime too p.
ChaosSmurf you about?
MairBear so this FF 14 4.3 patch is MASSIVE.
And also Alphinaud's infinitly more useful and competent sister is sick ? tired ? just lounging on a couch ?
Oh my god.
They added WoD/Legion style missions.
For your grand company.
Noelor smurf was asking if you wanted to raid for an hour before RP thing.
That's why I'm on mumble.
So you are!
I was running around mostly afk.
Mairbear noelor.
GlennCuddlefish MoonWolf.
I will be eternally baffled foreigners dont have this.
Huh never heard about that.
GlennCuddlefish I want one but.
I'd have to build an entire cupboard myself?
And am too lazy.
Oh dear I browsed a wow forum.
People complaining about Artifact power and how alts will never catch up and so on.
But ... there's a finite amount of traits...?
Unless the artifacts can power up forever even when done with traits?
You have the main trait tree then another... 20 slot? hole unlocks in the corner.
Just a points dump for % stat gains.
Truly the end of times to have to respec etc.
And there is catch up rate of artifact knowledge research speeds up later into expansion.
Okay yeah final hole is 20 rank.
On MM hunt first rank gets +5% dmg finishes at +15% dmg at 20 pts.
Takes you from like 5.2 mill AP to 65 mill to full completion total investment.
And if there is a chance you'll finish they'll patch another 5 exponentially scaled levels in.
And the 4th relic slot.
Totally working as intended.
Have I mentioned how bullshit warriors are atm?
I mean sure they did nerf tank healing.
Wow is really good at making it appear like maps are a lot bigger than they actually are.
The main quests usually take you on some sight seeing tour that masquerades the fact that you're actually going just next door.
Today in weird news guy tries to kiss a woman on a train gets rebuffed steals here iphone instead. police find him with said iphone up his ass.
Well thats fucking brillaint.
Ran out of subscription in the middle of the training scenario.
Which means I have to wait 3 days to do it again.
Also what the hell why was my credit card charger only 5 days after the subscription started.
GlennCuddlefish do you care about spoilers for the DK plot?
Death Knight pissing of Azeroth World tour 2016.
Err. not really i guess.
I'm on my way to get the 3rd horseman.
Specifically I'm on my way to the Scarlet Monastery.
To dig up the High Inquisitor.
Poor guy just cant get a break.
Thats sort of cool.
At least she gets to kick ass for the Death Lord again.
Btw this thing has sort of passed me by and probably the rest of you.
But after seeing this.
I think eveyrone should watch that and seriously consider watching thudnerbolt fantasy.
Because its amazing.
And wuxia as fuck.
I'm going to pass that onto a friend whose into the doll scene.
Japanese wuxia thunderbirds.
Its on croll if you have a subscription.
Noelor with amazing special effects.
It includes bouts of chinese poetry.
Well it wouldn't be chinese poetry if it was in japanese would it.
They will never nerf prot warriors -chaossmurf 2016.
Did they finally nerf warriors ?
Noelor wait what you get Whitemane?
Omg you do brb rerolling DK.
Heh I think I knew about that before Legion came out. Such a shame they slap her in plate p.
Does she keep the hat ?
Noelor GlennCuddlefish.
MairBear bet your sorry about that now!
Control warrior mirror in the EU championship right now |.
Goddamnit mairnai D.
So apparently this delightful person was in our city centre today.
Control warrior mirror in the EU championship right now | <- fucking 90+ hp count.
Not gonna miss justicar in standard except for when used in the other 7 classes for novelty value.
Yknow I don't think I've ever managed to get a full golden monkey game off...
I have a few times.
That's normal mode of the first raid done.
Last boss was fun. also happy that I can finally keep up around 200k DPS in longer fights.
I'll see it in LFR someday. Dead server dead guild feels bad man.
Seems most of my pvp these days comes from wankshafts hosting their dungeon runs on pvp servers and getting ganked at the instance portal.
A legend indeed.
Is that not a legendary outfit?
Oh hey Jade's back.
With a very special episode.
From human-vector jAIDS!
Todays oglaf is very oglaf.
Includes the paladins for group sex.
How do you do fellow Nightborne?
CRAVE THE CAVE.
MairBear so the main thing holding back playing a bunch of alts actually turns out to be Order Resources I guess?
You need to work harder for them than garrison resources ?
Yeah amazing how many you actually generate by doing stuff.
SunTiger you have to actually play the game basically.
Grants the Flaming Keg ability which does exactly what you think it will do. Thanks Brewmaster artifact.
Fuck blizzard making me play their game.
There are no missions to get them they certainly don't just appear from nowhere.
They're rewarded from treasure hunting rare hunting dungeon bosses? and world quests.
Sometimes one-off quests.
MairBear unrelately they fixed Acherus.
You can now ride about in it.
SunTiger I watched too much Cubivore this morning and now that shitty trumpet is stuck in my head.
Its such a good shitty trumpet though.
Its funny because a junk is a type of boat.
Flintlocke goes missing in stormheim engineert quest sends me to find him before something happens to Stormheim.
I wish my quests had anything cool like that.
Also had to reclaim stolen fireworks from Dophnu Phraid Valmir and Smacky with a dog called Shoob.
Also testing a bandage gun prototype on the guards around dalaran.
Yes really SunTiger.
Are you forgetting that we're dealing with Blizzard here that can only do pop culture references and corruption plotlines? p.
Oh looks like Bobbin Threadbare is doing DXHR as his next LP.
Oh yeah there's some minor backstory to that and it's not what you think it is.
Also wtf hunter quests.
Rexxar blah blah has a camp to the south of here.
Due north by a mile.
Noelor are you likely to be about and want to raid in the next 30 mins?
Did the quest text say that did it? huh.
MairBear I don't remember having any trouble finding Rexxar but tbh >reading quest text.
Also I'm just about to go out to get a curry so depends how prompt that is/how quick I can eat.
Can i interest someone in 80 HS monies ?
Got so hyped by the idea of burgle rogue and after a couple of games of it today I think I hate it.
Oh look a rogue mirror and the deck is now rendered invalid.
Burgle rogue is like a thoughtsteal priest but even less predictable cards.
Because at least in the priests case there is a good card filter because the deck is made by a person.
Rogues can just get straight up terrible cards.
Oh gods this prick on wild casual running /golden/ malch.
Oh and a golden living roots t1.
And a golden acolyte and black knight yeah I'm not sticking around with this p2w prat.
Ahhh another daily quest grind another succession of priests who can't deck build and expect you to do it for them and fatigue you out. brilliant.
SunTiger Gilgamesh time!
Anime mods when.
Anime mods day 1.
Assuming they are giving away the mod tools da y1.
D'awwww cute the freeze mage on wild casual fused me cos I had lethal after popping his block with no 2nd in hand.
2 can play at that game.
MoonWolf I corrected someone who called your country Holland at the weekend I hope you appreicate that p.
Every so much.
I really wanna run or play in a sci-fi RPG.
Anathema smells like cyberpunk 2020.
No updates on nishkriya for a week.
Are people posting?
I bet the page structure changed again.
I have not actually looked at it figured you'd be able to just say if queries were erroring.
Oh I'd have to login.
That moment when two streamers are playing eachother on ladder while respectively live and neither are sniping D.
Ah the Forsaken.
I'd missed you.
Hurry up and unlock LFR >.<.
Already did it.
For some reason it was open for like 20 minutes earlier today.
Some glitch from it launching on NA I suppose.
Grabbed a grp together for a mythic+ as keystone about to expire ended up running 3 pluses total with same grp.
BRH+5 mauled us though and we couldnt get close to matching timer.
Having reached $155000 we can work with a group of designers to create Live Action Roleplaying LARP Rules for Scion. oh my.
More like the server needs it.
So we are doing this boss in LFR.
I say we are doing this boss. theres a pack of 2 tentacles and a devilsaur before it.
While we are killing it a healer manages to pull the boss.
The boss is some 150 yards away from the pack.
The moron just ran in.
GlennCuddlefish instance wasn't going fast enough.
Food is so awkward why can't I just be sustained by sunlight and air and hatred?
About 19 out of 25 people have not read up on mechanics.
Because about 19 people died to a thing as simple as go through the door before timer expires.
What is different on that boss in LFR compared to normal?
Just smaller numbers?
Just smaller numbers.
Wait what DK the quest has them fucken invade the Paladin Order Hall and as Highlord no-one bothers to mention it?
THEY TRIED TO RAISE TIRION FORDRING.
AND WE STILL PARTY WITH THESE DICKS!?
He's dead why are you complaining about getting fordring back.
Turning him into a deathknight is pretty disrespectful.
Its a war.
We don't have time for respectful.
If he was supposed to be alive the Light would have saved him at the Broken Shore.
The light is just naaru radiation.
It doesn't have a say in anything.
>people who use 'return' as punctuation in chat programs that beep and flash at you.
Anathema so you hate me.
I hit that damn return all the time everywhere.
You don't do this.
Anathema or do you!
Anathema ... I do.
Well now you know that it kills me a little inside every time.
Man I knew DH's were fotm cunts but theyre pretty ridic in pvp.
This is worse than wrath.
Don't worry they're obviously going to get nerfed next patch now that they can go over doing balance patches.
Which is really helpful when the pvp bonus event is right now and is their only hope in hell all expansion to get ppl to give honour... 3.0?... a chance.
I feel like people who wanted to PvP have had a bit more of a chance than the last two days to do so.
Not like Legion just launched.
Once more i've managed to drive a car and not hit anything.
SunTiger game on for tonight still?
I remember that feeling.
Right will not commit to full length raid then.
BwaS last week was my first hour in a car and that was... not nearly as smooth.
Nerfs to everyone's favourite balanced children's card game.
Yeah my first ever driving lesson was pretty horrendous.
Yogg stopping his cast if its destroyed is fair enough.
They basically killed Charge as a spell though.
Execute to 2 mana feels pointless.
Its usually used for big threats anyway.
Tuskarr is a dead card now.
That worgen deck kinda has a bit of non-interactivity similar to warsong plus patron I guess.
I like the abusive change.
BwaS sure but they just changed charge from used in only the one deck to never going to be used again.
I look forward to every fucking charge thing ever in HS to get nerfed next time.
Gnomeregan infantry rip in piece 2014-2014.
Stonetusk boar 1-0/1 charge.
Gimme 30 more prep minutes.
We starting on time?
Bit late need to tweak numbers on final boss finish drawing tihs map.
GlennCuttlefish Noelor MairBear.
Definitely how it works.
Last fight pulling all stops.
Dang got an 865 off the mythic+ class hall chest O.
Anathema ChaosSmurf MairBear are one of you southerners hosting new years?
Ummm? Hmm! Probably could if that was teneble and appreciated?
ChaosSmurf Discord makes me mad btw.
Are you dissing it?
Discord is a bloated piece of shit.
And it doesn't even look nice for it.
To be fair when compared to Skype Discord is amazing =p.
That is literally its only benefit.
Eh I like the ability to have different rooms.
The devs do keep adding features which is nice though.
I disagree but ok.
Noelor I could my house is small and cold though. But it's a good excuse to not spend it with my family >_>.
Thats anathema begging you to bring your own supply of blankets.
More like a winter sleeping bag p.
I dunno maybe if the fire is on and there is more than one person in it it can stay warm? uncharted waters.
OTOH I have fast internets a big telly and am within walking distance of Cambridge it's a long walk though.
Anathema 'within walking distance' is a bit relative in your situation -P.
I've walked it multiple times after a night out P.
Yes.. but it's by no means a short walk.
How short/long are we talking here.
20 minutes ? 40 ?
Anathema an hour?
Well if you start it quite drunk and get a kebab you can be fairly sober by the time you get home p.
This is some quality cosplaying.
They even did the FEET.
SunTiger do you know if Skywind ever got anywhere approaching enjoyable ?
It didn't or you don't know?
I don't know but i don't think it ever did get very good.
Oblivion just isn't a very good engine to play games in.
Didn't they do one in the Skyrim engine?
Man someone needs to redo New Vegas in the FO4 engine >_>.
Skywind is still heavily in development.
You can't really play it.
And you need to be part of the team to even get builds.
SunTiger does Dutch not do a voiceless f?
F is voiceless v is voiced.
Otherwise the same consonant.
Dutch and english have a practically identical F.
Difference in 'off' and 'of' ?
So yes we have a voiceless f.
Yes anathema of is ov and off is of because fuck English spelling~.
Why do you ask ?
Reading for uni.
Not sure why its implying we don't.
Pretty sure we do.
There are some comparison words of the Germanic languages English Dutch and German being the primary ones.
And the one that led to that question was foot/fuß/voet.
No we just have a different word there.
But if you take say Fiets bike and compare it to Foot.
ChaosSmurf ya git.
I need to see if work will give me a proper backpack for my laptop instead of a satchel.
Because my shoulder is very not happy.
Anathema> well if you start it quite drunk and get a kebab you can be fairly sober by the time you get home p <- this is the correct distance to live from town.
Oh hey a metal album inspired by NGE.
ChaosSmurf did you write Kooper unironically?
!note GlennCuttlefish.
Friday friday AND payday payday.
Careful or it might turn into a mayday mayday.
Practicing hand-writing IPA notation.
Fucking schwa keeps messing with my head.
Not very schway.
Minister its understandable though.
MoonWolf I mean.
No most people cannot read ipa.
Stupid human body with its hormones betx.
What are they doing wrong now ?
What are they doing right!?
Letting you have a body in general.
They tend to be pretty good at that.
On the whole.
I mean I'm assigning hormones blame for a crush.
Which idk if fair?
Sure go with that.
Human body is the worst.
I cant wait for the day I can turn off parts of it at will.
Also my paladin is now suramar dungeon eligible woo.
New goal.
Time to work on that core strength.
Anathema same but just her hair.
Just need to attend to mission boards.
One of the accountants I was working with this afternoon had to leave in a hurry dead on half four.
Because his kid had swimming lessons.
Just went onto facebook and No swimming lessons tonight. Someone 💩 in the pool.
The animation in next civilization is pretty great.
Thats a pretty menacing idle animation.
I'm the guy in the back.
Why does that one meido have two heads?
None of them do ?
Sure the ginger pigtails one and the black hair one join up at the apron.
Here is a cute comic aobut pre-teen korra.
Anathema sometimes that second part doesn't happen!
MoonWolf I made Trigger as supporty as possible.
And gave him an icon die with The Priestess to support it.
I'm pretty happy with the story suggested by his icon spread.
It's a good thing we're playing on roll20 so I can roll a d17 for cleric spells.
I pick a cleric spell at random.
There are 17 cleric spells up to level 7.
Ignoring the class feature heal and resurrection.
Oh also you should check One-Eye's Jest under Lich King original name Unsummoning.
Does all the wow related VOIP just happen on discord/that other mumble now ?
Discord is just being used for its irc side basically?
Smurf said he plans to move voip there eventually though.
Noelor where are you hiding the full character sheet for this character ?
0038 MoonWolf.
Right going to have to keep some leevl relevant undead around.
Incase you end up swapping enemies with undead.
That is really creepy.
That whole feed.
A weapon to surpass Metal Gear.
MairBear its a perfect weapon.
There is no counter.
Big brother stops crimes -.
You know its going to be one of those days when your alarm clock goes off 3hours after you got up.
Another little bit of chocobo trivia they weren't actually originally rideable in 1.0. It took a later patch in that game to add them and this was another contributing factor the game feeling unfinished. There were chocobokeeps but no ability to ride them. Also the Japanese version used the kanji for horse馬 and bird鳥 instead of the katakana for chocobo which stirred up a.
Bit of a fuss in Japan.
MoonWolf did you point me at Darker Than Black?
Not sure why anymore but we had a dicussion in which chinese electric batman came up.
I'm 3 eps in.
It's p cool.
Albeit I have no idea what's going on.
It does that.
The goose toy honk would also have worked well there imo.
Hunter artifact hidden appearances one drops from a raid boss the other two are in shops.
DK artifact hidden appearances one drops from the Withered scenario the other two ???
MairBear help my tanks keep exploding.
GlennCuttlefish help same.
You on ursoc as well?
The tanks are yelling at each other.
It's very scary =<.
Noelor Normal dungeons or naw/.
Going to a couple of WQs then bed.
MairBear I got delayed by deciding it was time to actually fashioncraft now I'm hc ilvl.
Also dunno when I'll be about but could you come heal me through a hc at some point so I can work out if I'm actually competent?
I am seriously contemplating downloading WoW so I can grab the Quest completed and Quest added sound effects.
Well I found the program to do it so I guess I'm dowloading the game files v.
!note MairBear Nether Ray Direhorn Go get do it.
Season 1 of Rick Morty is on Netflix now.
The WoW episode of South Park aired 10 years ago today.
Nicola Sturgeon's twitter feed is brilliant I can just imagine her yelling ah fucken telt ya at people.
Except not quite that scottish ?
Maybe in private she has a much stronger lower-class accent p.
Probably not though but it's fun to imagine.
Wow it /is/ possible to make Stormcast Eternals look cool.
Anathema there is a ton of extra custom modelling on this stuff.
Its totally possible to make stormcast eternals look good if you are willing to give everyone super detailed heads and custom elements.
Also known as if you manually redesign the whole thing.
The heads thing is just use space wolf heads.
Just buy a space wolf army worth of head bitz.
Or use Empire Knights heads.
Pretty sure that's only a bunch of Chaos Marauder heads.
It's space wolf heads I read the comments. The guy also has 15k pts of wolves p.
Thats a lot of wolves.
Huh could've sworn some of those heads came from Marauders as well /.
I need to get a kill team campaign going with my friends I think.
Then I'd suggest just using the Heralds of Ruin ones.
Oh some random blog has fan rules.
Whenever the topic of Kill Team comes up those are the ones that are usually recommened over the GW ones.
It even has Battlescribe support.
Damn that's a lot of army lists too even Adeptus Arbites and Feral Orks.
Omg and Legiones Astartes.
Funny enough Vol 6 of the FW HH books has Kill Team rules.
Did they make it into the new Red Book too?
Horus's Little Red One is only for Legion rules afaik and no campaign systems.
Ok guess I need to get V6 then.
Otherwise listen to the IC's review of the rules since they go over it rather well including the Kill Team-ish rules and their effect on the campaign system.
That is a long podcast.
They've got timestamps pretty sure the rules are discussed in part 4.
I need to buy the rest of the HH books only have 1 atm.
But that is like a £300 purchase >_>.
Also like I don't have enough shit to read atm.
Also I can't afford ti <_<.
Of course it cames back just afte I aske.
Thats how it works.
I have eaten too much food this was a mistake.
Shit I forgot it's my sister's birthday tomorrow.
Wait I totally left a thing ahead of time in June when I was at my parents.
Planning ahead I see.
Pokémon sun + moon yes megavolution is back.
Also Dartrix may be my patronus?
Were megavolutions ever in doubt ?
Not even a little.
What i want to know if they fixed all the dumb looking ones.
They finally confirmed though.
Brionne evolved Popplio is adorable.
Torracat evolved Litten is... just a bigger Litten afaict?
Doesn't gain a type ?
Does not gain a type.
Only Dartrix does.
This means nothing for final forms of course.
Other than Dartrix is *probably* evolving to still be Grass/Flying.
I get a hitbox notification that a streamer I follow whose streams follow the format vs is streaming.
Title Fae vs Farming.
I tune in expecting Stardew or Harvest Moon.
Actually Farming Sim '13.
It seems to be multiplayer?
Your plow lines are a bit crooked You know me I can't do anything straight gay comedy at its peak.
Humanity is doomed.
Been that for a while now.
Stream's over my DK is ilvl 820.
Sad things about office life I moved desk again today on account of my new job.
And was unreasonably happy to have been assigned a seat on the end meaning I actually have a wall well the back of a cabinet to stick things to instead of having to use the side of my desktop.
That poor pikmin.
If I was single I would actively be looking to move right now.
How seriuos are you and girl who'se name you've not mentioned before ?
Well it's only been just over 4 months so far but things seem to be going pretty well? Usually see each other 2+ times a week. I dunno I've not been in a relationship this long since Sarah and that was different cause we'd known each other for years beforehand >_>.
Also her name is Emily.
Sounds good to me.
It's a shame graphics are good these days so we wont get any more live action cutscenes like in CC and Red Alert.
You never know retro is still a ting.
Right now they are doing 8bit.
Maybe eventually they'll do cheap cgi look.
I dream of such a game.
Far Cry Blood Dragon should have done that.
Can't pee for an hour an a half but made myself a cup of tea anyway #livingdangerously.
Seriously the fuck does he need that house for.
Social approval duh.
Unless he has two dozen friends / family living there its pointless to own.
Probably an attempt to not feel dead and empty inside.
Giant empty houses are not good solutions to that.
Should have gone with expensive normal sized house for that.
Well it's not like feelings are rational.
Sort of the point of them yes.
That is their biggest flaw.
I mean if I was filthy rich the first thing I would buy is a decent sound system.
Then a house big enough to store it.
Notch bought a house that has features like 15 bathrooms and dining room that seats 24.
Its stupidly big and stupidly expensive.
And at best he lives there with like a girlfriend.
When i said two dozen friends and family i wasn't joking.
Thats what the house can fit people wise.
Ok so I'd need 2 decent sound systems to fill that place.
It already comes with a dedicated cynema room.
Its probably decent sound system wise.
But what if I want to listen to my CD of owl calls outside the cinema room?
Good headphones ?
If I could afford speakers nah.
MoonWolf lateness still probable btw half past maybe?
Sorry to do this so last minute but i won't be able to do OTS tonight Minister just PM me your thoughts on trigger.
See you tomorrow.
MoonWolf did you get my long PM from Minister?
The bleach got done right after I hit enter.
Sorry mom got called away work and stuff needs to happen around the house in regard to little brothers.
S'fine I haven't eaten.
This week's mythic chest level 5 bolstered Maw and +30 ilvl and a slot for gloves \o/.
I just got shitty gloves.
Also my DK is now qualified to tank LFR.
Everything is terrible.
Anathema ain't it just so.
Huh finance office are being really loud right now and it made me remember a dream I had where I snapped and shouted at people in this office to be quiet since some of us have work to do.
Anathema just go and close their door without saying a word.
And should be pretty quiet without AQ team being noisy -.
Ftrbzzs some guy from Geneva is here.
Omg latest VS preview is adding the one feature I miss from resharper.
Haha Slack is an Electron app? fuck that.
Meanwhile my irssi is using 18MB.
... thats a lot.
For a text ui irc client.
Not really? that's combined code + data and I have a bunch of plugins perl scripts.
Sisters of Battle have not received any new miniatures... since vanilla WoW was still in Alpha testing.
Are its rules even relevant to the current 40k rules anymore ?
They have a current-ish codex pdf only.
Yess new albumn from nervous_testpilot.
Nervous_testpilot did the Frozen Synapse OST the OST for Frozen Cortex is now on Spotify now = a while but I didn't realise.
...I can live with the half naked men in this series.
But why does EVERY SINGLE SHOT have sparkles in it.
Bacause its fabulous ?
I'd rank only 50% of the cast fabulous.
MoonWolf I got your dumb Overwatch joke.
And appreciated it.
At least someone did.
ChaosSmurf this is what it looked like when I d/c'd.
Guessing it went downhill from there?
Everything is still terrible.
I cooked a good dinner last night though.
God that goatee looks dumb on him.
Why do other people in this company have so much trouble with simple tasks?
Anathema because they're challenged.
Anathema and you're just too smart.
I'll agree with half of that.
Stop underestimating yourself -P.
Thats my job.
Gotta start your nerevar cosplaying early.
So TIL that with detect demons up I see a billion invisible Lens and Safety net NPCs in the giant eye boss fight.
Boss mechanic related ?
I was about to say.
Yeah if you fall off the platform you just get ported up so that will be the nets.
And if the boss misses you with his skillshot it bounces back.
Just amused they are all demons.
Cooked_Auto omg rumours that GW will start selling 'on demand' copies of all their old OOP models o_0.
Also FWs new AoS army has had its first release.
And here I spent like £10 getting a scratched Johnny marine for that silly /tg/ WIP meme.
Wonder if it includes specialist games models too.
We'll see next week.
I'd buy some Battlefleet Gothic models if they are available.
Might just be better off waiting until they relaunch it.
Bloodbowl is possibly slated for a November release.
The Black Library coming soon page pretty much confirms it.
I could see BFG relaunched as a boardgame.
It most likely will be considering Blood Bowl and Necromunda will be relaunched.
Wait what Necromunda too?
Pretty much the plan is to relaunch all the Specialist games afaik.
There's been rumors about Necromunda at least and I know I've seen talk about Epic.
Will be very surprised if Inquisitor gets renewed.
Well with 56mm models at least.
Considering GW now has their RPG licenses back? Who knows.
Back to probably do dumb things with them.
It's been improved.
This guy is great.
Britain isn't crowded.
It has 3 major crowded cities.
The country itself is fucking EMPTY.
Eh 51st most dense out of ~250ish p.
Not really convincing me there.
Yeah but remember Scotland skews it by having large uninhabitable mountains.
Your country is basically all habitable.
Yeah it is now.
We had to make it habitable first.
And i don't mean we had to cut down a forest.
England itself has a higher population density than the netherlands.
I'd be much more interested in england vs randstad.
Than england vs my whole country.
But i have no clue where to find that statistic.
Wikipedia doesn't have density for randstad listed.
That's basically 4 nearby cities right?
Seems fairer to compare the london metropolitan area p.
Anathema its 4 cities and the massive natural area they are not allowed to grow into.
Randstad == edge city.
The British government has told the London School of Economics that it does not want non-UK nationals to work on a Brexit-related project BuzzFeed News has learned.
Yeah they're biased anathema.
Ftrbzzs do you have snow yet?
Seems early yet for snow.
Scotlands finest.
MoonWolf> god that goatee looks dumb on Top Gear Man <- duh.
Top Gear is White Male Mid-life Crisis the Show.
Now with actual attempt at growing a cool beard.
Ooh endless space 2 is early access.
Doesn't have Horatio or Amoeaba.
Worst endless space.
No Horatio? surely they will add them in later.
I will use my user voice points to ask for Horatio.
Must resist urge to link in work yammer on monday.
? this is gonna be good when it is finished.
And Nythendra has been 3 manned.
!note Noelor.
MairBear in fact considering the current situation survival hunters are the most at risk of death.
So hunters do great dps at the moment.
But apparently they don't get invited to Mythic +.
Purely because they might be bad at barrage.
Or these forums are full of shit that's a total plausible explanation.
Forums are full of shit.
No clue about the getting invited though.
Ahahahahaha. XCOM2 LP people has to watch this.
Oh my god this entire LP.
Oh my god hitler why.
Well i need to start watching this.
It gets better.
SunTiger was Mehrunes Dagon a tarrasque?
Minus the swalling plus some moving things around.
This week's episode of 6FU has a demonic tarrasque.
What level are they ?
And I recognised the conditions require an icon result thing.
Yeah its pretty excuse the term.
I like it.
Also i don't kno wabout the 6fu party.
But your party was pretty fucking lethal for just the 3 of you.
It's bigger than ours yeah.
Wizard Sorcerer Necromancer 3rd party version of Monk 2x Bard Ranger.
No lack of damage then.
I hope that tarrasque got some serious damage / health / action economy upgrades.
Seems like extra attacks yes.
Also in any given fight a couple members of the party won't be fighting it because they'll get distracted by trying to solve the problem in a plot way.
The trassaque normally gets one close and one melee attack per round.
I move that into one proper turn one standard action.
In this case the sorcerer and wizard are trying to banish the demon part.
Against that i'd be happy to turn it into two proper turns.
Top tier transmogs.
Did you finish The Gates Are Open?
ChaosSmurf also check Pennine linked from there.
You're probably looking at something in 2017.
There's also stuff later this year in Dundee but that's a lot further away for you.
Did you finish The Gates Are Open? <- they're closed again.
They only had to add some rules to reality and on the whole things are pretty okay now.
Except the part where Noelor shoved Azura's Star into Umbra.
That might have some consequences.
Also we're the new Tribunal or whatever!
And there's a meteor headed for Vivec.
Yeah but that was always going to happen.
The meteor thing.
Which our 2/3rds Argonian party would just use as an opportunity to fill Morrowind with lizards.
The saviours of morrowind two argonians and a khajit.
Its a bit unorthodox.
I openly despised the dunmer at every opportunity!
This doesn't matter to the dunmer this is how they act to non dunmer all the time anyway.
Yeah that seems like the sort of thing our pseudo-god would say to us.
What happened to the meteor in canon again?
Vivec disapears somewhere around the oblivion crisis and 50 years later is falls on vivec the city blows up it up and triggers Red Mountain into erupting.
Then the argonians invade.
5 not 50*.
Oh pretty much exactly the same then?
I explicitly didn't want big hero lore figures like Vivec or Nerevar walking around to steal all the thunder.
So you got a single big fuck you deadra out of vivec and he disapeared.
Exposition in a letter.
Its very TES.
Nerevar never showed up right?
Never showed up.
Off doing important Nerevarine things.
Like fucking with Daedra of madness whose name I can't spell and buidling houses?
According to in setting explenations which may well be wrong he's off in Akavir japan land doing Stuff.
Also we're the new Tribunal or whatever! <--- wait wat.
The Tribunal Temple named them the Successors.
Because they each ended up with an artifact of the Tribunal.
Who was Almalaxia?
With my bullshit wizard lizard.
Your bullshit wizard lizard who weilded Penumbra and was somehow the most martial of the party.
Nah that was Mair.
Did you see your melee damage numbers when you actually swung the thing ?
Mair could do one impressive burst.
You just did impressive hits every time.
Anyway Noelor got almalexia's mask mairbear got vivecs spear glenn got sotha sils mask.
Would have expected vivec and SS to be the other way around.
Nah SS is purely a scholar represent the mage part of the TES martial/sneaky/magic divide.
So it went to glenn who played a straight up wizard.
While Vivec is hardly a cleric clerics are split between two disciplines.
One of which is martial and this fits vivecs themes of duality better.
Can I get away with having a third GT instead of dinner?
Why would you even ask that?
MoonWolf wait is Almalexia the thief constellation one?
But you went with duality instead of thief because we killed our thief.
More or less.
If you want to get very technical with his title of warrior-poet vivec probably best fits a spear weilding bard.
But you know.
Didn't exactly have one of those around.
Tralen died in glorious combat real early on.
I got really close to killing mairbear a few times.
And you did kill me!
I think you killed Mair twice after that in fact.
But I managed to bullshit him back to life.
Nobody can claim i went easy on you.
Noelor I think I could but I had some toast and peanut butter anyway.
Mostly it was crits though.
Literally all three of those occasions.
Noelor probably hosting some friends from Glasgow for hogmanay so wont be doing anything else that is arranged.
!note MairBear probably hosting some friends from Glasgow for hogmanay so wont be doing anything else that is arranged.
You'd be welcome too but it could get crowded...
The Battlezone Redux LP is quite magical.
Anathema it's October we don't have snow yet -P.
Slept less than 4 hours last night.
OTOH I won an auction for £270 of plastic tanks for £155 + shipping.
Do you even have time to paint all your army mens ?
I might finish everything in 2016 if I stop playing WoW >_>.
All the Warhammer at least.
Anathema I slept poorly as well.
Slowly getting depressed about finding a house.
Still got Battle for Zycanthus and Kingdom Death Monster.
Ftrbzzs Im surprised it has taken this long to sink in.
I get depressed looking at rentals within 15 minutes.
Anathema it comes and goes now the frustration has built up for ages so I'm getting a big drop.
Robot progress from the weekend.
Anathema looks great.
Of course you can't really see it that well with the faceplate covering it but oh well p.
Anathema apparently 'Chewin' the Fat' has made it onto netflix.
MairBear I saw D.
I had a quote in my mind and thought it's from the Manhattan Project or something.
Looked it up turns out Jurassic Park.
I'm Good at attribution.
Basically the same movie.
Both about scientists doing things they shouldn't be doing.
That is in fact the quote in question.
I was paraphrasing it to reference Greggs though.
See perfectly understandable confusion.
Because they have produced an onion bhaji burrito.
That too is something that should never have been attempted.
Greggs... finds a way.
Lo I am become Greggs destroyer of stotties.
Greggs... finds a way <- i wish they did not.
Minister its like you don't trust PatternSpider.
PatternSpider is a dubious creation.
Two criteria in a row!
1 in 110 odds.
Thats pretty damn likely on the whole ?
Hitting a bit below 1% odds isn't mind bendingly unlikely.
You take your logic out of here.
I'm just mad my 1/110 double-crit was on randomly choosing things to spot-check.
So what was this all for ?
I'm just mad my 1/110 double-crit was on randomly choosing things to spot-check.
So what was this all for ?
Random spot checking for work stuff.
I bought more models because I caught an amazing idea for a squad conversion.
Thats how they get you.
You know those old people who die and their relatives find old bedrooms stacked full of newspapers and magazines? I'm gonna be like that for plastic models.
Oh come on that was a 33.33333 chance.
You had a break in between them so that doesn't work that way.
Fricken £30 to add a single hold bag on easyjet these days.
They need to make money somewhere.
And its in the extras.
Oh well bit the bullet and will be seeing my family for a week.
Daaaamn that's pretty if real.
Look at those pointy nipples.
Most people can drive to the mall without an epic soundtrack booming behind them. while this is true Scion EA text.
I feel behoven to point out that such a thing definitely makes a drive *better*.
Now I have to go see if I can find expected infant vocabulary in my linguistics book.
Outerspacebeing Fight Team Two is a pretty good game.
Oh my god.
However the name just can't compare too Outerspacebeing Fight Team Badguys Not Known.
I feel that The very mean gunshooting car really encapsulates the sectopod.
Anathema You should really check the Warhammer TV FB room btw.
I mean REALLY check out the new video.
Yay I got enough AP today to hit the first gold trait on Frost + Mourne.
So I now have *two* Sindragosa buttons on my bars!
OP blizz plz nerf.
Exalted started up again Janos having finished moving.
It was on last week but I missed it because I didn't find out until I'd already agreed to raid.
But apparently Janos finally managed to infect one of the PCs with gremlin syndrome.
Obviously it's our Starmetal.
Because she wasn't creepy enough before.
ChaosSmurf dyk what game this even is about?
This is exactly what I needed.
Cooked_Auto I really want that model.
Plastic sisters I want to believe.
Cooked_Auto best thing is how the original picture of magnus is clearly taken from inside the red bin.
I hate the world.
....pound now down 17.6% versus dollar since 23 June actual text on the tweet I linked.
I want my money back >C.
Or at least the lost equivalent value v.
If only it worked that way.
Try a class action lawsuit against the goverment for brexit.
I don't think that would save me any money. Quite the opposite in fact.
Maybe the 52%?
Hard to explicitly name them though since you know votes are anonymous and all.
Just sue specifically Boris and Farage.
Also i doubt you can sue voters for voting.
That'd undermine the point of the system really fast.
Welp. I'm sold.
I hope they are plastic.
>plastic karskrin and vahallans.
Pretty sure they'll be in resin.
That is OK.
Basically not metal is what I want.
From what I heard this will be the new Finecast.
But we'll find out on friday.
Mfw I just bought some cadians empire bits and skitarri bits to kitbash some veterans / storm troopers |.
Oh yeah I grabbed a couple of Skitari heads a while ago. Should see how well they fit on Scions.
You're going to have to do some serious shaving to get them fit on Cadians though.
Nah want to use empire Greatsword bodies for carapace armour.
Could work I guess.
Hmmm less certain.
Well stormtrooper / inquisitors.
Damn bid £12 for an already painted Vanquisher tank lost and the winner was £12.50 >_>.
Anathema sniped ?
I still dont get how I managed to win those Kasrkin a week ago because I fully expected to get sniped.
Oh hey overwatch halloween event is on.
Time to get really angry at videogames for the next few weeks.
MoonWolf gonna have to skip tomorrows game... grandmother's taken ill.
Quite possibly it's hard to know but she's beyond the age where any thing can quickly spiral.
Strangely adorable.
Oh man that reinhart.
All of them are pretty great.
Oh god I missed the mei halloween hilight earlier.
Thats not mei at all!
Since its impossible to find these without some assshole talking over them ignore the chinese.
Kain_Spoo oh god thats amazing.
Even with the gangirl bait maincast and weird sparkling everywhere nanbaka continues being great in the second episode.
Ftrbzzs do you want some fintrade gossip?
Bum my jacket wasn't delivered because I wasn't home and I guess neither of my neighbours were in either.
Rien de Mair?
MoonWolf gonna have to skip tomorrows game... grandmother's taken ill.
My bard nearly died in DD last night.
We discovered another minor good idea buried among the shitshow that is 5e.
There's no tracking negative hp.
So how does being dead work ?
Instead if a single blow would deal your entire HP pool in damage to you when unconscious that gibs you.
And similarly if the blow that knocks you out deals your maximum HP + your current HP that one-shots you instead of knocking you out.
So you only get killed by *really* big hits.
Also it has death saves.
So how did you get hit for over 100% of your hp ?
Similar to 13A but you need to succeed three times to get up rather than once for no good reason.
I said nearly!
So how did you nearly get hit for over 100% of your hp ?
I was knocked out by a Black Pudding's crit.
While on kinda low HP.
Then failed a couple death saves.
I think if you applied this system to 13th age i could not pheasably kill people in combat.
Aside from failed death save chains where nobody can get you up.
We have way more HP in 13A though.
Remember that in DD5 HP are rolled for again.
Yeah but more importantly monster damage is very fixed and nothing level apropriate is going to do an HP pool worth of damage.
Unless it crits.
Or you're a necromancer.
Yeah but even a low hp character is going to be closer to 120% to 130% of hp.
Crit on a necromancer thats really low might do it.
In any case I've told the GM I'm probs not going to play DD again because that's like... two positive interactions with its rules system?
Over two levels or so of play.
I can't even remember what the other one was might have been the multiclass system.
Hah there's an excerpt in my textbook from a Tudor scholar comparing English to other European languages English turning out to be the best of course.
It is hilariously racist in a 17th century way.
Dutch is manlike but withal very harsh as one ready at every word to pick a quarrel.
Noelor i'll except the harsh. thats about it.
MoonWolf yeah 17th century tudors don't know shit.
Either that or 17th century netherlands was a very different place.
Which I mean probably a little but still.
Omg the halloween Dad 76 spray =3.
Also the nAna one tbh.
The Ana one is great.
Oh cool I didn't know James Mendez Hodes was working on Scion.
Oh boy a 100ft Robot Golf stream.
That's my evening.
Different golf game.
Dammit Fae with your deceptive stream names.
I'm sure there is other poeple playing gundam golf.
Did someone say fjärnskeggl?
What about me?
Also today has a world quest where some seal-form druids are hypnotically slept.
So we rouse them... with a club >.<.
This seems highly relevant. At least to some certain people <- that mairbear.
Really enjoying crushing dreams of murloc decks in the tavern brawl with maelstrom portal D.
Dob oi gtfo.
I really enjoyed all the direct damage spell decks on the first day that i destroyed with light of the naaru priest.
Keijo sure is something.
You forgot the seventeen bajillion exclamation marks.
MoonWolf I ran into one of those priests.
I realised so I just stopped attacking and built my board.
So he conceded.
Only works against mindless agro.
Anything with board presence just kills you.
I went for the unconventional read bad deck of addled grizzly.
Accidentally did the hard mode brawl in overwatch.
I was wondering why we almost lost.
Season ending in 28 minutes Hrmmm.
I don't think I'll get 26-70 on a fresh d3 character in that.
I Dont think I have won any normal matches today in overwatch.
What the fuck is it with my teams.
Last game was 3 hanzos.
One that 4 mercys.
Dagoth is sending out some pretty weird dreams recently.
Also the Heart of Lorkhan has really shrunk.
Oh whoops Smurf made an article on the very same thing.
36MB/s download speeds are great when modding bethesda games.
If you are downloading texture overhauls.
2.2gb of new weapon textures for a mod compilation.
This mod requires a 1 hour video explaining how to extract some BAs and merge them not sure I can be bothered with that |.
Especially since the first time I did it I seemed to of fucked up and got a CTD within 10m.
Ok think I fixed it.
War of the commonwealth is great my world is so dangerous now and I haven't even gone to suri.
What does it do ?
Frodans jacket is neon pink and his hair is purple.
Frodan has the inverse of my colour scheme today.
The concept of friendship was invented in 2015 by Toby Fox I see.
MairBear its true.
Toby did invent frienship.
Well I have now proven that I use enough bandwith to use up my data plan If I forget to turn on my w-lan while at home.
There must always be a Mei-Ling.
I would pay legit real money for mei lich king voice pack.
In either game.
In addition to all the functions of a normal smartphone the iGjallar has crystal clear reception no matter where the Scion goes and never loses signal Scion.
Does it have a Gjallar FIeld as well to protect you from demons?
MoonWolf did you hear Nexus hired the guy behind Mod Organiser?
Doesn't suprise me.
Probably means mod oragnizers dead though.
So apparently Drumpf mains Hanzo.
They might have changed something.
Oh is it not working?
I was just wondering if he was in the game or not.
And assumed not from the result.
He's a legendary that kills monsters.
Is that not just Big Game?
He's also TERRIBLE.
This explains why I couldn't remember him.
I mean yeah.
Hearthhead redid their website last couple or days so maybe the search has different api or somethng.
One of those rounds. my team went full mei.
Was it ameizing ?
Well we did win.
Woo I can finally equip 2 legendaries!
IF I FOUND ONE.
I'm still not convinced legendaries aren't some sort of ruse.
I heard some ofthem are best in slot.
This is great.
ChaosSmurf dyk what presumably minor swear D.Va says in that one protoss voiceline?
I have 80 hs golds for any willing takers.
Aww yiss.
Xenophile Fallen Empires will no longer attack regular empires just for slaving/purging now I can purge all the filthy xenos.
You mean you couldn't before?
Well the Fallen Empires would tell me to stop or they'd squash me if it wasn't already late-game.
Welp. My grandmother on my dad's side just passed away.
It was bound to happen and I haven't seen her for a year or two after she got put in a home due to her dementia. So I'll have to help dad empty her room on thursday.
MairBear can i interest you in 80 childrens video card game moneys credits ?
Enjoy your golds.
I love my rez deck when it works.
It so unfair.
Sorry dog but thats the rules.
Yesss the asura lp as at the yasha sections.
That better be a video LP it wouldn't be the same without the music.
It is yes.
Even comes with commercial breaks.
Noelor GlennCuttlefish.
I don't think i'd call it that Noelor.
Oh yeah game is defs on tonight right?
I've no reason right now for it not to be.
Random piece of advice don't walk two parliament buildings plus a there and back commute in one day. your legs might hate you for it.
He thought the paint would flow better in the can warmed up. It blew the oven off the wall and embedded metal in the conservatory windows as well as covering the kitchen in black. don't put paint cans in the oven.
Anathema it did flow better though.
Oh fuck the terrifying psychotic faerie dragon bint is in the emerald dream.
Nowhere is safe.
I broke my FO4 somehow shooting Raiders in the head is doing like 15% damage.
Also even with some bits of dreadnought armour they shoot me dead real fast.
This is normal difficulty ¬_¬.
Finally realistic combat!
Just ask any skyrim realistic mod author.
If I could shoot them in head dead easily too I'd be OK with it.
But I can't!
The most damaging weapon I actually have ammo for is a heavy string hunting crossbow.
Not sure whether the troublesome mod is the extra guns one or War For The Commonwealth though.
Ok so. game tonight?
Game is going to have its tradition 20 to 30 minute delay.
While i plan ahead a bit more.
As that's about how much longer my dinner wants to stay in the oven.
What are you ovening ?
A courgette... thing.
The recipe says gratin but I don't believe it having googled that word.
We may have had this conversation before.
Yeah it doesn't magically become a gratin just because you put some cheese on.
MoonWolf we hear you at least.
Probably just an issue with the outbound audio.
Hm this sugarfree pastry was pretty dull.
Yeah pretty damn bland. Good thing it dad brought back home a doggiebag of more normal stuff too. Also kind of hope that I was allowed to grab from them. Guess we'll find out tomorrow P.
Parents are asleep in this case.
Woah that marble effect is wicked.
Anathema pretty cool.
Omfg MB 2 is on Steam.
Cooked_Auto I like how the made to order stuff is sold out |.
Because its most likely made in batches.
Notice it takes 28 days for it to get shipped.
Yeah I know.
But they could do the thing that this other website does where you can place an order but it doesn't go unless x many other people also do it or w/e.
Smogon finally admits it's a kangaroo court.
In a 13th Age campaign I ran one PC was an ex-Elven Male Model the most famous of all in the world because he was the only elven beefcake available among a horde of Legolases. Elves in 13th Age can teleport. His battles with paparazzi were epic. heh.
Well that's horrifying.
His face implants are malfunctioning.
Needs a firmware update.
Also the most emotion he'll ever show.
So I got my F4 mods sorted last night got a normalised damage in all difficulties mod and a weapon rebalancing one to replace the other weapon mod I had. So I'll have less variety now but enemies shouldn't be bullet sponges.
Got started last night Survival mode. Forgot to configure War For the Commonwealth immediatly and died to a pack of mole-rats outside the vault one of them had a mine stuck to it.
Started a settlement at the red rocket truck stop got a settler straight away! Been building what I can very nervous about leaving since everything is dangerous and all I had was a 10mm pistol.
Was building at night and I could see a pack of ghouls in the forest including a glowing one. Luckily they didn't come near.
Managed to build a couple of turrets.
Headed back to santuary for things to salvage and there was a couple of super mutants fishing or w/e. Surprised them with a drug buffed sneak attack and a grenade and got one of them and the two dogs quickly. The other one ran under the bridge and almost killed me with his rifle before I got him.
So now I have a hunting rifle which is good. It has a lot of damage but I don't have a lot of ammo. and I'm sort of running out of food. Gonna have to make a trip to that nearby farm next time I play and steal all their crops.
I used scaffolding to get on top of the RR building though so now I have a little cabin up there and I can took around since my rifle has a scope.
Really fun though! Even if every single noise I hear at night is terrifying.
I think anathema finally caught whatever it is i have for TES games.
I also got a C_A approved mod.
Bullets have travel time and drop-off.
MoonWolf what is that?
An addition to modding.
I've been mod crazy since Morrowind I just have less free time to spend setting it up p.
Bluh gotta phone the nhs physio people to get in their system so I can book my x-ray on hold.
And they are only open 1pm-5pm.
Also the music keeps randomly fading out so I think I'm gonna get a person and then it comes back.
There is something uniquely infuriating about buisnesses and orgs that provide services mostly to working adults only being open during weekday buisness hours.
10 minutes on hold so far.
This is exactly why I used my BUPA to see a physio I got it approved and booked in less than 10 minutes.
Also who the fuck picks orchestral music for hold music.
Pick something constrained to the range of frequencies phones use so it doesn't sound like piss.
Troll'd all that time to be told 'fill in a form and send it in'.
Oh well now I caqn book the xray atleast.
That was much less painless 820 next tuesday.
Anathema what is the xray for?
Have you recently injured it or is it the same you went to physio for?
Hmm google estimates a 30m cycle.
Physio thinks something serious is going on ?
Physio doesn't know I went back to my GP yesterday.
Theory from physio impinged nerve but who knoes.
I just want it to end I miss lifting weights not being in constant pain.
I too would miss not being in constant pain.
I hate the modern internet.
Ooh skyrim on the Switch.
Actual video.
Welp I'll probably buy that on launch.
Ooh skyrim on the Switch <- huh.
Did not see that coming.
141525 › anathema bullets have travel time and drop-off - To be fair I don't give a damn about that in most other games p.
So I don't see it'd be a me approved mod just because I play the one game where that is mostly relevant.
Oh it runs on the nvidia Tegra.
So its another console thats basically just a pc.
Nah tegra is nvidia's ARM cpu / gpu offering.
The Nexus 7 used a tegra.
Welp going to my first burial in November.
Well that was mindfart.
I dunno almost looks like legit.
More curious if those are new blister packs for new models or new blister packs for old models making a return.
Which would make you feel more despair ?
Old models a lot of the sculpts for sisters aren't even that good.
I'd probably feel despair over the former because it'd be plastic models I kind of want to buy but have no real funds for.
Anathema probably because nobody has sculpted new ones for them in decades.
Funny enough there's even rumors going around of price cuts and I'm inclined to believe them.
There will be many more events throughout the year ahead. Sales and cut prices too.
I mean yes take it all with a powerfist full of salt but with how things are currently going I am fully willing to believe them.
I can believe the premium start collecting boxes.
Maybe price cuts for certain kits.
To be fair they are already slowly slashing prices.
I'm still mad that there is a Guard formation requiring a minimum of like 170 infrantry models.
Its nothing massive but a lot of the deals are deals.
Well duh it's the Guard. Half their thing is massive infantry groups.
There's always this one otherwise P.
170 models at £18 for 10?
Well its not a formation you use to get into the army by a longshot.
It's fine to include as an option but not as like the core of the decurian-style formations.
I think it's actually worse too it's 3 of x where x is an infantry platoon with 5 squads for the Core then you need a Command one.
IIRC I don't own the book.
Core IG or the Cadian book?
They are in the mont'ka supplement I believe.
There are no formations in the IG codex itself.
Which I think later got compiled into Codex Cadia.
That isn't a thing unless it's PDF only.
Well it was a thing for a while at least.
IOS only it seems.
BL has it as epub3.
I obviously have the PDF.
Not too keen on the new Cadian colour scheme though. Prefer the classic 8th.
MoonWolf is Skyrim EE using the FO4 engine?
Its a continuation of the skyrim enigne.
Though some of the graphics code was probably ported.
If that makes sense to you.
But there are negine improvements?
Its the same engine in the way that its been the same engine since morrowind.
But its not the same engine as fallout in that the fallout game has some pretty serious differences in its datafiles and game mechanics and other hardcoded shit.
Ok but it's not just we're bundling hi-res textures enjoy.
Yet existing mods will still work?
They just changed rendering stuff.
Added god rays better dof stuff like that.
Maybe once the jacket I returned gets refunded I can buy a new GPU instead and just be cold for a few months.
A bunch of things people used sweetfx and enb for.
Man I wish I can add an ENB to my fallout.
Sweetfx has a much lower performance hit.
You might be able to do that.
I can't run the game on high settings atm.
Help consdering codegenning a type at runtime.
Its not worth it.
Its never worth it.
What’s worse he started an internship program.
I guess this shop is really happy to exist?
Noelor well they sell all the staple consumables they probably do good buisness.
Th is is a pretty cool promotion.
Pick a champion and then get packs for every win they pick up in the tournament.
Also a free pack for just picking one.
At least i can participate in this.
Unlike the fucking new priest hero that i actually want to have.
This is p great.
So far this series has been zany adventures in weird places.
Suddenly this episode is hokuto no magical girl.
And then it went to places.
Going to places.
Arrived at places.
BUT WHY STOP THERE.
Bonus points for mad max as fuck traffic cones.
And then it got just fabulous.
Why did they add sound dings to b.net.
Nobody wanted this.
Nobody needed this.
Blizzard wanted it.
They also added voip.
MoonWolf are you RTing SU spoilers into my timeline!?
Spoiler green one is in an episode and mills her arms.
Nah not angry enough.
Nah I just came across the joke on TDI's twitter in this case.
I forgot to redo my Warhammer character game is tonight.
Gues patternspider is rolling some dice during lunch.
Nah I'm keeping stats I made a char but last session I mentioned there is a gypsy career and the GM said that that would actually be perfect.
!note MairBear.
Oh man the meteor shower is tonight as well!?
Well i don't know about over there.
But over here we are not seeing that shit.
Cloudy all day.
Mostly cloudy throughout the day. bum.
Anathema super cloudy here as well.
Feels like being in the UK <3.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish.
Oops forgot link.
MairBear my link is the superior link.
It is c.
You win this one.
Yah i do.
Also if you have time to win a HS game sometime in the future.
I'd be very grateful.
I wasn't expecting the twist on the first one.
MoonWolf I'll grab tea but then sure.
Oh or it will download a patch at ludicrously slow speed.
Oh yeah they patched in some more quests.
And murloc card changes.
Hearthstone now playable.
I think my sound system has reached new levels of jury rigging.
Since I cant plug the 2.1 system directly to my computer and I dont really want to keep changing cables I now have my PC sending audio singla to the old amplifier that then routes the signal to its speakers and then to the new amplifier and those speakers.
MairBear your rank 22 any ranked game should be a free win.
MoonWolf new D3 season.
Anything new in it ?
Creepy ass Andarial arm wings instead of a pet.
Don't know of any big changes to existing things or new things.
I hope my neighbours down the hill like hotline miami soundtrack.
Sound doesn't really care about gravity glenn.
Well yes but the uphill neighbours are behind more walls.
I technically also dont really have uphill neighbours.
Who's Han Solo?
's a good start.
There are 60 Styles currently in the game haha.
Never stop adding styles gnome.
Its grown a lot then.
Styles not archetypes.
I'll get to eat for another year and you'll get to play this game! pretty good trade.
That win streak bug that came and went is just like the tol barad honour spike in my experience.
Win streak bug ?
Reports came after today's patch that win streak bonus stars were coming 1 win earlier than before.
Undocumented change that was a bug since hotfixed.
Promotion now comes with a heal instead of having to choose.
TS' eloise down 8-4 in a last hero standing playoff went with unicorn priest as last deck.
There was a divine fire inner spirit wombo getting stuff to 22-ish with faceless shamblers prepped. maly druid down to 7 life scores a mulch off raven idol before winning by conventional means.
Noelor upon reconsideration the title image of panic at the dojo doesn't feature nearly enough fire pits and rubble on the ground.
Highway Ninjas The Ninjas of the Road Stooges yeah I'm going to run this premade game at some point.
BULLSHIT DROPS I HATE RNG GODDAMNIT.
Not that I am upset about total lack of trinkets or anything but.
See also In mail a player’s other characters have been added to the auto-complete list.
Which like I'd forgotten wasn't the norm.
Oh hey know what I haven't read in ages?
Cutesad futurist lesbians webcomic.
Its been very feels lately.
Its been more feels than usual lately ?
I said it was feels!
I like how the main character in iZombie is called 'Liv Moore'.
IZombie is a very subtle show.
It's a great show.
!note Noelor.
I should read more of that.
Watching leftover hots vods from last night first ban zarya first pick tychus.
Man I have been away from this game's fucking meta so bloody long.
Mimiron now has hati essence swapper reset dialogue useful.
Oh that is handy.
Now we'll be able to make our pets reasonable again the next time they bug out.
But why would you want to do that.
Well the lesser classes weren't too impressed by all the roaring double thoks running about.
I mean I didn't really care about that.
But after a bit having a giant turtle occupy most of my screen makes gameplay a bit harder than it should be =P.
Okay heroes brawl successful matchmaking shoving 5 man premade vs solo q with 3 ppl on blue team fucking off at loading screen.
So if you want to play a neat little really casual indie horror game try oxenfree.
Its like 5bucks on steam atm.
CiVI keeps crashing =<.
Specifically when I try to advance turn in my Sumeria game.
Try loading an older save ?
I did still crashes after the same number of turns.
Just can't handle that much science or something.
Probably an opponent finishing a building/tech that does something weird.
So I started a new one as the Aztec spreading the Teotl to all corners of the world.
Religion for everyone!
This started off by France getting the first religion by way of Stonehenge so I spent from ancient times to when people started caring about warmongery harassing Paris so she couldn't get an economy rolling.
One of the unique powers for the Aztec is that their eagle warriors when they beat up enemy combat forces have a chance of turning them into captured builders.
So my peripheral cities are built on French blood =D.
Fuck the french anyway.
Alternatively you're just multicultural.
Can't believe I'll soon not be able to watch this whenever I remember it exists.
Noelor a real shame.
= I am not getting my blizzcon hearthstone packs.
Disappointed in you thijs.
Conspiracy of getting paid off to throw games to save blizz all those pack costs.
Hmm this is pretty cool the host they have on the starcraft stage doing post-game interviews does her own korean translation.
Took them long enough to get one of those.
Not really sure by this paladin deck. control nzoth murloc. so greedy.
Oh man insane studio for the overwatch world cup.
Noelor cars are rubble.
Oh turns out I'm running Panic at the Dojo next Sunday.
Example adventure ?
Anyone fancy a game of wizard poker for mutual gold gain?
If i can see you beat someone else afterwards.
That was fast =P sure moon.
I'm arguing with my fallout 4 installation atm.
Need a distractin.
Currently watching a stream of Forza Horizon sponsored not really sponsored by Hatsune Miku.
It's part of an Extra Life stream.
CiVI's AI is weird.
I converted the USA to worship of the Teotl.
So Roosevelt started pumping out missionaries of the Teotl.
And then... sent them back over the ocean.
To try to convert my cities?
Your worshipping WRONG.
I don't have time for an American Schism I'm trying to convert the English.
Good luck with that.
This has tradionally not worked out for other religions.
Well nearly all the other religions are being followed by the majority populations of 0 cities.
The one exception being the Jewish city of Granada which I've been unable to find but which is still pumping out apostles to try and reclaim their holy land =<.
Grabbed a black knight as a 'tech' choice in the tavern brawl. rewarded when opponent dropped ironbark and I got the avenue to push lethal D.
It was my first legendary.
It has a special place in my heart.
Oh I found Amsterdam and they want my intercontinental trade ships.
Sadly I don't actually have ports on my side of that ocean.
I'm doing a domination run.
Just met the last civ and they're already at war with me before we'd even met.

Hrmm caster on the OW world cup just called eichenwald with a sh- phonic on second syllable.
I KNOW RIGHT?
Being familiar with the sch- phoneme from german and assuming similarity.
While being monolingual english and therefore not having a basis for pronouncing any syllable with h in as a plosive.
I visited a marsh in March going to go back in 5 months so I can visit a marsh in March in March.
I hate you a little right now.
Was actually there for a small indie acoustic guitar concert / festival thing.
Just listen to this guy.
He's pretty good.
A shame he's only one guitar because that piece really should not be limited to one instrument no matter the fact that he can carry two lines of play on a fucking guitar.
He also did this bit where he talked about some american civil war memorial event in the past where they played the anthems or w/e of both the union and the confederacy to keep everyone happy.
So he played a few seconds of each.
And then played them both at the same time o_0.
Can't find it on youtube though.
This guy played too.
He is also amazing.
103349 › anathema I visited a marsh in March going to go back in 5 months so I can visit a marsh in March in March - but are you going to march through it?
Marching in a marsh is pretty hard.
Cooked_Auto omg great idea.
SunTiger there's a wooden walkway.
Noelor I am sure you will appreciate this also too many images to link at the same time.
These are all the worst.
Then I'm sure Noelor will love them.
Granted I meant more take a look at the rest of it if you found something for OTS.
Also cute ?
That too yes.
Anathema my latest box of Bertrand contained a bonus sample pack of double protein mix - which you're welcome to if you come visit =V.
Noelor re EGS.
Fucking commit to your damn triad already Dan.
Or stop teasing it.
Its already full of weird transformations and the main characarter spends significant amounts of time switching between male and female forms.
I don't think three people in a relationship is going to be a big deal at this point.
There's a vaguely shippy pic of them every few months on the patreon too.
Ok but them being in a relationship also requires time to progress.
And this is a webcomic.
Oh yeah we recently managed to go to a New Day.
It only took literally 6 months.
Oh hey someone is Kickstarting a game I literally have to back.
But its already funded.
10 times over.
That intro video is trying WAY to hard for atristic.
Yeah it actually gets into realtalk after about a minute.
And then at about three cats walk over the game?
Yeah i aw that.
Noelor also colour sorted bookshelf.
A choice I can respect.
It seems inefficient but it is pretty.
Though not abide in my own home.
This does not suprise me.
The new Paper Mario is a real good game.
Having watched TieTuesday's youtube archive of streaming nearly the whole thing now.
Well okay then.
Sadly i do not have a device capable of playing it.
Noelor> I see you frodanned your hair.
Neon purple ?
Sec I'll tweet what I FB'd.
Not sure i'd say its ghoulish but it is a bit offputting in a vague way.
Like your face and expression are too ... flat ?
Unsure how to express.
Yeah I'm not good at photos.
Trying to look zombish it definitely doesn't come off right.
But I'm trying to get more at ease with my face so????
Nice hair though.
Oh dear.
This is nto going to end well.
Twitter plays 'probably build an sao racist chatbot'.
BwaS eh it'll have more character than most sao characters then at least.
I dunno is Twitter racist that much more complex than Wants to erp with his sister?
It's mostly the other way round in sao.
Wants to erp with her brother?
I'm guessing it's still a nii-/imouto- pair though.
Wouldn't want to rock the boat too hard.
Please stop being creepy japan.
Well he's mostly taken it's kind of an unrequited thing.
Also it's... not a hentai.
Well no if it was a hentai they'd already be having sex.
Tbh there was this scene it comes bloody close.
And this is why THE DATABASE is a better stuck in a videogame anime.
I think I found peak Japan.
Tie pointed out that the final boss theme is not at all dissimilar to Hopes and Dreams.
So now I have to go listen to that and get entirely too Determined before bed.
I'm not sure going to be too Determined is goof for sleep.
And yet such is my life.
Final boss theme of what exactly?
New paper mario.
It's only really similar in terms of instrumentation tbh.
And in being hype I guess but that's just par for the jrpg course.
Yeah not hearing it.
Still had to listen to it.
And will probably listen to nothing but UT soundtrack on my phone tomorrow.
What why help.
I have no help.
Only cries of why.
Also why SymmetraXJunkrat???
Order versus Chaos.
Makes about as much sense as any other pairing tbh.
Well that too yes.
So I wouldn't worry too much about it.
Well didn't manage to get everything in halloween event this year but got most of what I wanted.
Got fuck all in wow and dont think I will get the mount tomorrow either.
Noelor unfortunatly I wont be can't afford such a weekend trip on short notice $gf will be in NWC anyway for some other reason.
Tldr I need to spend less on plastic models.
Halloween decorations are still up in the office.
There is a skeleton directly in front of me but about half the office away.
And it has one bright blue eye.
Of all the duo-q comps I had to get in quickmatch it had to be a mercy pocketing a bastion on koth.
Overleague season 2 placement results landed silver-ish. only leavers I ended up getting in my matches were all on blue team and threw the game. go figure.
Red team leavers only ever in the setup phase to waste everyone's matchmaking time.
Story of my fucking life.
Evidently they looked at hero league and thought their AI leaver replacement system should be completely avoided.
Host a mythic plus run with my keystone... and I get gold and artifact power off 2 chests.
Getting ulti'd by ana.
Ana's ulti is a boost in damage speed attack speed and such.
Hollywood defence last night got stim'd while playing lucio.
I think she was aiming for the reinhardt.
Also had it as dva w/o mech.
BwaS but you can go SO FAST.
As a stimmed lucio.
Sure you can't do damage worth shit.
Been playing a whole lot of junkrat lately.
Starting to enjoy this character.
He's one of my favoured ones.
Mainly cos I cant aim for shit.
Grrr I just had to have one of those fucking I CAN'T BUILD A DECK TO SAVE MY FUCKING LIFE - YOU DO IT FOR ME! priests as gatekeeper to my card back for the season.
Fuck those cunts.
Its a bit early in the year for freezing weather.
Forgot to mention snow bot.
GlennCuttlefish barely any snow down here.
The wind is worse than the snow.
Its a regular winter wonderland here. that is to say a CM or two of snow. Which is entirely too much for my tastes.
It being a nonzero amount of snow.
China's name skills are much higher than us.
I blame character limit.
Geologists can't go 10 seconds without making a rock pun.
Never spending any time with geologists then.
Got my first legion legendary.
From LFR of all places.
我不想起名字 <- the best I couldn't think of a name.
Honestly dunno why banned.
Unless also coincidentally a cheater.
Nobody was banned for the names.
Some of those seemed like they might be.
Those were just notably interesting names in the log of poeple banned for cheating.
Reddit actually managing to do something halfway amusing.
Well I never.
Well its basically cheating by having a sticky at the top.
It'd be more impressive if they balanced it by hand.
They accurately don't trust the rest of reddit not to ruin it though.
If I had to guess.
They had r/pkmn on the 31st go with everyone's flair being that exeggutor.
And there was a bit of that chaining too.
With also a 'all shitposts allowed' yes more than usual purge mode.
I started watching The Genius yesterday.
So now I'm on ep4.
I heard good things about it.
Not really my thing though.
It has Tank! in its soundtrack.
It has a ton of things in its soundtrack.
I'm at the end of ep 4 and it suddenly devolved into a shipping montage of two of the players???
Because Korea I guess.
Korea our shows do the shipping for you!
Karazhan second boss where a one shot KO effect is avoided by standing in the fire to apply a debuff to you that hits you for 50% of your hp every tick.
Fuck this game design.
It's a bit of a shitter yeah.
P sure it's meant as a dps race.
I.. don't remember thatn from the 10 man.
Like between personal and healer cooldowns you get only one or two hits.
SunTiger re-designed Maiden.
Thats rather shit.
Maiden was a good if easy fight.
She's now tough.
So she spawns zones and those put a dot on you.
It used to be all about spreading out while dodging ground aoe zones.
Then she has a thing that disorients everyone in the group.
Also the whole raidwide except the tank stun.
So you have to a place the zones properly.
Sets up room wide consecrates you have to stand in to cancel out a partywide 30 sec stunlock during which she sets up a stupid large barrier to block interrupts against a TPK pulse.
B grab the dot just before the disorient.
Also yeah solid interrupt rotation.
Imo Kara isn't puggable yet in general.
So yeah fuck that french pug that didn't see that maybe the problem was a fire mage doing 150k.
There isn't supposed to be a dot.
Managing who or how to break the disorient is supposed to be the whole challenge.
Break it with cooldowns have a healer take ground aoe ticks tank wakes up a healer with boss aoe preload the tank with a ton of hots etc.
It pretty much is still the challenge though.
Just it's relocated to the healer.
This is dumb imho.
Gg blizzard ruined maiden of virtue.
I'm amazed at your memory of tacs for an unremarkable boss from 9yrs ago.
BwaS my first raid.
I'm fairly sure the fight as-was can't be done with modern ability pools and just 5 people.
From what you've just said.
But they shouldn't have turned it into a 5 man.
But also I think it is a good fight it's just... hard.
It was a very 10 man-ish place.
Its a good group size for it.
Too right. they took out hunter's tranq in legion. good luck running old magmadar.
It's a good five-man!
So long as you're an organised group.
And willing to spend 2-3 hours doing that.
It's fun and challenging.
Noelor a number of the fights rely on non tank raidmembers doing rotations on standing in stuff.
This will have to have changed to work in a 5 man.
Which means my favourite laser dragon is probably not the same fight anymore.
There is no laser dragon in the 5man.
Laserdragon's currently behind a secret timer.
Last I heard.
Dunno if people have been fighting him yet.
That's the other dragon.
But we certainly didn't.
Oh I did not know there were 2x dragons.
There is a laser dragon and a roof dragon.
Ok roofdragon is the bonus fight.
Where was laserdragon? upper part?
You took one staircase to netherspite or one staircase to chess and 35 card deck.
Wlel you did both.
Dont think my raids ever did.
And I farmed the bloody place most of TBC when the guild half-disbanded one night during ssc progression.
Now you get past Curator and the whole top part's been Escher'd to fuck.
I'm assuming chess event is out too.
And it's Shade Giant Library Wyrm Chess which is a puzzle trash room not a boss encounter Twisting Nether Battlecruiser Beholder.
What with 5 man.
I like new chess!
It's not at all chess.
It's a chess-based puzzly trash pack.
Twisting Nether Battlecruiser Beholder ... what ?
The final not-a-dragon boss is a Beholderesque demon.
It's a beholder who comes to the roof with a navy of Spears of Adun expies.
Who fights you in a protrusion of Karazhan into the Twisting Nether.
And also he's the commander of a fleet of demonic battlecruisers so parts of the fight are getting bombarded and having to chase him onto his ships.
Malch's still dead I guess?
Its just not the same if you can't be bombarded with abyssals.
That always fucking fall right on top of your raid so you have to relocatea.
And at least once every clear you die to that fight because the room didn't work out and you couldn't run anywhere safely.
That happens in a couple fights.
Curator and Maiden the worst I think?
You underestimate the size of the giant infernal hellfire circles.
And malchezars ability to throw you into them.
And his tendencey to set you hp to 1.
Unhealable mandatory don't take any damage buff.
Yeah that is not a thing.
... fuck won the tavern brawl on turn 3. well that was an easy pack.
20 in fact. and my second ever frothing.
I like tihs brawl.
The cancer is apparently dreadsteed.
Something satisfying about beating a cthun druid on ladder with a terribly half-hashed secret hunter at rank 23 wild.
I'm trying an egg/can't attack deck.
That's some of what I put in mine.
Okay c'thun also works well i seems.
Grim patrons are back.
Are they in fact.
Iiin hiiir? <- uuugh.
Oh nice the guards in suramar now have an additional icon above their head if they see through stealth when you have enemy health bars turned on.
Before the bar just blocked the little eye icon.
Man Develops Severe Hepatitis After Binging on Energy Drinks For Three Weeks o_0.
One can of monster has 200% RDA of niacin.
He was doing 4 or 5 cans a day.
Still shouldn't give you hepatitis should it.
I'm struggling to remember the third new opera encounter.
Romeo Juliet is now West Fall Story Wizard of Oz is now Wicked.
Wolf is ???
It's beauty and the beast.
Cheers driving me mad.
With the anthromopormophised homeware.
I'm not sure you spelled that right.
Neither am I.
Just one extra 'mo'.
I'm filling in my bs performance review ahead of the end of the year.
One of the questions asks if among other things I act with determination.
Well do you ?
I think there's an episode of gundam unicorn I missed.
BwaS one with bad cgi.
Went 3-1 on ladder with the jankiest of secret hunter decks to complete a class card quest.
Win streak including a golden paladin of all people.
Crushed by a murloc shaman =.
BwaS good job.
Casual has been a lot more casual lately with the introduction of the sillier dailies.
Turns out cloaked huntress and getting a christmas tree is pretty pleasant.
Oh yeah its important to note that the paladin secrets were always the worst.
Trees for mages and hunters are a lot more frustrating to break.
Resultant pack the unusual case of an epic card being a duplicate kodorider so that's an above-average dust count =P.
So blueballed. landed 91 xp away from a level up on OW.
Just play anothe rmatch!
MoonWolf btw ChaosSmurf put up the first part of our playthrough of Karazhan last week if you wanna see the new versions of Opera Maiden Moroes.
Huh smurf also uses x/zperl.
You get to see my transmog.
And also smurf calling a druid a hunter.
Also glimpses of Glenn's transmog but given he's a mage he doesn't show up in melee much.
Oh god now all the world can see my suboptimal gameplay.
Noelor ugh this UI is nearly painful to me.
GlennCuttlefish we're all transmogs now.
MoonWolf blame Smurf.
Say the thing.
That was a little funny.
When we died?
No the big bad wolf.
Getting him to say run away little girl.
We bothered him a few times I think.
Well attumen changed a lot.
We really deserved to wipe on attumen.
Like I was honestly a little surprised watching that video when we didn't.
There may have been a wipe that was completely off-camera in fact.
Hmm headline banner at blizzcon under warcraft still running with thrall.
Like air traffic control but with ghosts.
Not sure we actually wiped on attumen.
We died to the mobs before attumen I think.
Maybe it's just that I died then.
And I looked up some mechanics while I was dead.
Why hello there.
Wakfu 3 nox is fucking with us again.
Holy. just got an 870 pair of gloves. off a wq in suramar.
No matter how hard you try adamai you will never be as cool as your brother.
So like my arti's at 886/880 highest relic 860 then legiondary of 895 so yah ggwp titanforged.
It really is so nice having operational central heating.
You should tell anathema about it.
So glad I'm not the sort of fool who would set the timer on their thermostat without actually switching it on for a whole month.
Probably already been linked but whatever.
Mostly linking that for the annoyance factor 3c.
I got a few scenes into it earlier before shutting it down.
<< knowing precedent we'll be lucky to clip above 240p consistently. also who even has a monitor that big.
BwaS not me t hats for sure.
Can i pay for half a ticket for the 1080 stream instead ?
Yeah but they'd never og for that.
You only get half the bastion skin though.
I'll trade the half bastion skin for all of the hearthstone cardback.
Not a sufficient trade need to throw in 5 of your deck slots to count.
Did you see the webm?
Oh I looked at it again and it's not actually FFXIV.
But have it anyway.
Oh this is that terrible thing they are making.
I mean that phrase could describe literally anything in the world right now but.
Loving how I cant practice my genji when all the bots have instant perfect cancelling against deflect.
While I enjoy flip flappers I do think its gotten a bit lewd by episode 5.
It was flipping kemonomimi episode 2 what did you think.
Handholding AND blushing.
Flapping all the flips.
Wearing all the goggles.
Also I was going to go to bed but ended up browsing amazon's makeup section.
Found this kinda cute but utterly pointless product.
I have no words.
You know Glenn.
For when a sudden nail-painting emergency occurs.
Out in the world away from tables.
I started watching this series for colourful adventures.
And then this episode happened.
Why does the robot have a hermaphroditic eye?
My question exactly.
Also why are there creepy twins.
Also they're not that creepy.
Mid-rank creepy at most.
Thats just how they start.
Before you know it they are eating bodies or something.
Happy school adventures.
Their dresses aren't even gothic MoonWolf.
I think the robots eye identifies what its looking at/thinking.
Look the gender of the creepy twins is not important robot.
Its the fact they are creepy twins.
You'd think a robot in an anime would be more used to androgynous characters.
Also that it even understand gender at all.
I think its more that the robot is considering those two to be a single person.
This robot seems not smart.
I mean its not wrong. most creepy twins are practically a single character rather than two individuals.
In any case I've closed amazon without buying any emergency nail polish holder rings.
And am going to bed.
Good i don't think anyone needs those.
Y'all enjoy your creepy anime twins.
But are you sure you can do without it?
Yes people manage to go with chipped nail polish for a day all the time.
Another shot of the robot looking at other people.
Great its a robot capable of shipping.
Like all the best robots.
TIL suicide hasn't been illegal in the UK since the 60s.
Suicide being illegal is just dumb.
Well I see the community-endorsed unofficial blizzcon irc is as shitpost as ever.
Yeah thats bound to be as terrible as twitch chat.
Wondering if this movie will be hacked.
Probably and the host will have to be forced to act surprised.
Also want them to hurry up and reveal why they keep bringing up dice.
You know if that means a Warcraft TTRPG I'm just going to throw all my 13A Notes in the trash v.
If it's that it'll be Dungeons Diablos.
You're ahead of me.
But yes oooh!
Well I think we all can see where this is going.
I think they listened to Artosis' request from GSL.
Well I doubt his only.
I see Blizzard has been looking at EA sports trailers.
Thanks Blizzard for pointing out that 99 is the end of the username of a 17-year-old today.
Mike is so damn sincere.
Now that's an unfortunate last name.
Just had an ancestor in dairy?
But Heroes is still Nova and Zeratul on red team in every QM and they're still as frustrating as ever to play against.
Oooh it's Raggy.
The implication that Nexus is the Blizzard afterlife amuses me.
P much its canon explanation yeah.
It does explain why Jaina turned into a huge bitch P.
You will wipe the puny insects unless theyre mvp black.
A flexible warrior that can be tank or melee assassin yeah that's kinda artanis.
Damnit I just bought zarya and auriel in hots!
But I dont have carry-gan and greymane so I guess?
Milker and Chew. P.
In the blizzard afterlife a capricious force forces you to right your friends and enemies and people you don't even know.
Oh god. I am getting WC13A campaign ideas =D.
I shall carry you to Braxis Holdout all shiny and red team.
Cooked_Auto they're even setting up factions for you.
I know right.
Only problem this is post-Cata.
Heh Piranha gun.
Instant 100 dust.
BwaS but piranhas.
Dob has turned into a bitter card player who no longer believes in the heart of the cards.
I do believe in the heart of the cards.
He's called my golden ETC.
Good job chu 15 year old meme.
He was standing just in the right spot to obscure the health total from the camera.
Blizzcon has always been out of sync.
Thats just the cultist with a battlecry instead of a deathrattle.
But i'll take it.
Reverse dark cultist.
Oh right too slow.
Multiclass cards are a great idea.
Erm ethereal peddler value?
100 possible potions meaning you'll never get the one you want.
Noelor yeah but his condition synergises with reno for deckbuilding.
Reno's going out soon though no?
Expansion after this.
I'm all for this.
Diablo 3+1 = Rebuild of Evangelion 4 confirmed?
8 directions lol.
Oh no he did not just go there.
Make Sanctuary Great Again?
This better be the necromancer.
Or i will kill people.
The cow from the cow level.
Omg actually what BwaS said though for real.
Okay good it is.
Hey at least this one has a bone shield.
Still has a dumb scythe though.
Oh it's DLC.
Thats fine by me.
Ok but for real.
Why all the dice.
Wait what was it? /.
Actually 'overran' on the schedule listed for an hour.
Oh my and I thought the OW stage for opening week was cute.
I mean it's got nothing on the Dota2 International but looks very nice.
>subtitling English because you think the audience can't deal with that Swedish accent.
And of course they all get their cocks out for seagull.
Oh my word they are wearing the loudest shirts and socks on the starcraft.
Because it's important this game does well in China so we can't say Taiwan.
HotS representative competes under Taiwan.
Frodan is hamming it REALLY hard.
How entirely surprising.
Noelor he has a fake leoperd skin jacket.
Hey he just really likes fifth element okay.
You know 2 years ago this guy was known for being a good caster and mc pretty entertaining and very professional.
Not the guy that makes you wonder what ridiculous jacket he's wearing.
And how badly it'll clash with is haircolour.
They just nerfed moonglade portal.
Out of morbid curiosity I popped over to the loot shop.
Diablo Reaper of Souls Mahjong Set.
Because why not.
6 mana 1/1 battlecry spawn a 6/6.
BwaS what ?
New card reveal.
Must have missed that.
I was getting some quick groceries.
Oh come on.
Thats just making it easy on the cosplayers.
They also have/had a sort of tracer tracksuit jacket an aviator/bomber jacket.
Tbh you can get dva bodysuits for like $60 on ebay.
I'm just looking at the New for Blizzon section.
It had a hoody.
Also the leggings are not the hard part of Tracer cosplay.
You have to make her time gadget.
Saw that one.
I'd probably buy the basic one and dress him up from there.
I think they just put Flash Gitz in hearthstone.
Its a great name.
You're playing paladin so ofc truesilver champion is auto-include.
Secret paladin triggered.
OW esports does depress me when their spectators fly around and show you what the maps /can/ look like with a psycho battlestation.
Yeah I'm all sorts of about Sombra.
Its a bit chilly out there.
That would explain it.
2nd round on lijiang russia in control france come through and get a team kill but dont get anyone onto the point in time for overtime.
Why did you have to be butt fight anime.
GOddamn Murloc Ninjas.
Well then.
Whats wrong with butt fighting.
<- it was at that moment I realized my GM could not run a proper horror call of cthulhu game.
Meanwhile I'm debating if I shouldn't just run Shadowrun Warcraft set in Gadgetzan.
I'm not even sure how that would work.
But go for it.
Well Shadowrun-ish adventures set in the city is a start.
Varian warrior/assassin dual class so both daily quests progress at the same time.
Sombra can hack indificual enemies to disable their active abilities great spelling ben.
He is very tired and busy.
And his editor is probably on the way to bed.
But i still enjoy poking fun at him.
Also he is an editor.
Incidentally all her stuff's on the website now.
Playoverwatch that is.
Except gameplay footage.
Oh and her real name's hashed out.
It's totes Alejandra though.
In my headcanon this is how she actually makes friends.
Her requests will be to go shopping and have brunch on saturday.
I'm pretty sure she hacks herself into different coats incidentally.
I think thats just her coat being GITS style digital camo.
So she can just make it look like whatever.
On review it's just synced up with a stance change that totally alters how the collar lies.
Oh her origin's up on the website too.
I'll read it later.
Dark now on shutout match point against Neeb.
What happens if we put two 15 man teams in one of our 2-5 arenas - is it balanced? probably won't be.
No it really wont.
At least they are honest.
Welp Argus confirmed.
Sargeras' ankle must be struck at!
I mean it's been confirmed ever since a quest you do at like 102.
Ahn'qiraj remembrance day 22nd january anniversary of first date a server opened the gates. It broke all the servers continuously. So on that anniversary we're gonna bring the servers down.
That could also be coming in 7 1 5. and by could I mean is.
Am looking forward to hunters getting leokk as a mount and rhok'delar back.
Well so far the Heroes hasn't been interrupted by a 1hr timefill waiting on Na'Vi to figure out how to connect to the teamspeak server.
Pissed off with all these druids playing the tavern brawl like it's ladder with their boring cthun decks.
Holy shit they are finally adding a crafting material only bit to the diablo 3 inventory.
I can finally reclaim 4 rows of inventory space.
And and equipment/build swapper.
MoonWolf is there something like skygems for fo4?
Not that i'm aware.
Ok well what was that perks mod you mentioned a while ago? p.
Got any other recomendations>.
Armorsmith extended is great so is More Weaves and most of my other stuff is pretty unimportant.
Here is a list.
I am not playing a game that crashes frequently that only lets me save if there is a non owned sleeping item nearby.
I don't enjoy WALKING BACK TO THE FUCKING DUNGEON.
Everytime i die in said dungeon.
Or building or cave or whatever.
You know what i mean.
I don't think the perk mod plays well with my alternative start mod.
Whats going wrong ?
Lots of perks had a level requirement of 50 I started with 4 ranks in chemist I had two pip-boys in my inventory.
The second rank perks on the first row are supposed to be level requirement 50.
The rest not so much.
They're OP and you can only pick one of them and only at level 50.
There was quite a few that required a really high level before I even picked anything.
Ah well that sucks.
Aaah frodan got rid of his leopard jacket.
In exchange for a TIGER print jacket?
Observation of the evening auriel rather good in heroes aram.
Faceless summoner into mukla firelands into leeroy not bad rng.
The development team has recreated the events monsters and all 16 levels from the entire original game with ‘retro’ graphics filters‘90s-inspired audio eight-direction character movement and even a lower framerate of up to 25%. snrk.
Noelor> is your sky perpetually exploding tonight?
Hopefull it'll stop before you want to sleep.
Just pissing down here.
By which I mean a lot.
Light rain my ass v.
Its just light Cooked_Auto.
Don't be so dramatic about it.
Hah no it's pouring down outside.
Double eu v kr hots semis starting shortly.
Legendary OW skin... and it's for Bastion when I've just got the BlizzCon skin.
Is it the nice wooden one ?
Ok EU are at matchpoint in the first semi vs KR. this is very unexpected.
Ok one bit of EU hots is now better than one bit of particularly good KR hots.
Xcom 2 mission Operation Demi-Romantic Mary Sue.
Its a heavy burden being cool.
You are the second one Ive seen who has responded in pretty much the same way about that today amusingly enough.
Handsome like an F-22 jet fighter Haha.
They do look nice.
Well I wont deny that.
A new story is coming out soon not Blizzard soon which will showcase more of the LGBT side of Overwatch.
Jeff wants to remind everyone that the Church on Dorado is actually a Courthouse. He'd like his teammates to respond to his cries for help at the Courthouse to actually make their way over there.
A new story is coming out soon not Blizzard soon which will showcase more of the LGBT side of Overwatch. <- i mean why bother.
There is like 4 straigth pairings in all of the fanart.
To piss off the 95% of tumbler whose ships aren't the dev-selected canon?
Like that ever stopped anyone.
Watching the hearthstone challengestone vod. And I thought I was good at building intentionally bad decks.
MoonWolf why am I Tracer?
Kinda curious how direct a quote that LGBT thing is.
I'll be very pleasantly surprised if they actually have trans* characters/issues.
Also why does a not-church have pews Jeff? come on.
Courtrooms have public seating behind the participants.
MoonWolf> there is like 4 straigth pairings in all of the fanart <- MercyXReinhardy MercyXSoldier LúcioXD.Va ???
I remembered another while in the kitchen MercyXGenji.
Also I just realised I'm actually on top of Tracer which just confuses me.
Going to assume mods.
Wait where are you tracer is there scrollback I missed?
MoonWolf's XCOM game.
Which yes before you logged on.
Noelor you forgot symmetra/junkrat junkrat/mei.
SymmetraXJunkrat is disgusting.
But they do it anyway.
And JunkratXMei is like suuuuper one-sided.
Both those ships are like more conceptual than anything else.
Fire and ice order and chaos.
Doesn't stop people though.
Nah JunkratXMei one-sided is canon.
He likes her she thinks he's awful.
Noelor you are not tracer i have a mod that give me a second row behind the first row of soldiers.
For the equip screen.
You are behind tracer.
He likes her she thinks he's awful <- well this is just shipping relationships 101.
Hell its about half the romcoms i know.
Well most romcoms thinks he's awful means a bit of a dick.
In this case I think he's an actual mass-murderer?
I thought he was just a thief.
Not going to say he hasn't hurt or killed people.
But didn't think he was a captical M murderer.
He blows up an office building in the middle of the day in Going Legit.
I mean there's an argument that he's not of a sufficient mental state to realise that's murder but.
In terms of what Mei thinks of him not really material.
Oh i agree on the mei thing.
Junkrat in general really isn't relationship material.
Challengestone casters ripping on my favourite card in the game tentacles for arms =.
Its not a very good card dob.
I know but it has a special place in my heart having drawn it golden.
TIL widow's scope is the sound of a snake.
Ofcourse it is.
And genji was basically recorded by sticking a microphone down a cutlery drawer.
Welcome to the magical world of foley artists.
I see blizzard managed to get their voice actor guest to show up to their con unlike the 2 headliners for the one I went to last yr.
Yeah that guestlist was a mess.
Headline Goku's VA Actually Goku's Team FourStar VA.
Also some transphobic furry guy idr.
There was some weeb at the end of sunny this yr who mistook me for that fourstar guy.
Since yknow he's also a caucasian male with dark curly hair and wears glasses.
Culmination of OW sound panel there is a tiny guitar riff that goes down in high noon but we will not tell you the difference between the two bastion tank mode kazoos.
If I believed there was any real work to be done as a foley artist I would probably try training as one.
But that does seem like a niche that is easily filled with someone more competent.
Seems like you'd have the ears for it at least.
Mental note don't try and watch the OW WC vod's on one screen while actually playing the game on another.
That doesn't work for audio cues.
It's hiiiiigh- wait they have a mccree now?
Dr Strange is a good film.
So I picked up layton and unwound future again.
Fucking layton bullshit.
Puzzles puzzles everwhere.
Dreaming in puzzles.
If only these games were at least consistent with their bullshit.
But noo they just have to throw curveballs around every corner once you start thinking logically.
I swear half of the puzzles break their own logic.
= went on casual with a regular deck to avoid ladder stress doing dailies get matched against a rogue who I'm pretty sure was on an all class card quest deck.
Estimated VO2 max 50.8 very high yess I'm winning at health.
Except for those chronic pains.
At the VA panel they said that Mei's Sorry! line was actually a result of Zhang Yu her VA apologizing for her line readings. The devs loved it so much that they put it into the g.
Blizzcon half-invigorated me to get back on the hots tryharding but it wasnt long into my first HL game before the toxicity started =.
In fact it started with the draft when someone aborted a double warrior comp for a nova pick.
Because DD there is a monster in a recent product that has a psychic shroud preventing others from reading its thoughts.
This monster also has Int.
You can't read its thoughts.
But it barely has any.
Science victory sadly still takes forever and is a little unsatisfying because of it I say this playing on prince and having still not actually won said game.
Noelor is it building a rocket again ?
A series of them!
I have to first put a satellite in earth orbit then a mission on the moon.
Then a colony on mars not AC.
Also I went to bed but then had to get back up because I started thinking about tomorrow night's RPG session and realised my character is heavily Gina Torres' character in Firefly and that needed to be recorded for tomorrow me.
I'm here to play an RTS not Kerbal!
Its not real time.
TBS but yes.
Anyway bed again for real this time hopefully.
Grmbl didnt even have to get up at this ungodly hour in the end.
My dentist just cancelled on me.
Is it possible to make the bot show the amount of snow on ground moonwolf?
Sadly the weather service i use doe snot expose that.
Actual temperature -6c. according to the local forecast temperature feels like -13c.
Fun times going out today.
Cooked_Auto holy shit really?
GlennCuttlefish yeah the bloody wind sucks.
Walking to work was mildly unpleasant.
Omg what kind of person per-announces their kickstarter!?
I wanted to give them money now not in a week.
Anathema those who want to build up hype and excite people like you.
Well consider me hyped.
Anathema you would be.
Oh mirror's edge catalyst came out around the same time as Overwatch no-wonder I missed it.
Quality blizzard code.
Finished the match without any character models loading.
Did you win?
I hope he did BwaS.
Times like that i probably pick junk and go ham.
Win? ha ha no I usually cant get a win even if I see them these days.
This matchmaking is whack yo.
I'd watch that anime.
My zarya life in hots is an accurate parallel of my zarya life in OW zero energy for days.
At least my primary fire auto-attack connects though.
<- no boots or tiaras 7/10.
I'm watching a live stream of firefoxes on the firefox page on a firefox browser.
On humblebundle Pay $1 about £0.80 or more FeelsBrexitMan.
I love tihs dumb comic so much.
On a mythic run with 3 from a guild who thinks they're all playing Elder Tale.
<- owned by obama.
Noelor I need your help.
You must be truly desperate to come to me for help.
The year is early 2018 AD. WotOG has not yet rotated out of standard. Druids have yet to find a deck other than CThun to play on ladder.
A terrible druidtopian future.
Or I guess dystopian.
ChaosSmurf whatever for.
Noelor hoodie issues.
Holy fuck that vid of Sombra actually at Blizzcon though.
Zone into route 66.
Prepare to attack.
4 rein 1 76.
Well okay then.
I wear 2XL tees and they're fine but like your frame is apple-pear and mine's arguably banana.
And that hoodie is definitely aiming for hourglass.
I realised my hoodie was only XL incidentally because I went to superdry's site to see if I could find a size chart for comparison.
And their online chart only goes to L.
Update the 6 reinhardt did not quite escort the payload to first marker but dropping down to 2 reinhardt completed teh map.
ChaosSmurf ifdo you get it and it doesn't fit I'll buy it off you tbh.
What emoji is that hidden behind a lego brick on my client?
Noelor I probs will.
Finally finished the science game.
Its been snowing for a while here.
I think theres 10-25cm of snow on the ground now.
No snow here.
Well between choosing fucking up or fucking up in a slightly different manner I am not sure which fuck up I would have preferred..
For americans I do suspect this was the worse choice.
And now its snowing. Even if its +1 outside.
Wait what? v.
Fuckit time to boot up my computer. maybe i'll even finally install that new graphics card and remove the sound card since everything is starting to run terribly.
Bah Café changed its open hours from thursday to sunday and on top of it all my phone crapped out for some reason.
Is there a good reason Chrome decided to try and change the keyboard command for Back?
If anyone knows.
Cant remember if there is a keybinds tab or not.
Haven't checked but doubt it.
Chrome's not famously flexible.
Is it the one about the router?
Oh great youtube changed layout and broke my plugin again.
Just a broken page.
My windowed fullscreen one still works.
Trying another tv. for some reason I cant get this one to turn on.
The problem with insane hotel TV's is that I can't be sure if its even programmed to turn on witihout some attached doohickey or the proper remote.
Success! Poking it until the fault gave up worked again.
Minister nobody uses it it confuses people.
Next problem with this screen Colours are really muted. that however is not something I can fix without the remote.
Because lol locked settings.
Hm. lets see if I can fix this resolution problem.
!hs Pint-Size Potion.
Rolled arena instead of packs for shits and giggles.
Picked mage and already 4-0 on the run.
Updated PatternSpider to properly handle the new hearthead site also gadgetzan.
BwaS mages are kings of the arena.
Well until I can find a proper remote I guess I'm stuck with this weirdass resolution.
Anathema something people didn't use somehow confused them so they... changed it to definitely confuse those who *do* use it?
Sounds like google chrome logic alright.
Love seeing the potg replays from teammates when it's me on the feed getting the kb's.
That ninja is too meta for my taste -Someone playing Panic at the Dojo 2016.
Why are they genji?
No they deliberately fell off a lorry to avoid actual HP damage.
This is a thing you can do.
Please throw me onto the helicopter I don't know what I wanna do but I wanna be there -every vampire I've seen play Panic at the Dojo 2016.
So one of them.
How did your playtest go ?
Their vampire also got thrown onto the helicopter.
Hence every =P.
They did not take the nun.
And .'. died a lot.
But yeah it was fun.
People enjoyed it I plugged the kickstarter constantly like a good capitalist.
I'm not sure thats capitalism ?
Only downside was the final boss is suuuuper tough which is fair given y'know final boss and the only enemy in his encounter but we were up against the shop's closing time.
The players pulled off some cool tricks with traps and the revamped clumsy style to fuck him up though.
Traps are pretty harsh yeah.
Relatedly I'm in the process of setting up Karate Hotfoot in Roll20.
While watching it because inception.
Are you stealing the six feats under little turn tracker thing ?
Teehee drama llamas as a twitcher goes on a blog rant about the vote gets flamed in the comment section that they're divisive to their fanbase.
Meanwhile their partner voted third party and they had a blowout over wasted vote.
I hear the government in estonia has fallen.
Not seeing anything on the news about that.
Well they passed a vote of no confidence and the president resigned.
Cooked_Auto> the revolution will not be periscoped.
BwaS will it be facetimed?
Most likely tweeted or whatever is the new hip social media platform.
Not vine'd though.
And that should be all set up.
If I did it right players should see an arena containing a bunch of rubble two names guys some goons and on the right some weird laughter the initiative track and a bunch of faces.
I have no idea if/when I'll actually run it.
But there it is.
Yeah I know the feeling still on the fence when I'll run WC13A right now even if 2/3s of the party is done.
This is a 1-/2- shot so I can just run it some time everyone's around.
Just no point starting to rally for it until Mair gets back and I know what winter raiding's gonna look like.
Well didn't take long into the tavern brawl to find the standard legal cthun deck and the oh shit how do I build a deck hey you build one for me priest.
So I'm going through my profile on facebook seeing if anything's out of date.
Notice family ties are there check to see if that's up to date consider adding some extended family.
When I notice something on the family relationship menu.
Facebook that is not a family member that is a relationship status what are you doing?
Conforming to the bubbly californian demographic.
Ok but like spouse and partner hyponyms aren't there.
Anyway I added an adjective to my gender cloud because I could.
There's a gender cloud now?
Oh did I not bully you into doing this?
Click your name at the top of the page to go to your profile click About to go to your info.
About \ Contact and basic info \ Basic Information.
You can edit your gender which gives a drop-down of Male/Female/Custom.
If you pick custom you get to pick from a pre-generated list.
This includes actively identifying yourself as a cis male which imo you should 100% do! if you so identify.
And then you can pick a pronoun from the three that can be found in english dictionaries.
Well it's saying what I want it to so I'm satisfied.
Man the step up from low -> medium is pretty nice in overwatch.
Video settings.
Heh I can imagine as much.
Noticed similar watching streams/competitive. never knew the first arc of 66 has flame doodads or that the fountain in dorado has confetti around it.
I should clear up my temp folder more often.
Cleared 12GB just now.
Ccleaner works nicely for me.
Not my style D.
What the flying fuck is going on in this series.
It started as a prison gag anime now its going full kill la kill on me.
Even the sparkles are gone.
Hmm that one okay.
The fact that Sombra doesn't have Boop as a voiceline in-game yet is a travesty tbh.
Theyve said theyre gonna put it in.
Still waiting for Sombra gremlin.
Minister should have been in day 1.
2/10 worst character.
That voice line makes me irrationally angry.
It's a very rational anger don't sweat it.
Why you so mad?
Googling if I can dye my hair white...
Ah a wikihow result.
The answer as expected is no I'd have to re-bleach.
Til the card art for stormpike commando has a bear on it.
I will miss all mei eichenwalde defenses.
Where they goin?
Oh right 1 hero limit.
Not gonna do the no limits mode then?
I love me a good monocomp.
Lol had moment on ililol where me and other soldier dropped ulti at same time potg ended up being both of us spazzing wildly.
They are adding 1 hero limit to standard?
With 'arcade' expanding brawl to carry a 'no limit'.
I look forward to the give hanzo or feed drama.
Surely there are enough pointless deeps heroes for everyone on a team to be satisfied?
Yeah but they MAIN HANZO.
Signs you have played diablo 1 way to much.
There already is that drama.
I can see what you see not. Vision milky then eyes rot. When you turn they will be gone Whispering their hidden song. Then you see what cannot be Shadows move where light should be. Out of darkness out of mind Cast down into the Halls of the Blind.
You read that In The Voice.
Had the good old we need a healer *a very esportsy twitchy battletag* *career profile is exclusively dps*.
At least his name wasn't literally a twitch url.
I've seen two of those.
Standard response to that should be so swap to one.
My macro is be the change you want to see in the world.
My usual response is good of you to volunteer.
Sadly it never works.
Guess I need to find an even more passive agressive response!
Think the game needs a mode-specific queue option so I can spam koth exclusively. pretty sure my win rate is higher there.
We're all MoonWolves now.
Joke in another channel.
Oh right misread that.
I was explaining the name change not insulting anyone.
Yup yup I know.
MoonWolf hates fun.
We knew that though.
Plenty of frozen wet pavement and cobblestones.
So it doesnt feel like +3.
Also no rain.
Woo only -4 and not that much wind. I might actually venture outside long enough to have a smoke today.
Got to 7-0 in mage arena now at 7-1 off mage opponent summoning leeroy from the firelands.
And it's a herald volazj. rip.
BwaS seems you misspelled free epic of choice.
That's what you call all my legendary draws =.
I'm sure you have some good ones.
Really I assume Dutch?
That is indeed Dutch.
And a perfectly normal last name.
Oh Dishonored 2 tomorrow.
A future mount to come to the Nexus is the 'Special Snowflake'.
New card reveal of the night firelands portal nerf.
BwaS that is... a siht card.
5 mana gets 1 more points of stats over a vanilla 5 mana card but easier to trade into.
Stand slightly better against the darkness?
Bah the dva announcer for sc2 doesnt apply to single player.
Whats even the point then.
I dont know but it sure aint for motivation to get me through the last two legacy missions.
Flip flappers continues being AOTS with its 2deep4u shenanigans.
I dont know what demon of curiosity possessed me to google this but there truly is a mod for everything in skyrim.
Enough dust for a legendary but no clue which one to craft.
Sylvanas is p good?
Mm she is up there. with a good few others.
The Doctor if you like Wild.
He was my 2nd gvg pack legendary.
I think a cosplay minute the time it takes after a fictional character is revealsed for there to be cosplay of it might be shorter than a new york minute.
At least its longer than the rule 63 time.
63 is the genderbendin gone.
63 is the gender swapping one.
But then again she could been a blizzard employee since you had people doing OW costumes at the same Blizzcon the game to announced.
Don't bring your facts to this table C_A.
Not to mention we've kind of known her general apperance for a while now thanks to that leak.
Megalovania started playing so that'll be what's on for the rest of lunch I suppose.
How much longer is lunch ?
I should re-play Undertale before the year's out.
Really wish i was in the Gwent beta.
It seem pretty good on streams.
Colleague's Excel had managed to reach >1GB of memory.
Wow skype desktop hasn't updated itself for almost an hour now I notice when I come back home =|.
Oh neat DD got inducted to the National Toy Hall of Fame yesterday.
Should have done that at launch though blizzard.
It's amazing how many bad decisions Blizzard make after so many years.
Like not including boop as a voiceline.
Or a tag.
Maybe it is a tag?
They are makin git a voiceline.
It should be both.
There is a boop spray tag from like the halloween set where it's boo! with a P sprayed on top.
Had a great death knigget example in timewalkers today which felt like a massive throwback to wrath days.
Levelling in cloth heirlooms calling me out for using barrage as it's bad dps and claiming it's inefficient at 60 focus.
<- there is no god. there is no justice. there is no just God.
Zarya knows why she's here nsfwish.
Is Mair back yet.
I... don't know what that means.
That was refering to diablo 3 patch notes i believe.
Aaaah house is as bad as Ana's cambridge flat used to be aaaaaa.
Three weeks devoid of heating will do that.
MairBear you should come raid with us.
It's going swimmingly =V.
What a shame that my everything is needing updates.
MairBear welcome back.
MairBear dyk I'm vegetarian now?
Noelor I did not!
I had that thought like the day after you left.
You've been vegetarian now for like over half a year.
What was the thought/reason?
Also Noelor IDK what you saw on offer at pokemon store but I couldn't find anything you got however there were among other things pikachu in Evil Team outfits. So I got a Team Flare'chu.
And just other stuff in general.
MairBear yeah they rotate their stock pretty hard.
Which one were you at? there's like a dozen now I think.
I went to the ones in Kyoto Osaka and the 'Mega' one in Ikebukuro.
MairBear takes pokemon shopping seriously.
I had 3 weeks xD.
I'm off to see broelor in Feb.
The Kyoto one was doing a one of a kind only in this store Maiko-outfit Pikachu...
Pokeball pattern parasol ho-oh print kimono. Too adorbs.
Might have to divert to Kyoto >.>.
Should have gotten one for noelor it sounds like.
Also I struggled to find shops for me a thousand model and figurine shops with baffling price ranges eg a 6 inch statue of a character 4000 yen an 8 inch with slightly more detail 14000.
Inch costs are exponential.
Thats why giant robots are so expensive.
But I struggled to find anything like shirts and stuff even for myself let alone for gifting C.
Til MairBear was gone from irc let alone that he was in glorious nihon.
Only got a White Mage themed FFXIV t-shirt for nerdgoods apparel.
But I did also go to the FFXIV cafe which was much better than hoped.
Basically I spent too much time in Nikko and the country and nowhere near enough time in Kyoto or Tokyo c Lessons for if I ever afford another trip.
Plus apparently Kill la Kill is old news now so no Nui figurines to be seen just Satsuki Ryuuko a single Mako one. c.
I'm sorry =.
Also you value harime nui you're literally the worst.
MairBear omg Nikko is soooo pretty rn though.
Amazing leaves yes but the two gates I knew most about are covered for renovation xD.
Overall it was great in Nikko itself we sort of booked into a slightly off the track place and spent a couple of days aimlessly wondering however it was all in all exhausting to the legs and fantastic to the brain.
Nikko Nikko Niii~~?
Plus we took a day-trip up to see the fox village.
Oh they stopped being total butts about Sombra I see.
Yeah sombrero is on the ptr.
Hots vs ai only on adept mode and the bots for most of the game got to like a 3 lvl lead had first keep all objective captures and ended up bot mvp.
With one player dying 12 times. Like it was quickmatch.
MoonWolf May or may not be handy for OTS.
Really wish I could excl.
Exclude shares from rightmobe.
Bum no skse for the special edition yet so no skyui.
Ah damn. So one would have to go through the regular mod-installing stages while also finding out which ones can run without SKSE? D.
Or was it just the big ones like SKYUI that needed it?
MairBear the nexus has a seperate section for EE mods but I think most non-SKSE ones should work.
Oh cool cool!
>windowmaker torb symmetry on Anubis attack.
Reaper and mccree too.
Oh hey its some kind of mair.
Which kind ?
Evidence inconclusive we must study its habits.
Whenever i play roadhog he always manages to be at 0 ammo any time his hook lands and spends the window of opportunity reloading.
Same with lucy always wants to reload every time I need a knockback.
Ah gotta love the splitpushing overextending sylvanas on their master skin in solo q criticising others for dying with fewer deaths than them.
Oh hey desert is bussing again.
Desert bus marathon.
Apparantly this a real mineral and not an ancient evil artifact.
Higher in hero league this season than I am in OW competitive. nice.
MoonWolf I disagree.
Noelor well you're disagreeing with science.
Oh nice the proper trailer is out.
Oh man they kept Batous eyes.
Didn't expect that.
Not sure about this who am i subplot.
Being so very literal.
Or plot even.
No idea if it'll have the puppetmaster plot or not.
At least they have the water fight which is rad.
Looks like they have roughly the first 20 minutes of GITS covered pretty literally.
Actually saw the first movie as a whole this week. I think I prefer the tv-series.
The movie works visually but the plot is kind of a snoozer.
Thats because the movie really was just an excuse to put the world on a screen.
If that makes sense.
It does yes.
Well if nothing else this will be a visually amazing movie.
Gotta love matchmaking queuing me against an archaic netdecked mill rogue on wild casual when I just wanna run a lowest curve play X class cards quest.
Fuck that prick.
Bet he thinks he's legend tier.
MoonWolf you been playing Tyranny?
So that's what Black Rook Hold is like when your group actually can do the stairwell.
ChaosSmurf no don't have it yet.
Not really feeling its being evil thing.
Gotta love matchmaking queuing me against an archaic netdecked mill rogue on wild casual when I just wanna run a lowest curve play X class cards quest <- but that'd be great against a mill deck.
You can just keep playing cars.
And they keep giving you more.
There's only so many vanished stepped coldlight oracles you can take.
And smorcing with a cutpurse through a deathlord sludge belcher wall doesnt happen.
Also vanish step healbot.
MoonWolf it's really good.
Probably buy it during a sale then.
Also don't you have infinity engine combat ?
Well I actually know how to play now.
It's still a bit.
Well it is real time with pause.
Its in the name.
You should see how i play dragon age.
You'd probably hate it.
I played dragon age by pausing at the start and then dropping the same 8 massive AoEs on top of everything.
While Shale danced in the middle.
I play dragon age with the AI off or as off as you can make it.
This also has AI that I've turned off.
Never uses abilities right anyway.
PoE 2 should be really good.
Does POE have the spell creation system that's in this?
That's my favourite part so far.
Poe is much more dnd ish.
Druids and clerics just know all the relevant spells for their level.
And mages need to learn spells from levelups or the spellbooks of other mages.
ChaosSmurf how are the combo attacks working out for you?
They're mad OP.
But mean your main character doesn't really get a personality I think.
You just kinda want them doing a bit of everything so they can run around.
Not having them between party members seems like a mistep.
They do have combos together.
You have combos together.
!note Noelor.
You did it.
But just a single one.
I can't just go handing them out in this economy.
Hey MoonWolf hey hey MoonWolf.
So FFXIV did a hard mode of The Great Gubal Library.
The unlock quest name Let Me Gubal That For You.
Meanwhile in CiVI some people are so mad at me for being at war that they will demand gifts from me as trades then refuse to accept them.
Total war often gives you the diplomacy ultimatum of demand please do not attack with the condition accept or we will attack.
MoonWolf makes a lot of sense though it doesn't account for level ups.
Probably just add a per-tier bonus though.
Did anyone post the gits trailer already?
Jus checkin p.
Well my shaman is a jammy bastard. Freshly dinged first emissary box legendary chest piece.
1 niiiiice 2 yes the jammiest.
Hmm enh. am ambivalent.
MairBear basically made of preserved fruit yes.
MoonWolf thoughts on this pair of tweets?
Noelor well the eadra are basically inert and the deadra are insane.
So you know.
Lots of room for interpreation for both sides there.
Sailor Moon we've given up on naming things now we just put letters in caps after the title.
Gotta love the matchmaking protocol of leaving game finding more balanced game aka blue team won.
Apply that to the round before that on dorado vs all 6 of the SK world cup team please.
YEP can confirm leaving game to find more balanced one is indeed here's a win for red team to restore cosmic order.
Balance in ALL THINGS.
But only for red team.
Where's the matchmaker that doesn't throw a hissy fit over someone leaving the instant the defeat screen pops and gives them a 3 min requeue.
Noelor there was a splatoon soundtrack for sale while I was there too. Named Splatunes.
<- still love that music.
I should complete PoE so I can buy Tyranny without guilt.
Always shivers with that music ^.
Anathema yes thats how that works.
Do you ever finish painting your plastic mens before you buy more plastic mens ?
I have not bought plastic /men/ since March.
I bought tanks.
It was a great deal on ebay.
How many is lots ?
Oh also I have not 2 men but they weren't plastic p.
Tiny plastic/resin/metal men then.
That's a great typo.
Did GW ever have a Bakelite phase ?
Too brittle for small figures assume also before their time.
Hero bases!
That is some pro cosplay.
Unsure if actual amputee or hiding leg behind body.
Of course the morning I decide to actualy start working on drawing practise again my wrist dies more than normal.
Plan B Read up on theory.
Actually game this week.
We have a mair again.
I'll be rolling dice to choose my.
Like Panic at the Dojo!
Taking of those two things.
Minister its not going to make the vote stretch goal.
This makes me sad.
Because that means we won 't have tons more content.
I know =<.
So wonderful Skype has been shitting itself all day. Again.
Well its skype.
Sure but having it never actually stay online is incredibly annoying.
Makes it kind of hard to follow along discussions with people.
Did you miss an important update ?
Its their servers.
Acknowledged issue but its been like this for the entire day.
Fuuuck you microsoft.
Hilariously enough the Android client works fine while my desktop one has issues staying connected and keeping updated v.
Start using an andriod emulator >.>.
Nah Ive got my tablet.
So far its taken Skype 8 minutes to try to send one message v.
!hs Tanaris Hogchopper.
Damn not added yet.
Hmm a trio of quillboar biker mice from mars.
I just don't know anymore.
BwaS Biker Boar from Tanaris.
Doens't quite have the same ring to it.
Legendary skin drop that may or may not have been the one I was probs gonna buy in about 50 credits time. I call that a win.
I need a new graphics card to properly enjoy new skyrim I think.
Here's something to brighten your day Just one week away until an all-new #StevenUniverse episode! !!!
Posted last week.
Relatedly in that I'm scrolling down FB after avoiding it for a week FB has its priorities sorted.
Right since my arm continues being annoyingly busted tonight time to finally reinstall and possibly finish steins gate.
Damn there wasn't any Steins gate merchandise for sale. Just realised c.
Neither Steins nor gates?
I dont really see the mr symimetra.
1755 and I'm at 4/12 capitals.
Need to step up my game especially given I just checked and I don't even know who the 12th civ is.
Well 2 of the 5 options are immigrants from another mythos but we'll casually ignore that because emojis amirite.
Glad they got that sorted out.
Doesn't quite look bumbeling enough.
Ate meat once may as well give up the vegetarianism.
>session closed or no session exeption.
>inspect session IsOpen = true.
Its open for connections!
It wants connections but doens't have any.
Getting real fed up of people walking up to me and asking a question on something in the code I've not looked at for months and expecting an answer.
What you don't keep the whole codebase in your head at all times ?
Ffffffffff I forgot today for bowling night out.
This book needs a better skipping function.
I mean I could have caught up yesterday if I hadn't instead opted to play flash games until 3am but.
Maybe you can skip faster manually ?
I could but the whole reason I started this instead of playing other things is that my wrist is hurting enough as is.
I do give it props for stopping the autoscroll whenever you get a text message.
Widowmaker the only competent one.
I lost an earring.
From your ear ?
One of the studs found the back in my house so it could be anywhere from there to work.
Well at least it was only a stud.
Unless its hiding near your desk or in your house that thing is gone forever.
I don't have any spares though now I am asymmetrical.
Embrace your assymatry go full Bajoran.
This is the best thing.
What am I looking at here?
Look at how he plays.
Dual joysticks is at least a sensible if not good control scheme.
So just at the unconventional control scheme.
Its basically console controls but joysticks.
GlennCuttlefish he's playing s ymmetra WITH A MICROWAVE.
Well now I am just doubly confused.
Well healer DC'd at the start of a dungeon.
So everyone puts on a maid outfit and does a power-ranger pose.
Who needs healers anyway.
|Aww the tank stopped.
Curse this game it drives me to drink a whole lot of instant coffee.
The worst kind of coffee.
Yeah but the important thing is its instant.
And cheaper than those capsules.
Anyhow I think I've had somewhere between 2.5 and 3l of coffee today. Just the best kind of mood for visual novels.
!note Noelor.
Just think how weird that must feel for the draenei.
Hero Gallery > Sombrero > 0/58.
Long may it stay that way.
3v3 verdict. Gives you a map smaller than Nagrand Arena. Your other two teammates still never manage to find the fight.
OW devs decided 3v3 arena would be much more balanced by inclusion of rezzes.
The Sombreros are all stuck playing the PvE minigame of hack the medipacks rather than actually playing the game.
Gonna love this Eternal September.
Oh yeah sombra's out. guess I'll do a quick match or two to get my daily victory before bed.
Jesus christ I am terrible at 1v1 in this game.
Getting too old for this shit.
Today I saw another one of Blizzard's 404 pages v.
Disappointed BwaS didn't go for Eternal Septombra.
Yep definitely playing FF again.
Needs must be playing FF.
To paraphrase glenn I Play This Game For The Relevant And Modern Scripting.
Pretty sure you play it for the potato cosplay.
And the music. And the boss fights. And the moogles.
Definitely not the moogles.
Oh cool. Apartments.
That's a thing!?
Boo apartments are the same as buying a room in an FC >C Not gonna go and waste 500k gil on a second tiny room.
But what about aquariums ?
I think you can still install them in the FC room no?
I don't know.
It's the age of the aquarium~.
MairBear what fresh hell is ↓?
So you can you know.
Protect your hooves from demons.
Noelor Mages get spec-dependant barriers!
Or will soon PTR stuff.
I hope they both still protect from spellcasting delay.
Also GlennCuttlefish ChaosSmurf and Noelor.
Otherwise that's bs.
MoonWolf there are these neutral seagull mobs in one dungeon that are stupidly easy to add-pull by mistake and incapacitate players so if it's the tank everything in your current pull murders the healer.
Not a good time.
Do you see what seagulls do?
I'm getting the idea that every class change coming on PTR is unpopular. So people are either left alone or nerfed.
Noelor i thought seaguls mostly played genji in overwatch.
Aren't ranged hunters due to get traps back?
That seems positive.
Did say that at blizzcon yeah.
We stripped out everything in the name of class identity then we realised the class identity was the fuselage and not just the seats and trolley service.
With a line that SV can be the best at traps but others can have them back.
If the stuff on PTR is not changed I'm quitting come 7.1.5.
Which bit's got you?
Cooking question I'm doing a random stew to use up some frozen chicken so I intend to cook it for a couple of hours does it particularly matter when I add the other ingredients?
Always start with things like onions and garlic.
Bwas oh where to start.
Add your veggies depending on how firm you want them.
Well I'm including a swede.
Any herbs pretty early too like once it's on the boil to let them actually flavour it.
Nerfing RoP from 50% damage increase to 40% fireblast getting one charge removed flame on now grants an extra stack of fireblast instead of being 2 stacks instantly with a 45sec CD.
Combustion now converting 50% of my crit rating into mastery down from 100%.
And they are apparently removing ice floes from fire.
Also the seagull is allegedly called Gull'dan.
I hear he plays a sick genji.
Best patch note?
I don't do feasts.
Grammar changes great.
The temp tabard from the anniversary celebration package goes great with my tmog <3.
I forgot how patch notes work.
However *waves hands with descriptivist linguistic tendencies*.
A good point.
MoonWolf why is there an evil lili in the newest hearthstone trailer?
Never struck me as the crime lord type.
Then again medivh never struck me as a boogie man till recently.
GlennCuttlefish your roll20 mic is active.
Best part i'm set to receive nothing too.
Still getting it anyway.
Need a drink first.
MairBear> she turned to a life of crime to sustain herself after seeing barely any picks in hero league.
Look right she's got a stable job as one of my monk's top champions.
As in regularly out there?
Or stuck in the stable?
Regularly out there.
But I appreciate your word play.
Be there in a sec.
Fyi if any of you genji mains need some nexus challenge games over the next whatever give us a buzz.
Because she's a garbage lizard.
BwaS I'm up for playing HotS with someone for the sake of it.
Plus all the lovely heroes for that 30 game mark.
Cool I'll switch over.
Just a minute or two cos our game is winding down but it's post-game chatter.
Oh dear.
And that's for the maker of toiletpaper too.
Is it too much to hope that will get a price reduction during Black Friday? =p.
Tis blizzard so yes.
Damn it >_>.
But here a present.
Noelor is around? Noelor is wanting to be a 5th for karta?
Who's the 4?
Me smurf mair baylei.
Japanese tradition and all that.
Pro my throat is quickly getting better con voice is no longer deeper and sexier.
Take up smoking.
Nothing will ever give me Elias Toufexis' voice.
Such is life.
Urgh why can't I get this grep regexp to work.
And then Kat was a final fantasy final boss.
Nah didn't spell it aether.
I wish there was something like airbnb that wasn't exploitive.
Did they really get rid of HMs from pokemon!?
Took long enough.
Now just make a good shell windows MS.
Phow different is that from command prompt in basic troubleshooting?
Probably not much.
Oh let's see what the Heroes brawl is for the week.
Oh it's a 5 stack premade on red team.
And 3 of the 5 all went Illidan.
MairBear BwaS.
But since its a battlecry.
Coldara drake + finley to get a damage hero power.
Now we just need a way to reliably get coldara drake into priest.
Maybe compromise with garrison commander?
But i wanted infinite.
Okay that's that farce done for the week. worse than the sgt hammer one eesh.
Yay the issue I reported for VS2017 was triaged to 'new'.
Right one more ending remaining in steins gate. Sadly I will have to replay most of the game for that one.
Arena skirmishes bonus event where the only wins we'll let you have are ones where 1 or more of red team doesn't show up!
The first episode of the Grand Tour is pretty damn good.
The national blood service website is coded to force a match of gender and title when registering.
I'm as impressed as I am annoted.
I apreciate their attention to identity as it pertains to well blood and thus the health of everyone in involved.
But understand your annoynace nonetheless.
I want it to say sex instead of gender because yes I appreciate their need to know what bits are in my blood.
And not force a match.
Unrelated the pokémon anime has afaict significantly changed its art style for the new season.
Guess they felt after decades it was time to actually give it a facelift.
I should buy some souvenirs says Ash's mum as she passes a fruit stall.
Translation thing ?
Doubt it from what broelor's told me souvenirs are p important in japanese culture.
I'd expect just a kids' anime not dwelling on how far apart Not-Hawai'i and Not-Japan are.
That's fair enough.
Possibly also a thintg.
The backgroudn artist was told to make a market scene to pan over.
Didn't know / wasn't informed souvenirs would feature in the dialogue.
Nah they proceed to talk about how fresh the fruit is.
Well it was a good Theory.
Professor Oak's Alolan Cousin makes pokémon puns.
These are basically impossible to translate because they both are in japanese and use the japanese names for pokémon.
My pokémon has two types says a character as though that's at all impressive.
Is it a rookie trainer ?
No this guy is a senpai type I think.
Ok he's now using a Z-move so yes.
Great dialogue pokemon anime.
The framing plot for this series is Ash goes to Alola on holiday then decides to just stay there because there are pokémon to catch.
I thought this anime was about him going to school because he's skived off the last 2 decades?
He's going to school because it has pokémon in it.
Also people he's decided are his friends having met them the same day.
Just like freshers week.
I guess there was little they could do to top the ending of last series with him getting to first base.
Thas' just confusing imo.
Lol won mystery duel first time out.
1st round genji 2nd round widow opponent left after poss a minute of presumably us both camping a different side of the map.
Omg this episode of SU.
Til sound barrier doesnt block the dmg of selfdestruct S.
Sound Barrier is just extra shield hp iirc.
And SD does a looooot of dmg.
Mm I know both of those parts.
Like it blocks dragonblade and probably -strike being 1 hit KO.
Personal highlight clip with junkrat. starts mid rip tyre where I failed to find anyone then I wander up a corridor and double kill tracker sombrero facing opposite direction xD.
Huh OW is actually getting a price cut.
Career best damage done Mercy erm.
You're v good at mercy.
Clearly the best.
Oh Noelor before I forget again.
Right there its done I can now forever forget about gelbananas.
When I passed through the Osaka poke-center there were 4 fellows dressed as team magma and one guy with a slick haired A+ cosplay of Maxie. I mean employees rather than enthusiastic cosplayers. But it was a rad.
I just remeber him standing there imposing holding his glasses and nodding while one of the gruntemployees did all the talking to a small gathering.
GlennCuttlefish why do I doubt you'll forget them.
Why's Glenn been playing FF8?
Cos he went back in time.
The same reason I want to kind of play D3? boredom.
I never played FF 8 even in the past.
Then both my and Mair's jokes are unfortunately wasted on you I suppose.
Oh wow TPP already got a copy of SuMo.
Anathema.
132 minutes of LP videos to watch across three videos v.
And once again Jade gets fucked over by the Avatar project.
That is the job of the avatar project.
Yeah but he got like 2 at the same time or somesuch again.
Cooked_Auto what is your third after AW and XCOM?
Ratchet and Clank.
Ah good shout.
I have those + Lightning Returns.
Sitting in my pending tabs.
Well that was certainly a QTE prompt.
Yay Panic got funded!
MoonWolf ah rage-orc binge.
3 weeks without youtube gives one backlog etc but that was a fun 30 mins or so.
You missed some actual good brawls.
This page is giving me an aneurysm. well played pokemon.
I capture Kyoto and the game crashed.
Fuckin' Japanese hackers.
Hasn't the game had a patch yet ?
It actually has!
It included the additon of a couple of GUI things that were bizarre in their absence.
Namely that I've noticed recommendation icons on the research trees and an indication of upcoming border expansion via culture.
That last one is rather important.
So I got the HS q play 10 8+ minions. So it's astral druid minus well astral nourish aspirant.
And uh got a win at rank 20 +1* from a raven idolised astral D.
Beeb sortof seems to agree.
That disc of tzeentch sorc is pretty fun.
Interesting looking thing.
Noelor Might as well add an Uncharted 4 update to your backlog P.
HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO STAND ON THE GIANT ASS THING.
MairBear ths is the worst glitch.
Can't believe they don't fix it.
But if I stand on the giant ass thing it elevates my position in the middle of major sight lines and I just get sniped!
I am impressed at the range of animals of the broken isles chefs manage to make bacon from.
Technically all you need is belly fat.
But if I stand on the giant ass thing it elevates my position in the middle of major sight lines and I just get sniped! <- play Rein be a double credit to the team!
But I played rein last game!
Did not see amethyst voice actor like that.
How do I sound on vine again? C.
Click the microphone in the top left of the vine.
Keeps vanishing when I hover there >C.
I found it on the YT link though.
It was glorious.
Well crap. suddenly I ran out of things to do after finishing steins gate on my list. it was my eternal backup plan.
I clearly need a new game to procrastinate on.
Nah. I can take only so much of serious VN's.
Maybe I'll do the remaining routes of galgun next.
Sure is fun hosting a mythic plus run and the loot drop for you isn't an upgrade =S.
Ah yes and now a friend reminded me that this exists.
Not only is there nothing you can do with a snook except cock it... Linguistics textbooks are great.
It is incorrect as wlel.
But this is a chapter about idiom so.
Then I go online to do some exercises and have to look at George W Bush's infamous use of affixes.
So now my brain can't work out what are and aren't words any more.
Brains and words are annoying that way.
Ugh this exercise is pretending the Great Vowel Shift isn't a thing because it can't guarantee I know about it because it hasn't come up in the textbook yet.
And then I failed a phonology question because of my accent which I think signals a lunch break.
Your accent isn't even that unusual.
My accent is lazy.
It was a /ə/ vs /i/ thing.
BwaS I understand your LRT approximately 0%.
Newcastle are playing away to Leeds today.
Pretty sell-out crowd which Leeds havent been getting lately.
Like first time they've met in the league for ten years or something and it's a fairly charged occasion for both teams as it's anniversary of the passing of a mutual former player.
TIL there's a touhou in which the moon gets replaced with a fake moon.
Aptly titled Imperishable Night.
Some Touhou game have great titles.
Actually thinking about it all the .5 games are the ones that have amazing names.
Like Immatrial and Missing Power and Scarlet Weather Rhapsody.
I mean that last one could just be a Mars charm or something.
You should tell Vance that.
He'd probably do it.
I have not been in contact with anyone close to the writing team for years.
I just meant y'know.
Also TIL in one continuity Sonic had siblings called Manic and Sonia.
But what animal was Manic.
This is important for Sonic Characters.
Because they were siblings.
I am not going to take siblings as indication of what animals anything is in sonic.
Idk about you but my sibling is the same species as me.
Well yes but we don't live in a world with talking hedgehogs that absorb rings while going really fast.
I mean sure.
I just realized i have one photo/video on my twitter listing and its Reach Heaven Through Violence.
It fits both my like of morrowind and my like of k6bd!
Got into the Gwent beta.
Learning about verb tenses and wouldn't you know it English is a mess.
We use the progressive aspect ie describing something ongoing to describe the future tense because it is still being planned???
Ie I'm working tomorrow.
MoonWolf was it you who linked me that less/fewer datamined patch change from WoW?
Knew it was an M.
Then suddenly I'm reading a primary school child's essay about a fat lazy squirrel who dies because he didn't prepare for winter.
Damn lazy squirrels.
The death scene A hungry and cold Ernest flopped to the ground and never got up.
But it's okay cos it's a grey squirrel so we don't need to give a toss.
The squirrel's mum was sad.
The interpretation of two ambiguous sentences is affected by your knowledge that bathrobes do not usually have windows and an attic is not a piece of clothing.
Now who's being prescriptive?
<- TDO is involved.
Slightly surprised to see him working on something PbtA.
Any good games come out lately that a toaster can run?
Or maybe I'll just find a wild arms 3 image and finally play that.
Omg this game uses quark types for its stats.
On one hand this is making me feel old.
On the other hand I love we are living in an age where I can just google PS2 game roms and download them.
....what? Theres a whispered world sequel? HOW?
Ok I just got sniped through the hanamura bell.
Ahhh the ol' toblerone potg where they die in the first microsecond of the clip.
I'm watching The Genius.
I think one person is wearing a jumper that says Fucking Pumpkin.
They just hate pumpkin.
I can understand that.
Sounds lik a real peach.
MoonWolf anathema.
And now I find myself browsing Torchlight 2 mods. Or browsed.
Long shot given the time but anyone for HotS?
Yeh I'm game mair.
Gimme a few mins.
!note Noelor.
<- understanding korean 100% optional.
!note MairBear <- understanding korea.
Oh man they added all the other people who are actually now in my team in the org into my outlook team.
Must be a slow morning.
I'm too tired for work today.
Accidentally bought a lip piercing for my ear.
So I lost one of my silver studs the ones I got with the actual piercing so I thought I'd swap for ome gold ones but bought them waaay too thick but I also bought 2 thinnish segmented rings.
Could not get the gold ones in the hole I bought them for at all but did managed to get one hoop in so I've gone full asymmetrical with 2 hoops in one ear and 2 studs in the other.
And the colours don't even match.
Still say you should embrace the assymatry and go full bajoran.
I don't get that reference.
Its a startrek thing.
The bajorans have a racial/cultural thing with elaborate earring designs on one ear.
I looked at earrings on etsy once there are some amazing designs there.
Usually multiple pierced points connected by chains.
I want to get a piercing the cartilidge area but I'm a a coward b it takes ages to heal and I do obstacle races.
B is the real reason.
Yeah obstacle races and infections.
Is a pretty good reason.
Obviously lip piercings are out of the question they'd be hidden by my beard.
Huh the radiologist wants me to get another MRI but this time with a fluid injection to improve the contrast.
Sounds like you should do that.
I will be should probably make sure it will be covered by my insurance tonight.
Average cost for an MRI are Spire is £400 so yeah. Hope that is covered too o_0.
Damn didn't think it'd be that much.
Wound up reading the Wikipedia sub-article on Finnish phonology.
I think I understand maybe half of it.
Waiting for benchmarks to be done legit reason for slacking off?
Sure need to keep track of your benchmarks to make sur enothing is going wrong!
I mean if literally all the work you could be doing can only be done on one computer sure.
I'm doing something dumb in xcom2.
I installed 2 overhauls worth of additional classes.
And then fed all those perks into a perk roulette mod.
And making everyone have All their perks be on roulette.
Filtered by the primary and secondary weapon type they can equip.
Minister is now a Witcher character.
They love using ploughing instead of fucking.
Thought you meant in XCOM.
I don't know if i have you on my roster yet.
I made a test game with tons of additional starting rookies and a mod that makes them all level up to level 1.
And i'm going through them all to see if there is anything wonky.
Was more concerned about Witcher being added as an xcom class.
I could make that work sword + gremlin.
There are animations for not holding a gun.
Wouldn't look quite right though.
Sorry looks like you didn't make it on this time.
Tracer coming in strong with sniper rifle + psionics.
There is a Vive or Oculus or something being demo'd downstairs.
Oh good this is on vita too so I don't need to buy a PS4.
The PS Vita-al Novel.
Customers who bought this game also bought.
Valkyrie Drive is an intense brawler set in a universe where girls turn into giant super-weapons when sexually aroused. o_0.
Anathema it also has an anime!
GlennCuttlefish help me. I think my phone's haunted again.
Understanding korean not required.
Because i am bad as pasting text.
My retort.
You thing is the more astounding.
Lemme just finish this xcom mission first.
I picked up said hello got silence said hello and then a robot voice says goodbye.
I think it's gaining sentience and malice toward me.
Gaining malice towards MairBear is the natural outcome of gaining sentience.
MairBear do you wish to know about my current dumb xcom 2 idea ?
I have installed the long war perk pack.
And a second class/perk overhaul.
And then i shoved all those perks into a perk roulette mod.
Oh boy oh boy xD.
That makes it so everyone always rolls a Roulette class of random main weapon and random secondary weapon.
And assingns perks based on that.
While its perferctly capable of making sure you don't get sniper perks for shotguns.
It doens't really believe in apropriate ranks for perks.
So you can just get double tap for your cannon as a rank 2 perk.
Is that unusual?
Double tap lets you shoot twice only the second shot has a -15 aim penalty its one of the highest rank sniper perks.
How many perk ranks are there?
Right i made some tweaks and removed the somewhat ridiculous weapon combinations.
No sniper rifle + grenade launcher sniper rifle + sword cannon + grenade launcher cannon + sword.
I mean cannon + grenade launcher is normal.
But i don't like the combination.
Feels to overemphasized on special.
MairBear I'm sure Rowlett's got this.
It has leaves.
Yeah that'll help.
MoonWolf this vid about understanding Korea is p great.
I think the Priest is spamming Well Played.
But i'm not sure.
I would also enjoy The Light shall burn you.
But thats probably not it.
I think korean is roughly as verbose as western languages ?
And its two words.
Or one word.
So eh probably not Threaten.
All I know about Korean is Hangul.
MairBear so the jade lotus cards look neat.
Much more fun than the grimy goons.
SPACE HULK SPACE HULK SPACE HULK.
No sir I dont like it.
What if we do this to it.
Its not really helping.
Well now is it not only a crime against design its also a crime against fashion.
Playing exalted just got 14 successes on a martial arts roll.
Specifically Cha + MA to determin my place when participating in a tournament.
A really good one then?
Not victor because I only practice a single style but pretty good and a fan favourite.
Also some shady sifu showed up to offer me training in some sinister style that we got distracted before I could follow up on???
Its black heart.
Its always that damn style.
Omg I just found the best Asura's Wrath crossover thing.
Of course it had to be Jojo =p.
Needs Argus as third.
Imo Argus/Deus/??? as Pillarmen.
Maybe Olga idk.
See i put Argus with Yasha and Asura because he's both their sensei and while he isn't exactly on your side in the game he's really not on Deus' side either.
He's more on the side of fights drinking and hotsprings.
Deus should be with Olga and that creepy Vanity guy.
Who's I DIO though?
I don't think tihs game has a Dio.
Unless its the golden spider.
I think it's Vlitra.
For a much more literal THE WORLD.
Sure i can follow that logic.
And/or powers mirroring Asura's in the boss fight.
And talking of Jojo.
But Golden Spider / The final dlc boss has some timespot thingy iirc.
Anathema why is there a Pillarman in Tzeentch's army now?
I mean if its going to be in any chaos gods army.
Its going to be tzeentch.
Apparently that is Magnus himself.
Based on skype where I also linked that.
Yes that is Magnus the Red.
I imagined there would be more red.
Primarch of the Thousand Sons legion.
He's more pink-ish.
Well Tzeentch I suppose.
Being a primarch explains why he's so pillarman I suppose.
Also a callback to one of the first images of him.
He really likes impractical horns.
On his knee.
Blame John Blanche vOv.
Noelor because it's awesome?
I mean sure.
Also the dramatis personae w/ Ahriman. Guess he and Magnus made up and he's finished his readthrough of the Black Library.
It says something like that in the blurb yeah.
Ah yes so it does.
MoonWolf so a person who wants to boink robots is robosexual right?
What's the reverse?
Biophilic? idr which root is which.
I've never considered the term/idea before.
I think that's specifically humans.
From the perspective of... other sentient creatures? dragons I guess?
Antrhosexual is actually a uhm thing already.
Its people who are attracted to people.
But somehow hate pan i guess ?
Yay for ppl making words where words already exist.
I mean it'd be useful if we had you know.
Aliens or something.
MoonWolf pansexual implies you'd also be down for alien sex I suppose?
That was a thing in Torchwood.
Ofcourse it was.
Xenophile is the word you're looking for when it comes to aliens.
No see xenophile implies exclusivity towards aliens.
Well I did say alien sex =p.
Pan- with that context consolidates anthro- and xeno-sexual.
In the way that bi- consolidates andro- and gyno-sexual.
I think I prefer robofucker.
Yeah but what if the robot only wants to fuck flesh and blood things.
Tonights post overwatch mood incandescant rage.
Sounds about right.
Fuck you arms are optional.
Anathema> sounds like all of my post overwatch moods.
The reason why I've stopped playing PvP games and only stick to co-op.
Hee clever.
More of a horribly designed bardiche I think?
Jeez golden secret paladin at wild rank 20. how can people be so bad at the game.
Players on the PTR will now receive a special bag from normal Rift Guardians Djank M'iem a vendor who appears in each town hub in Adventure Mode and Campaign Mode.
They added an npc to the diablo 3 ptr called fucking DANK MEME.
!note MairBear.
Bum can't eat anything after 11.
Do I have a reaaaaally early lunch or try and last until dinner!?
I think I have meetings until 1045.
Thats pretty late.
Can't eat 4 hours before MRI.
We had a spreadsheet that was getting bloated with formulae and pivots so taking ages to load.
And I was asked to make a lite version that could load quickly.
Pivot tables it's an excel thing.
Anyway I just went into the folder and someone's already taken my lite version and started adding more pivots and formulae back in.
I made it last Friday.
MoonWolf grouping and aggregation in sql terms.
Minister they're HELPING.
Or perhaps Halping.
The Agonist are a good band.
Sounds like they're an agony to listen to P.
I hear rumours that SoB will be in the agents of the imperium book.
No exactly ideal but beats not having a new codex at all.
121333 › anathema I hear rumours that SoB will be in the agents of the imperium book - Not a rumor. It's in the book description P.
Now on the other hand the real rumor is that there's a possible Sisters of Battle Cannoness in plastic getting released by the end of the year.
Plastic sisters ahoy.
They wont release new rules for them in a print book without new models the old ones are ... bad.
Nah that book is a rules compendium so it'll most likely either be the old rules or a set of formations you can use for them.
That is balls.
Doesnt say they might get a proper codex later on vOv.
Apparently some people in England still pronounce face with a longer version of the a from cat.
Which I just can't render sensibly in my mind.
Also distracting myself trying to differentiate a and æ.
Ooh Kamala minifig.
Right so there's æ a and I can't even do it on my phone but a third on that's just d without the top bit.
It's how I'd actually write a.
Anyway according to Wikipedia only one dialect of Limburgish actually distinguishes all three of those.
Most languages just have 2/3 a's.
Anyway this makes it annoying that my text book refers to all three sounds separately.
Lol we just released an update of a product that supports windows server 2012.
Anathema hey thats still activly supported!
Anathema not even old shit.
Sorry I meant to convey that we just added support for windows server 2012 recently.
Another rpg kick$tarter.
So far FL has had great success with theirs.
But yes. Another one.
<< yesterday's quake in Japan some twitcher in Tokyo 150 mls away gets the shaking on camera.
I like how the first few ramp ups he doesn't even CARE.
Real sick of this whole ah crap we still only have 11 out of 12 after 2 secs of waiting better abandon the whole thing matchmaking.
Ow needs a system where no. of votes to proclaim a card epic is inverse proportional to number of cards per team.
No randomer on red team you did not get an epic you lost. you're just the only one red arguably wanna vote for. piss off.
Little salty there.
The Oversalt is real still.
Whoever designed this puzzle needs to be sent to the pachinko mines.
Ok so its a puzzle where you have to make blocks disappear by pushing them against blocks of the same color.
Simple enough so far. But then we get to the actual controls of this part.
You see the same button for grabbing onto the blocks is the same button for dash.
Did I mention the way to reset the puzzle is by running off the area?
Oh and you better be damn sure you are actually grabbing the block if your back is to a ledge because if you dash you bounce back 2 squares.
Also dash takes about .5 seconds to start and you automatically start the dash countdown if you hold the button while dropping the block off a ledge.
...AND THERES 20 LEVELS OF THIS BULLSHIT.
Oh I just noticed another detail. Usually when you are walking on a ledge the character goes into your typical teetering animation.
MairBear A BALANCED CARD.
Thank flip it's not rogue.
BwaS so imagine tihs.
You shuffle 3 of those into your deck.
Draw them over the course of the game.
Then fandral plus three of the.
Now you have an insane endgame.
Do we know what that is yet?
MairBear jade golems are a weird kind of thing.
The first one yo play is a 1/1 for 1 mana.
Next one is a 2/2 for 2.
Start at 1/1 every time something triggers a spawn/creation of one it goes up 1/1.
Manacost only relevant should it return to your hand somehwo.
The art gets prettier when it gets higher stats too.
BwaS i guess now we know why they needed art for a 30/30 version.
Its because of an infinite combo thing.
To get ancient one to see play.
Thats not happening.
Overwatch ptr now has Boop voiceline.
Got their priorities straight.
Jeez matched against players who've got a master skin on a hero only released last flipping week.
You know that gauntlet that was in the reveal cynematic and is on some of the payloads ?
Thats the Doomfist weapon of the hero doomfist.
Suppsedly there has been a few heroes named Doomfist.
I support Terry Crews for Doomfist.
I have no strong feelings one way or another.
Also it won't suprise you to know that doomfist was named by metzen.
I've only dreamed of such a thing.
I say the enemy mercy should get half credit on that.
Today in weird dutch news 32 year old man steals ambulance to sell cigarettes.
Yo I do not know if I wanna use Rattata or Meowth.
Also it takes a fucking age to get to a PC.
Though I've discovered that you can choose which pkmn to deposit when you catch your 7th which is v handy.
Though I've discovered that you can choose which pkmn to deposit when you catch your 7th which is v handy <- i thought this was in for 2 generaons already.
And nah iirc it just deposits the one you caught.
But this is relevant because it'll sufficiently reduce the time required to restart the game and get a starter into pkmn bank.
Minister what version did you get?
I am thinking about getting one since I heard they got rid of HMs and fixed the performance issues X/Y had.
And idk about performance.
But yeah HMs are replaced in a way they actually trialled in ORAS.
Your box with a question mark in it is not informative.
Is it silly emoji junk?
Because those will not render in a terminal.
Nor in mine but that I just blame on not having updated my irc client in ages v.
🌙 is a perfectly sensible emoji.
Or my fontface doesn't have it since I'm stuck on windows 7.
You could display it as an alchemical symbol.
It's a moon.
Some of my muscles keep twitching.
I blame the weird fluids I was injected with yesterday not my lack of sleep or stress.
Something something potassium.
I'll have you know since I eat bertrand I have an ample supply of potassium. I also had a banana with breakfast yesterday |.
Eat more bananas.
🌙🐺 <- yes ?
Damn it MoonMoon.
Well that's dickish Blizzard has Black Friday deals for all games except Diablo 3. Well and Hearthstone too but I'm not sure that counts.
Even fucking HOTS is listed on the sale page.
Alas I cannot find an oven nor a gun emoji for Cooked_Auto.
Why an oven? v.
Dont worry CA the HotS sale is just discounts on their most expensive skins and availability of a yr long stimpack.
Well I figured it was ingame content in that case just didn't see what.
Are the overwatch discounts for loot boxes or the boxed game?
The kidn you shouldn't be buying.
Think just the game ana.
40% off on the game.
MoonWolf> dont you talk shit about my mecha tass and space lord leoric.
Ftrbzzs ^^^ now is your chance me and Geoff still play regularly.
BwaS buying with money was I think the thing being denigrated.
Welp modded Torchlight 2 it is instead then I gues.
At least I can play with non-EU friends with that v.
Getting real sick of all these weekly mythic+ crates only dropping rings.
Now I am not saying this game has only bad guides but one was written in a manner that made me want to punch my monitor for showing such travesties and this one seems to assume the game has a drop rate 50% higher than it actually does.
By this point you should have a bazillion 50 crafting thingymabobs I had 15.
By this point you should have 3 spare poison amulets I had 1.
Anime mood lighting.
Gotta protect the masses from themselves we're all innocent things that will become irredeemable scum if we see anything exciting. Or something?
Define non conventional.
MoonWolf the article has some examples but includes spanking and caning.
Which are pretty tame.
Also female ejaculation.
So its just censorship then.
Fml trying to debug something.
-- The SQL statement is too big to show in the UI. -- For performance reasons we show just the first 50000 out of 114317 characters.
1749 columns in this select.
Wtf is this query doing.
A lot of wokr.
Possibly not very efficiently.
Well it's raising an error or I wouldn't be investigating.
I wonder if I can use adblock to remove the evolution section from bulbapedia pages.
To prevent spoilers ?
....95 left outer joins.
Anathema the fuck.
I asked sql server for the estimated execution plan it had to think about it for a few seconds.
13 seconds to get top 50.
>cached plan size 5034 KB.
Steam autumn sale has started btw.
You can nominate games for the first Steam award now apparently.
If I can figure out how.
And the answer was yes!
The answer is I can block that section on one pokémon's page.
Not for all of them.
Oh hey sales. maybe I'll see if I can finally buy oblivion this year.
Probably TES franchise is on sale.
Its still 10e.
I dont think its going to get lower because lol Bethesda.
I have a baby busbug and a pearlbird.
Pokémoon is going well.
And here I thought this game wasn't going to throw anything TOO bullshit in my way.
An enemy just stole 10k XP from one character.
I got about 500xp from that fight I think.
Hm would've thought I'd get more than 20 fps on Torchlight 2 nowadays but I guessn ot.
Yeah I dunno.
I turned down some settings but the framerate was according to steam just around 20. No idea why.
Might be the Torchlight 2 essentials mod doing it for all I know.
Guess not. Weird /.
MoonWolf Full long.
Cooked_Auto aliens vs predator 4!
Urgh match.com keep spamming me and I can't delete my account because I can't remember my password ¬_¬.
Block their mail.
Just mark it as spam.
Will have to sort that out tonight don't really want to be seen using that website at work.
Did you manage to fix the query from hell you were staying late for last night ?
Yes it is still a hellishly complex query though I wasn't fixing any of that yet.
Dozens and dozens of left outer joins.
Its never going to be simple.
MoonWolf actual issue.
I mean it's possible there are RBMS where the casings of columns in your query matters but it does not for sqlserver or oracle and NH knows what DB you are querying against.
MoonWolf it only takes 1272ms on average to get 50 records from that monstrous query.
There are worse performing ones.
Beating a patron warrior on wild ladder with a 'play all of the murlocs' questing deck.
Fuck you patron warriors.
I'll give this much ot the new doom soundtrack It does sound much better with a decent woofer.
Wouldn't be much of a doom soundtrack without a good baseline.
Yeah but the one in this goes to extremes. I dont think my headphones can pick up some of those notes.
Like this my headphones cant pick up the lowest notes on the bass riff.
I do have to wonder how low do those notes go because my headphones seem to be fine down to 32hz or so.
Maybe they're just not accurate enough.
Well according to my brother who read a guide the WoD legendary ring is still BiS for arcane mage.
That seems something blizzard said they would purposefully avoid.
Dunno how true that is. Guess the on use effect might be worth 1700 int or so.
Also without spoilers there was a thing that happened in FF's 3.3 story that made me yell at the screen because of it being stupid.
And in 3.4 it proved I was right to yell at the screen.
Oh boy oh boy I can hardly wait.
Hmm I don't quite get that the highest you get it to is 815 and the proc at 110 only gives you like a 1% and the blast is for zilch.
At least it was levelling with my maxed out wod ring.
Could be I never owned the ring so I dont know its limitations at 110.
Yeah I assumed they'd do the same thing they did with the cloaks less and less proc rate until it was just the stats at 100.
And in 3.4 it proved I was right to yell at the screen. <- is uriangier evil afterall ?
FULL LONG MoonWolf.
I could answer that in IM though. I just wouldn't want to give definitive spoiler one way or the other in this chat.
I'll keep that unspoiled in case i decied to binge FF plot at some point.
Or for when the SA LP finally arrives there.
3 years from now.
Whichever comes first.
You say binge the plot you mean start the game soar through plot until the first dungeon and then grind for a couple of days to be able to get in..
Well i'd be starting from my current Whitemage/Lancer levels.
And i had not quite ready for raiding level gear back then.
So it can't take THAT long ?
Well also when you stopped the farmable seals gave 170 gear.
And now they give 230 gear. And you can buy 200 with the Clan Hunt seals.
I think i still have some seals so that'd be a quick few pieces too.
And i don't mind you know.
Running some dugeons for the rest.
Yeah the most expensive slot is chest legs at 120 or I guess weapon at 140. And you get 75 from the level 3 clan hunt bounty and a quick 100 from the weekly mob.
Not like i didn't do literally every single dungeon available at 50 a ton while going through all the post release base content.
Plus they added a new item that has got people doing all the older content again.
Or is it just another stage of the grindy weapon from hell ?
Ah yes competitive season 2 closes and now quickmatch becomes an unbalanced clusterfuck.
Great job blizz.
BwaS you ready for those symmetra changes ?
Matchmaking even worse than hearthstone and heroes combined!
Oh the grindy weapon continues on its own but this thing is a book you get 16 tasks 12 of which are random 8 of those are often 'difficult'. You only need to complete 9 of the tasks before you're capped for the week though.
Oh another log.
What does it do ?
And each task puts a sticker on a 4x4 grid like so.
You do get an option to reroll the placement but only if you have between 3 and 7 stickers collected.
And if you get 3 lines which is a 2% chance at best with rerolls used to get an ideal 7 set up you get very good gear.
But the fact that it targets old Extreme dungeons means people are back into doing them for more than just the mount farming.
Does it also encourage people to do old raids ?
So newbies can actually see them ?
Yeah especially since you get a reroll token in this book on top of the old rewards for new people who haven't done it yet.
EG this week I had World of Darkness last week Syrcus Tower.
And even some wings of the Alexander stuff in the first patch.
Reroll token ?
Yeah the book gives you a second chance token when you do anything with someone new to that duty. You can spend 1 of them to restore a completed duty to incomplete or two of them to shuffle the stickers on the grid.
Restoring the duty lets you get a second sticker from it and also flags a random uncompleted duty. So if you just can't find a group for the raid stuff and want to farm the easy 4 1-49 dungeon 50 dungeon 51-59 and 60.
To get even better lines for better gear ?
In theory but it's like a 20% chance to get two lines. At best.
As when you hit 9 stickers that's your lot for this week.
Plus if I got 2 lines I'd take the minion.
!note MairBear.
Plasma grenade on Chrysses!?
Because regular 'lids were not scary enough yet.
MoonWolf so in Great Gubal Library Hard.
THere's a book that explains why it's Cure I Cure II and so on instead of cure cura.
4th book.
Also first book has some notworthyness.
No wonder Amdapor was lost.
Too busy giving spells bad names.
Also they added a right-click report for RMT option if whispered.
So since then I have never been whisp'd by a goldseller xD.
Took long enough.
MoonWolf at 5 hp loads of minions on board but all mine have 4 or more hp cast excavated evil.
It summons hallazeal.
Grats on finding a use for one of my wotog ledgies.
Oh my god.
What am I even watching.
Finland set to become first country to ban coal use for energy sweeet.
Really? that's news.
Anathema where'd you read that from?
Also guess that's also rephrasing that we use more nuclear now.
The government is considering banning the burning of coal for energy by 2030.
Which means nothing.
Makes a nice headline though!
Did you buy Overwatch yet?
No.. about to.
I keep being interrupted by work.
Which annoys me.
I might even have time to play tonight.
I have a slightly hairy Diglett now.
Will it turn into a slightly hair dugtrio ?
A fabulously hairy Dugtrio.
Do you have or are you planning to get an tall egxecute ?
Probably not I started with Rowlett.
Otoh half my party are birds right now.
Be an all bird party.
Or at least an all wings party.
Depends how Pearl-Bird evolves.
Damn forgot I'd run out of food powder.
You'll have to eat Real Food.
Also I have no notes.
Oh ok I've got like £7 in change I will be able to eat p.
Your wallet must be heavy as hell.
>still using cash in 2016.
I don't keep change in my wallet.
Also £7 could be as few as 4 coins.
Noelor willing to bet its fake scottish change too.
That's not a thing.
It's more like 12 coins.
The scottish mints for whatever reason only print notes.
I did not know that.
That seems weird.
Do cots just not believe in change ?
Do they do the change in pounds ?
There is literally no reason you would know that.
And idk why.
Yeah coins are still tender in scotland.
My PearlBird is now significantly less Pearlesque.
Whats even the point.
MoonWolf zaftig pretzels.
Not a word i'm familiar with.
Is it german ?
Looks it but idk.
Well that's certainly some AW DLC.
Also the commerical break...
It was great.
4 birds now.
I added an electric cheerleader.
Is it also a bird ?
The 4th bird is an electric cheerleader bird.
Pokémon still one heckuva drug.
I love how dunked on Team Skull are rn.
Can't wait for them to blow up a volcano because of it.
But they're teen punks.
Stolen tagged up drill castle.
I need to go into town and get that tomorrow.
SHame that I missed the Genesect code too D.
Unrelated to bird count my handbag is a melon slice and it's v cute.
This seems impractical.
Try using an actual bag.
Its going to be swarming with fruitflies those are not cute.
No need to be jealous of melonbag.
Sure fucking pisses me off when sombrero's VA snarkily talks about game objective when she's off halfway across the map fucking a health pack.
That hacked healthpack is critical to the obective!
MoonWolf did you see... I think it was Clove's tweets about Sombrettra?
I don't remember.
I don't disagree.
But its a horrible ship.
I'm glad we agree.
I mean yes she's part of the Talon family anyway with Reaper and WM.
This has never stopped widowtracer even a little bit.
Loving the enemy and so forth.
Yeah family is different to romance Cooked_Auto.
This isn't Japan.
If this was japan she'd be adopted and reaper would want to have sex with her.
Never implied it was romantic. She just hasn't time for all that due to crazy family antics =I.
We're all antics now.
Dreamhack hs doing a brilliant job displaying the breadth of the meta right now. every round a zoolock mirror.
You forgot the shamans.
Theyre all banned out.
Accidentally playing in wild.
Bahaha went yolo on team league in hots with a cho'gall pick and we actually won the map D.
Great. I just noticed that this game doesn't have a remove equipment from your summon button.
Instead it has a delete this gear from your summon button.
Which game ?
Wild arms 3.
Nvm played a wild arms game myself.
With everything else the game is fairly lenient.
But I just realized I put the healing item buffer gear on the wrong summon.
Summons also grant you spells and stats.
Lol did hots team league placements just for funsies for a guaranteed reward mount at end of season.
Landed just one portion of a division beneath hero league where I supposedly tryhard.
Good gods forgot tot download flip flappers ep8 yesterday.
You say that when there's another mahou shoujo rolling where they don't go kemonomimi as a 1 ep throwaway gimmick.
I have told no lies.
The fact that every episode is some kind of throwaway gimmick is a part of why I love this series.
Also those are extraordinary.
What a bitch.
Cooked_Auto I swear to gods.
Please don't post pokémoon spoilers.
Wasn't aware that they were.
That Tangled one being borderline.
Sonic boom is weird in that its awful and great at the same time.
Actually no. any episode with eggman in it is great by default. everything else is terrible.
In pokémoon I can now ride around on one of these.
And it has the best gait.
Also omg its Japanese name.
I did not realize it was that big.
1.2m tall according to that page.
While the new pokemon does have the best starter pokemon since gen 1 still sadly not enough to be worth 300euros or whatever it would cost to get a 3DS and the game.
I heard its pretty dope.
Oh boy the time I have dreaded has come.
Since I haven't actually been anywhere in a month or two I will now have to spend the next 30 minutes untangling my hair.
Mm I realized a while ago my hair is getting annoyingly long enough for me that I almost need a comb to straighten it out properly and get rid of all the knots.
Ah the pokédex.
What silly things is it claiming now ?
Although it's too sugary for human consumption Bounsweet's sweat can be watered down into a juice with just the right amount of sweetness.
Thats a bit creepy.
Yes but this is pokemon we are talking about.
Ah yes also as ever the best entries are for ghosts.
If for some reason Drifloon's body bursts its soul spills out with a screaming sound.
How many people are they horribly killing and or draining of life essence this game ?
Drifloon is the kidnapping baloon pokémon.
Is that its official title ?
Officially Balloon Pokémon.
But famous for its pokédex entries in previous generations casually pointing out that it will often float away with children.
From Y These Pokémon are called the Signpost for Wandering Spirits. Children holding them sometimes vanish.
Pokedex version of pokemon world continues to be a terrifying place.
On the bright side many Pokémon enjoy longer life spans thanks to Magikarp.
I'm putting this Magikarp on my team.
Until I find a local water type I like better.
Isn't there an aloha gyrados ?
!note MairBear Give Normalium-Z to a Magikarp.
I'll find out though I guess!
I googled i was wrong.
It was a fake spoiler >.>.
Were you thinking of Mega?
Its a really neat fake spoiler though dragon/psychic.
Seems relevant.
Picked up my mug to take to wash up still coffee in it.
Free cold old coffee.
Technically cold coffee is a thing.
It is the default coffee in japan.
One friend of one of the owners of the café has his coffee in a latte glas and diluted with water.
Coffee cold sweet in a can.
Japan is weird that way.
Starbucks must hate japan.
Starbucks is actually alright there.
I looked up exaggerate because I'd forgotten how many doubles are in it.
Got distracted by its phonetics /ɪɡˈzadʒəreɪt/.
You can't just put a 3 in there.
What does that even mean.
Ʒ is uh.
Sec lemme find a good reference.
If I had to guess its that kind of a slurred z sound.
Also my estimates of 30 minutes were entirely too optimistic.
It's a voiced palato-alveolar sibilant if that helps.
But yeah Glenn has the right idea.
It's also in consonant in the middle of vision.
It's a voiced palato-alveolar sibilant if that helps <- it really doesn't.
Only the sibilant part does.
And the final consonant in garage which is actually given as an example of its use in Dutch on wikipedia but valid in English too.
But... those words are pronounced completly differently in dutch and english.
Complain to wikipedia.
No examples from swed/finnish on that page.
Anyway I've named my Magikarp Mr. Fish because references.
I wonder what Eurogamer are using instead of é.
That isn't showing up in my fontset.
If its any consolation it doesnt do it on mine either.
No examples from swed/finnish on that page <- cant think of any myself. just not a sound used in the Finnish language.
MairBear I just got my Rockruff to high-five me!
What does that do ?
Idk how far through MairBear is yet.
But giving pokémon Z-rocks is how you unleash powerful Z-moves.
They have to already have a basic move that matches the type of the Z hough.
And it'll upgrade into a Z-move based on what base move is being upgraded.
I haven't even.
Actually googled sun vs moon differences.
Moon applies a 12-hour time difference.
Noelor so then it upgrades Splash into some better Z move.
Thats hopefully a bit more impactfall than splash.
Oh really that few differences?
Guess I'll go moon!
MairBear I mean version-exclusive pkmn as ever.
Yeah but less older ones are gated.
As awesome as alolan vulpix is.
Ah yes also the less freaky evolution of rockruff.
Going on the very serious xcom deployement Operation Tickle Gun.
You're truly doomed.
Yer screwed mate.
!note MairBear You went on operation Moon Tuna and as a rookie did the most damage. Then you decided to be a Shinobi. So i'm going to make you a axe wielding maniac.
Also Tracer decided to be a physhic sniper.
So thats a thing.
So you're saying... Mind Bullets?
Nexus Challenge finished. Guess I can go back to playing the game now =P.
I'm fighting a trainer called a Sightseer.
Who's recording the whole thing on her smartphone.
What a sight to behold.
At the end of the fight she took a selfie in a 3c pose.
Well wouldn't want pokemon to get outdated.
Well it is sunday.
The best.
Time for a new attempt at a xcom 2 campaign.
Hopefully without suffering terrible mod failure this time.
This bug is on my team and she's great.
Why does it have a helemet ?
Dimensional activity? Oh you must be referring to...
Phone screenshot because 3DS image share isn't working rn.
Not just any wormhole.
The ULTRA WORMHOLE.
It just shows up in the sky sometimes.
Thats not a worrying event at all.
That professor thinks it might be legendary but is probably real.
I stepped out of her lab and immediately saw it appear for a second.
Ofcourse you did.
Okay after more changes to mods.
Hopefully THIS attempt at a xcom 2 campaign will stick.
Also this is in my party now.
It looks sort of evil.
I think it just likes fights.
Love the intros in this. I mean Its no wild arms 1 but its still great.
Or rather they since they change slightly through the game.
Wait no thats the wrong version even.
The vocals in the intro are great as well so its a pity to link just the whistle version.
Team Skull's Big Sister comes up to me.
You have realised what idiots all these guys are right?
They being team skull ?
Even she thinks her gang is composed of idiots.
Hey i apreciate an evil team that realizes that maybe they are not the smartest bunch around.
But don't you think some dummies are cute in their dumbness? I mean.
Not really ?
Meanwhile the Wormhole scientist from earlier has not worked out that the wrestler she likes is her husband.
Why is her husband leading a secret second life as a wrestler to begin with ?
Because Science doesnt always pay the bills.
Science is too boring I guess?
Nothing wrong with a hobby.
Hmm apparently trolden in november counts as archaic freeze mage footage from february...
Help I can't progress the story any further in pokémoon without going to a desert island with a guy who talks like a cult leader.
So despite the weird 20-25fps limit I have on Torchlight 2 it still plays without issue so I guess it tides me over until I cave in and buy D3RoS.
I got 'somewhere' on TL2 until I reached a boss that was basically impossible with my chosen build and respeccing wouldn't work out.
Then I modded the shit out of it to add legendary loot pinata from the getgo making it too easy for me to enjoy it p.
Running just with the essentials mod right now.
Well that was a boss. it attacked me like 12 times with what I assume would have been heavy damage attacks and then just died.
But from farming I had all elemental resistances so I just sat there wondering where my turn was.
Huh. apparently that was the second to last boss in the game or something and I accidentally skipped half the dungeon.
Jesus christ how many forms does this boss have.
I think thats number 6 or 7.
Well I guess it was the graphics driver update requiring a reboot because now I've got like 400fps in the main menu for Torchlight 2.
I think the reason is Z-Splash.
I need to watch SteinsGate.
Urgh the Vita game only has english subs not voice.
For a game?
What a weeaboo.
Danganronpa's excellent voice acting has spoiled me.
Look i can either embrace the fact that dubs > subs.
Or go around demanding evreyting be dubbed INTO DUTCH.
What a load of rubbish. I thought it was a game but it turns out to be a animated story. Wasted my money and time.
Well maybe you should have figured out what you were getting before you go it.
Is otome game = visual novel?
Technically its VN targeted at a female audience.
Virtually all of them are basically dating sims and nothing more.
I suppose the cover should hgave been a give-away.
Could have been a male oriented one too ?
Not enough gratuitious cleavage.
Summary for this game.
A Cataclysmic Whodunnit! Spoiler-Free Zone Psychic Warlords Keep Your Friends Close...
Keep your friends close anathema.
May My faith in God will guide our path out of Europe.
How the fuck is god going to help you with thise.
The bible doesn't really have shit all to say about exiting complex international unions.
Anathema the PC version was in japanese I think?
Steinsgate that is. not sure how much that conversation progressed while I was DC'd.
For my next JRPG I realized I never actually got far in dragon quest 8 with friends. so that should keep me occupied for a week or so.
Stupid fingers need to stop hurting.
Are there any bodyparts you have that are nto currently randomly in pain in a given week ?
Not randomly took a couple weeks off playing guitar and lost my callouses.
1100 properties one of which has a runtime cast error that ssms does not pinpoint.
I know i wouldn 't.
Don't suppose the trace at least gives you a clue as to what properties could be being accessed at the moment ?
That list of 1100 and Conversion failed when converting from a character string to uniqueidentifier. is all I get.
That was fairly fast.
Not many strings being used then ?
No there's buttloads I just had a hunch that proved to be correct.
I hear the proud tradition of burning down a giant goat went down well in sweden this year.
It burned down again then ?
Didn't last a day.
While I am usually against pointless vandalism I can't stop being amused by this.
I have to wonder why they keep building them and then investing so much into getting it to not burn down.
It has already burnt down once while it was built so why stop?
Is this goat like some horse of troy?
Nah its just a traditional giant christmas goat.
MairBear new HS legendary Wrathion draw cards from your deck untill you draw a card that ISN'T a dragon.
6 mana 4/5 with taunt.
So i knwo what i need to craft for my dragon priest deck.
Oh did I miss the start dang *radio silence* *waits for vod*.
The only reveal you missed so far was wrathion.
BwaS quality priest bm on stream.
Is there any other priest?
If you’re going to have a box full of boobs at least go the whole hog and have players battling a disgusting boob god you know? sound logic.
But why would you even want to use minis from Kingdom Death?
BwaS apparently my skype got hacked in the weirdest way.
Also this card is mediocre but the art is great.
Noelor> hmm I see it. def a weird hack.
Thank you google. I started wondering what the hell something was and it was the first result from googling japanese bamboo thing.
Is it that thing that goes CHOCK!?
Even if I would consider it more a dunk.
So the Blizzard store has a sale for shirts as low as 7.20usd.
You know Cooked_Auto.
Some people may say you're a bad friend for letting me know of this.
If it makes you feel any better you're not the first one I told this.
If my bank account were sentient for instance.
Okay on the reveal vod now.
Frodan is so far really behind on the click everything! meta.
Wrathion isn't tagged dragon. wat. I mean. wattttttt.
That does seem incorrect.
Is it okay to have a 0 mana 8/8 taunt is that fair? arcane giant says hi.
8/8 is practically its own taunt.
I phrased that poorly but w/e.
Alex in dragon priest. wat.
Turns out pirate taunt warrior with a lot of conditionals and zero card draw doesn't work out P.
King's elekk doesn't win a joust yep must be one of mine.
More hunter secrets! yes! more cards to add to my deck to never draw before after both cloaked huntresses are dead!
Buffing doomsayer well that's one way to ensure the end comes about.
Y'all owe it to yourselves to watch Kuvo's newest LP btw.
Which is ?
For instance I turned away for two seconds to type this and this was on screen and I have no idea what the context is.
Guess i'll give that a shot.
I rewound for context it didn't really help.
The best postnote.
That one time Santa and a Gingerbread man shot the goat with flaming arrows is probably the best one.
Some Team Skull grunts were stealing a bus stop.
Because why not.
As I chased them off one says Yo think about the bus drivers! They won't have to stop here if we take the sign!
If we can set up sergeant sally. this is starting to sound like a preschool tv programme.
New neutral ledge 3 mana 1/1 deathrattle deal damage to enemy minions equal to atk.
Its art is great too.
Some Team Skull grunts were stealing a bus stop <- exactly what is team skulls overacharching goal here ?
That may be their answer as well as mine.
Do they even have one ?
Well I have a prediction.
Please do tell.
But I know Mair's well behind me.
Do you care enough about ~pokémon lore~ for me to PM you?
Ultimatly not really.
Oh dear.
Pokémoon in which I am accompanied by Good Dogs.
I wish I could find a good video of Stoutland that wasn't just a twitch archive of someone awful streaming it.
In the world of 2016 we don't do quality anymore.
I love how pointless this card's art is.
Can't wait to see golden.
Team Skull what does our team even do ? we don't know but we're doing it anyway.
Thats probably a bridge behind him but i'm secretly hoping its a giant robot.
Playing pokémon on my lunch break at work.
Time for an audio quiz!
I'm assumign this is recognize the pokemon by weird digitized cry sounds ?
Only 1/3 so far.
First was was that the sound of a pkmn centre or an item?
Second was uh pokédex update vs some other stuff.
Those first two should be common enough you can regocnize them.
Just looked awkward holding the ds to my at low volume.
Bring earbuds next time ?
I don't actually currently have headphones with a 3.5mm jack.
Enjoy the awkwardness then.
Or just skip the quizzes at work.
It's just this one trial.
I wish I knew what was up with my internet this time.
Its slowing down because its cold.
We're playing RPG's this week right?
No we are not ?
Oh no yes. i think so.
So Visual Basic.
What about it ?
Colleague and I just spent about a quarter hour puzzling over why a function wasn't working.
It works in this other macro it's a basic function.
We try calling it differently still breaks.
Then we realise that it is not working because he's accidentally used that basic function name as the name for his subroutine in which it's being called.
Also why did it even let you do that.
A you let us call a new subroutine Format.
B surely calling a routine inside itself should be a specific error message.
You can claim its 3C but i'm pretty sure its still sub zero.
Minister it shouldn't because recursion is a thing.
I mean also it meant it was using the wrong args.
Its okay you figured it out in the end.
Only because we gave up and went to the top of the page to define it as a string instead.
Your function might have gotten to damn big.
It's not mine.
I was just helping him debug.
His might have gotten to damn big then.
They tend to.
We are not properly trained coders.
You at least do fine for someone who just make macros every now and then.
On the whole you get done what you want to do.
As long as this work then doesn't get used as critical company infrastucture its fine imho.
Well thats a terrible idea.
Battlenet down time to revive the steam library for first time in months =P.
TAIL HOOK.
Oh boy oh boy I hope this shit fixes itself by tomorrow.
I hope so too.
Huh InControl from the SC2 scene is gonna be hanging with Relic for DoW3 stuffs that's cute.
Ah jeez wrathion's flavour text Wrathion son of Deathwing is a dragon. Why isn't he tagged as a dragon you ask? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO BLOW HIS COVER??
BwaS getting a bit meta with that text.
I... I... i just won against what may have been a rationally constructed renolock playing a lowest curve imaginable play X druid cards deck.
And erm now that was a dragon nzoth? reno? priest that fell to my blade.
!note MairBear FUNNEL CAKE.
Redditor u/greatmambojambo brilliantly explains how Irexit Ireland leaving the EU is fundamentally different from Brexit and would thoroughly hurt Ireland's economy for decades to come. THAT ISN'T DIFFEFENT TO WHAT BRITAIN IS DOING.
But UK is not a corp tax country Ireland is.
There is the difference.
UK is just fucking things up on other levels.
Yes we are p.
But UK is not a corp tax country Ireland is <- instead London just has a financial industry dependant on EU open market instead.
My OCR buddy at work is trying to get me to sign up to something called Relentless Suffering.
Which is the weekend after my half marathon.
Sounds like a good way to get muscle cramps.
Anathema sounds awful you should play at home instead.
Its good that they are a real actual group that exists.
Dont think I will be getting revelator any time soon since I still haven't been able to ge the previous one running at solid 60FPS.
Also slowly getting back into scribbling bad drawings.
<- some people are playing Baldurs Gate on downright ridiculous resolutions.
I am sure they have a good reason for this.
Because they can.
....so I did my semi annual check on twitter.
And for some reason 2 of my posts are gone.
Look now I have to make 2 tweets.
And then stop again.
I'm sure they'll be amazing tweets.
I was thinking of oh twitter deleted 2 of my tweets and oh well. back at 123 posts now. Bye.
Well LFR this week dropped an 870 cloak. think I'll take that.
Soooo this RPG thing.
Doing late minute things.
Also waiting on noelor.
Also missing a noelor it seems.
Oh must've missed the date reshuffle.
Gah sorry sorry forgot.
OW queues doing a great job at giving you the impression only 9 other people in the region want to play the game at the same time as you.
Well hopefully that solves the problem. Got one of those lovely messages from my ISP going pssst hey kid there's some kind of DDOSbot coming from your network.
And now I've been running scans on all the computers in the network all day.
That explains stuff.
If it was that one thing I found on this computer I just wish where the hell I got it from.
*wish I knew where the hell.
Yeah I got careless last week and managed to get a bitcoiner on my machine after hunting for working The Grand Tour torrents but I closed that pretty quickly and got it quarantined and the host program deleted Thank fuck that FreeCommander can see extra hidden files.
Ok plan C lets see if updating the firmware on my modem helps.
NWN1 is free on GoG btw.
For the next 48h.
Ok pretty sure my router had been compromised.
After the update there's 3 log entries from dropped remote accesses.
Do a factory reset?
Will try that again if I get dropped in next 30 minutes.
Ok pretty sure my router had been compromised <- ugh but yeah that happens.
MairBear apparantly noggenfogger randomizes your emotes.
On the bright side I finally had an excuse to run full antivirus and malware checks.
MoonWolf> initially I was thinking noggenfogger elixir.
Nope actually the guy who made it.
Hearthhead on Gadgetzan Craft the safest neutral legendaries possible << like Ragnaros and Sylvanas.
Nothing better than a trolden segment of a salty russian badmouthing everything about his opponent and getting smacked down.
Salty russian sounds like some sort of drink.
This is 90% of my reinhardt play.
Is it not just the average DotA player MoonWolf?
Btw I caught the cutest gorram pokémon last night.
Its a butterfly with a shawl ?
A very strong tiny moth-fairy with a comfy scarf.
Its bug/fairy but gets phychic moves ?
Psychic and HP are both from TM.
Well it wouldn't be the first pokemon to have some moves from the wrong types on its list.
If I only taught my pokémon same-type moves I would be a Bad Trainer.
I meant on the natural list of moves it learns on levelup.
Like the first one I can give you is butterfree gets confusion.
I would say the rarer instance is actually pokémon that *only* learn same-type moves.
Unless you discount normal.
Yeh I kinda was.
Noelor i was discounting normal yeah.
Ok then first in dex order will actually be a Char-.
Checked 'mander indeed learns Dragon Rage.
Should have just been dragons damnit.
But it's fixed 40 dmg so egh.
And think it was just dragons and gyarados in gen1 barring TM.
Shit pokemon why are you so low-key GRIM all the time.
Those café dudes are great.
Very true Hau.
BwaS i have an 80 gold quest if you are interested.
Yeah sure why not.
Such a peach 3.
Z moves are increasingly ridiculous.
My tiny fairymoth just wrapped her foe in a coccoon of webbing chucked it over her head as a pendulum swung it along the ground like Hector then chucked it in the air before cutting the coccoon open finishing off its contents.
Whats the power on that move ?
Can't actually check out of combat.
But I think Z-moves are minimum 100.
's a good bit of damage.
As shown here Z-moves base their power on what move they're... Z-ing?
So Tess' Savage Spin-Out does 175 because she Z's Bug Buzz into it.
190 for megahorn.
Z-moves have either perfect or always 100 accuracy.
So they're all massive hurt you now moves.
They don't display accuracy I've never seen even the rock ones miss.
They're broadly 100-200 power yeah.
Can they crit ?
You only get one per battle though.
Don't think so.
Haven't noticed it.
Had in chat a 'switch off hanzo I want to play him' on quickmatch. amazed it took that long this patch.
Stop this nonsense.
And give me my zany gangsters.
MairBear there is currently a bug where the 3 class cards are three times as likely to be found in a pack.
So you probably want to wait with getting packs untill they fix that anyway.
Supposedly just been hotfixed and they're giving NA 33% extra pax as compensation.
Hotfix applied to other region rollour.
Oh jeez blizz heard who my least favourite hero is and made getting the next 1000g utterly painful.
At least it can't be as bad as last week.
Last week's one had a round timer of about 2 mins max so no.
But... it was abysmal.
I got the cannon team all 3 games and hated them all with a passion.
Hau is so fucking oblivious.
Well the way I see it this one will be 9 qm nova mains plus you where they see your shimmer even when you're in the bushes.
I am so grateful that you only have to play them at least.
The arena ones have been okay and there was one that was simply aram those were fine.
I can't believe pokémoon turned out to be a Kill la Kill crossover.
I mean the cat designed by trigger should have hinted at it.
You know when you m.
...put it that way.
Also the power of fashion returning.
That was actually a good boss fight.
Cabin fever pre gadget release I've even built an excel template for opening bonanza.
I wonder if the golden legendary column will get any use P.
Haven't seen that many streamers in one place since... well... kara.
Or WotOG or EL or ... etc etc.
If I watch any of the NA 'stoners I'm just gonna get tilted tonight so been watching some OW instead.
Seems to be finally out on our side though.
Oh is it?
And I get to fight a pirate warrior.
THat has a perfect curve.
Dead by turn 6 c.
Sucks to meet the pirate warrior on the one game in ten their curve actually works.
I don't think that paladin knew Gorehowl can hit face...
Cos they spent 4 mana first then cast forbidden healing to bring themself up to 16... when I had 12 from minions and a 6/1 gore.
Right 13 packs with gold.
> cues epic sax.
I'll have a whole... 630 when i do this quest xP.
1 rogue legendary!
But hey 6 packs + the quest ones is fine.
30 dust of duplicates from 13 fresh pax XD.
2 goldens in druid inc an epic.
Only 2 hunter cards.
Rogue also drew the Fourth Rager.
Hmm collection search needs a tri-class string.
Either that or it doesn't come to me naturally...
Ohshi- railgun now on crunchyroll. Oh. US/CA only. Well screw you.
Ha ha ha time for proxies.
In todays episode of Flip flappers Do not believe her lies. Or hers.
New cards equals new decks and new meta!
Hah nope aggro shaman and c'thun druid.
Like it's wotog launch week.
BwaS oh boy oh boy my brother persuaded me to play quick match.
We got with a diablo that chased minion camps during objectives and aoe heroes who were blind to the shimmer of the enemy nova and zera.
Lemme guess nova zeratul samuro teabagging gank squad on red team?
Nova got 10/24/0.
I was li li so couldn't do shit even if I saw the shimmer.
Lesse lili against stealthies is like maybe a chained vortex/dragon bounce hit off a visible target.
Nah it wasn't a bullshit team just we had no one who was both willing and able to deal with the sneakers. And lost every immortal.
Or standing in the water dragon aoe.
Unranked draft might give you some sanity.
And now we're lkosing to bots. Because lili uther muradin johanna and nova.
I'm the Johanna. I died I checked recap 0 heals.
What is my life right now.
Well I'm getting legend card back control warriors at fucking rank twenty fucking two.
OH LOOK another golden wanker at rank 21.
Blizzard is falling over themselves competing who has the worst matchmaking.
Ah and our muradin starts calling our lili and uther retards and autists and then saying he's gonna report them on forum and knows a GM.
I wonder which the more reportable offense is what he's doing or being bad at games and in vs AI.. hmm hmm hmmmm.
Report the fucker hard.
Man this ogre from chicago with the painted on moustache got old really really fast.
It's a z-ring not a monring >C.
By which I mean hello.
Did you sleep at all ?
Time to open some packs!
*hops on to spy on legends*.
MoonWolf none? Or is HS just not pinging? C.
Ui got 1 so far.
Which is a bit dissapointing since it was sergeant sally.
There we go.
Also ugh D.
2 legendaries that i was not interested in.
In 90 packs.
MoonWolf it's spelled ...and Knuckles fyi.
A lady just straight-up gave me an Aerodactyl.
Not even an Old Amber.
How old was she though.
Maybe she was there.
And has hundreds of them.
I mean Ace Trainer model so.
Oh. I read old lady cos brain did that thing where I skimmed.
Also I just bought a Zumongous bowl of noodles for 500P.
Is.... is it shaped like a zubat?
Nah it's just so big it's Z-powered.
I think I've won this one.
MairBear dragonfire potion though.
True and they did draw a few things to steal my board and heal up a bit.
Dragon Priest Dragon Priest. Crafting Wrathion was totally worth it Dragon Priest.
Hrm xchat imploded and I only just realised.
Imploded how ?
Hour and a half ago it just sort of locked up couldn't click it I thought it was the PC in general so I closed down the likely offender steam and thought it worked.
So I realised a few mins ago and task managered it away.
MoonWolf another FFXIV free-login period of 4 days played has popped up.
Dun have time.
Well it's until like Jan 4th or something but understood just mentioning.
Ermg a house for sale in ff.
Quick BUY IT.
Ouch my monies.
Had to make a withdrawal from retainers but overall that's still less than 40% of my total funds. And I could make more if I could be bothered.
Are houses limited stock?
MairBear what ward btw ?
Yeah on some realms it's pretty impossible.
MoonWolf The Goblet.
Its not lavender beds b ut it beats the mist i suppose.
I like that I can hear a difference between my work and PC computers in this music from the same source with the same headset dedicated sound cards are totally worth it.
I'm on a moderate to light server I think. And this was the only plot on sale out of... I think it's 1440.
GlennCuttlefish they're doing another FFXIV free-period.
96 hours from today until Jan 4th or something like that.
Guess I'll install it later tonight.
Or update? Not sure I ever deleted it.
Sturdy Love Fool - Renamed from Ex-Boyfriend Dummy. Description removed Because stabbing the real thing is illegal.
WoW patch notes on the PTR apparently.
There was a Ex Boyfriend Dummy ?
I guess? Or it was an item they were gonna release that caught flak or they changed their mind on.
Bullshit Dva shield doesn't block flashbang?
It blocks the projectile not the explosion.
So if he detonates it outside ofyour fuck all projectiles cone.
He was inside the zone when he threw it at me.
There was a bastion behind him.
Anathema I have learned to despise bad teams in Overwatch.
Is this what the game is all about.
Growing the hatred inside me.
Anathema what have you done??
My game doesn't have music anymore either for some reason.
!note MairBear.
Oh oblivion. return to town and suddenly there is a bounty on my head for...reasons.
Wish I knew what those reasons were.
You were mean to someone.
I mean I was mean to a whole lot of people what with being a murderhobo but I wish at what point was I under the jurisdiction of imperial law. We all know that the long arm of the law does not extend into caves.
Gotta love when an early game mulch gives your opponent an exceptionally playable early game minion in return.
Because of course ZooLockLivesMatter.
I think Grimy Goons have finally given me a paladin deck i want to play.
If i had a few thousand more dust i'd craft a Highlander priest control deck.
But i'd have to make a kazakus a raza and a justicar.
And i don't have that amount of gold.
Til you dont have justicar.
Never opened it.
Keep putting it off because its gong into wild in about 4 months.
Eventually i'll run out of classic cards to get and i'll probably make it because it'll never bad a bad card to own for wild/brawls.
Haha wrathion off malchezaar.
Nice entry animation.
He's also a sort of okay stats plus draw 1 in non dragon decks.
And his first pull was an azure drake so above average card draw p.
Okay someone actually gave my janky astral druid a fair fight at rank 23 wild.
Pirate paladin is apparently a thing.
Smiting for booty.
Malchezaar gave me yogg. I dutifully obliged and played yogg.
Yogg cast astral after which he echoed himself.
One turn later I played yogg again yogg once more cast astral before casting DOOM!
Yogg-Saron is HALPING.
Well I was already kinda ahead in the game against a reno warrior rank 23 and couldnt really be that arsed P.
Actually got kinda close and the astral didn't get rid of the rag lurking the bottom of my deck.
Ok I give up.
I am trying not to go full sneak archer in oblivion but the game is just dead against it. First by making all enemies take 50 hits to kill and then by loot distribution.
Also its traditional.
So far the best sword I have found was just a plain dwarven sword. The best bow I found was called DRAGON BOW.
Oh you managed to find the best bow already.
Well outside of enchanting a good one yourself.
I assume I will find a higher level one later hopefully. currently level...11?
You can find generic +fire damage ones.
But you won't find generic +fire damage aoe's besides that one.
Well now I kind of regret coming to this cave so soon.
Gadget event 6 packs completed opened a 2nd legendary. 2 within 19 packs total seems pretty okay.
Rogue and warrior class ones though =S.
Gadget event 6 packs completed opened a 2nd legendary. 2 within 19 packs total seems pretty okay <- i got two with 90.
Thats pretty okay.
Knuckles and Sergeant Sally.
Got a third one Noggenfogger from my 6 quest packs.
Sorry man =.
I wanted NONE of those.
Crafted wrathion and the jade lotus leader from dust.
Dust is at 800-odd right now but I think I'll do a classics binge before some new stuff comes to mind.
Ok TB on stream is running mill rogue at wild 24.
So now I have a face for all those wankers I meet on ladder. Fucking fantastic.
Now he just lost to a divine spirit inner fire bomb after flaming his opponent.
Thats what you get for playing that deck.
Well that happened.
So I stop to explore a ruin guarded on the outside by a flame atronach.
And as it turns out a summoner.
Well I dismount and start killing those two assholes..Except they are having none of it. Instead they beeline for my armored horsetm and start killing that the poor beast flees and they give chase.
What follows is 5 minutes of me desperately trying to hit the turbosummoner and atronach with my bow in a growing konga line of bullfuckery.
In the end there was the summoner his imp the atronach an angry boar and a FUCKING MINOTAUR murdering my horse because why the fuck not.
Could not save the horse but fuckit not going to reload after that. the horse was cursed.
Never like driding horses in oblivion anyway.
Work xmas party rating hoooooo boy.
Cooked_Auto what even.
Fight bait with ridiculousness.
Or being INFERNO COP.
Oh dear first escort side quest in Dragon's Dogma 10 mins of walking and then a giant wanders into our path and murders the escort in a single blow.
I was not expecting this MoonWolf.
Its so gloriously broken.
Yeah it is.
But here have some World Order.
That sure is some world order.
I'm not sure if this is Rin as a servant or what.
Noelor i have no clue.
Had one of those wonderful encounters with a 'mercy main' in competitive last night.
I wonder why they're stuck in bronze division...
Nothing wrong withsupport players ?
Nah was their attitude.
Flaming everyone despairing at unfair matchmaking that sort of stuff.
Then because they got potg for a quad rez they get to add something to their distorted viewpoint.
Ah yeah those assholes.
Alolan Golem is a railgun for some reason.
Why does this game lack the single console command I need.
It fires rocks charged with electricity. Even if the rock isn't fired that accurately just grazing an opponent will cause numbness and fainting. Because it can't fire boulders at a rapid pace it's been known to seize nearby Geodude and fire them from its back.
Its a pokemon that fires other pokemon as railgun slugs.
Isn't tihs supposed to be a childrens monster collecting game ?
Is it also ginger and a massive tsundere?
I mean as it's ever been.
Misaka was a dirty blonde not a ginger ?
BwaS no it has a beard of iron filing s.
MoonWolf> I dunno man orange-brown hair in anime art I'd describe as ginger...
This wikipedia page claims its officially chestnut.
Which is also the colour of her eyes.
Alright then chestnut.
Although if she had had red hair she would probably have been too much or a Rin expy anyway.
Which Rin you talking about?
The redheaded tsundere one.
I... no clue whats wrong with my brain.
I am watching an archive of a stream of a puzzle game.
This is a frustrating activity.
Is the streamer bad at puzzles ?
But I've noticed a particular solution they haven't yet.
Omg they nearly did it then reset.
Yeah tohsaka was the first rin that came to mind and I was like isn't she dark hair.
There's a Rin in Free! with red hair though...
Is that Rin tsundere though.
Also its Free! so probably a guy.
Yay the pirate snowman got built.
2 yes 1 he kinda is. Pretty brooding and dickish but has his reasons with a side order of good intentions behind them.
Dammit the thing happened again.
They did a thing that showed me the solution but didn't notice themself.
This is the purpose for which time travel will be invented.
Going back to join stream chats and yell at people doing puzzles.
I know i would.
Steven Newniverse was p cute.
Calm the fuck down Jimmy Wales holy shit.
Been to wikipedia lately?
Feels larger than I remember.
It grows every year.
Eventually all of wikipedia will be consumed by the donation header.
This move has way too low PP imo.
One fight only!
MoonWolf my LRT.
I retweeted a different thing now it might help.
Probably not for BwaS.
Well the Nova-only HotS brawl is just as expected. Where soaking in a 3-lane map when down in levels yields you much passive aggressive pinging.
Noelor you are nowhere near the top of my timeline.
This is because I was out last night.
And have pokémon'd all day.
So I'm just at this morning.
Oh you retweeted someone i'm already following so it didn't show.
Tbh it could do with a little more than 4 dudes ?
Why is Crash Bandicoot trending.
Probably because of the playstation experience thing airing right now.
GlennCuttlefish Looks like Yakuza 6 is getting a release in the West.
Oh-ho man gotta love Nova mains. Some of the most toxic cunts in the game.
Oh dear just had a OW competitive game that ended 6v3. Somehow in our favour.
Tch so they said last season ppl placed higher than intended in gold/plat/dia so we're nerfing some of that.
Turns out placing silver one season getting better placement win rate the next lands you bronze with a much reduced MMR.
I knew I was bad at this game but what the ever-loving shite.
Man sure is innovative and exciting when the latest trolden footage is literally what was just up on the subreddit 4 hours ago.
I thought yakuza 6 was confirmed already? If not great news.
I might be thinking of yakuza 0 actually'.
More reasons to hasten getting that PS4.
PS I give up. Time to turn down the difficulty slider in oblivion this combat is such a chore. everything takes 20 hits to kill.
Which is weird since my weapons are seemingly up to date my skills are getting leveled up and my strength is nearly at full.
Whelp turns out blizz decided putting me a division below last season was still an overestimate so they handed over a beautiful loss streak to sweeten the deal.
Its little things like that which would make me drive my fist through my monitor if I ever tried playing ranked.
MoonWolf the latest rageorc.
This is an amazing expansion for strange effects.
MairBear really does have an amazing new set of weird interactions.
Its 13C in my room.
MoonWolf so that was a fun dungeon run.
By Fun I mean I had to spam heal.
What game ?
FFXIV. Reason why it's a 53 dungeon and I realise -now- that I'm still weilding an ilvl 45 tome...
When the average ilevel of my gear is 108.
Go buy a level relevant main weapon MairBear.
You know that thing that more important for healers.
Yeah I have the poetics to just get a 130 one.
Than that rest of their gear.
And if I buy that I will be able to help out by throwing some dps stuff.
Because my shield will not be half a boss-hit.
And not feeling like your are constantly failing.
In all my days asa healer I have not got rid of that feeling.
I have but anytime that happens someone is like LETS PULL MORE THINGS.
MairBear at least you're not raiding EN with a 750 mainhand.
Who would do that.
MoonWolf I don't think people know what Unlicensed Apothecary does.
Two warlocks have played it and flooded the board.
But its fun to see it happen!
I guess they thought it dealt 5 damage to the enemy...?
Maybe they though it was like an imp and would do it to them once.
Instead of for summoning other things.
That seems pretty unambiguous to me.
Well people keep misplaying with it.
So it must not be ?
Also Gangs is not wild.
PatternSpider or Hearthhead is the question.
I'll fix it later.
Hearthead doesn't keep track of that.
PS does that manually.
I needed to update the GANGS into MSG anyway.
Since thats what people are apparantly using.
Is that your Robobrode?
I'm confused what you are confused about.
What msg is in this context.
Mean Streets of Gadgetzan.
I abreviated it Gangs.
But everyone seems to have gone for MSG.
Which is boring but whatever.
Also they were all about the Kabal Jade Lotus and Grimy Goons.
But it turns out the Actual tribes for this expansion were actually Pirates and Jade Golems.
Pirates is probably my favourite tribe so p ok with that.
!hs jade golem.
Sorry but the new Hearthead doesn't let me put search conditions in the url.
Its all fancy ajax stuff now damn them.
Also that's not a Card.
It's a token.
But its a very important token because of how it works.
Because every time you summon one of those tokens it goes up +1/+1.
Your first jade golem is a 1/1.
Your 20'th jade golem is a 20/20.
And jade idol means druids NEVER RUN OUT.
I'm sure hearthhead used to show tokens.
Yeah just turn off collecti ble.
!hs Jade Spirit.
Makes all the WoW pandaria spirit noises.
And its adorable.
Also wow this site is garbage now wtd.
Damnit hearthead you did not clean that string up properly.
Another thing to fix then.
MoonWolf I don't know if this will actually interest you but I've started listening to a podcast called the Spoony Bard's Aural Theatre.
It's a radio play LP of FFIV.
Oh that spoony bard.
I might give it a listen at some point when i'm playing something grindy.
Whats the backlog like ?
I listened through it in the last week.
Mainly on commute.
Bookmakred for later.
GlennCuttlefish halp. Why do rotations say to spend the Thunder procs on Thunder 2.
Never thunder 3.
Dunno. they nmight just be wrong?
I remember T3 being recommended on procs maybe they changed something.
Which guides you looking at?
Pre 3.0 ones.
Cos I'm only 35 or something.
Might be they changed something in how the spell works at some point.
But when you were playing last Thunder 3 was the way to go?
I can never remember how british a thing this is.
But I just got back from visiting my parents for the first time in December.
So have returned with an advent calendar.
Its not exclusivly british.
I might rank a selection box above that for later in the month.
Selection box ?
An assortment of single smaller size chocolate bars under the umbrella of one corp boxed up.
See that is pretty british ithink.
MoonWolf more the fact that I'm 27 and living in my own flat but that does not change the fact that it's December and therefore my mother has bought me 24 tiny chocolates.
Well she is your mom and she gets to buy you 24 tiny chocolates even if you are 70.
Oh so you didn't get one of the ones with the bonus for 25th. stingy p.
It's that part of it I wasn't sure of the cultural distribution of.
BwaS 24 tiny chocolates does not exclude one non-tiny chocolate on day 25.
Ah-ha fair play.
But no Momlor gets 24-day calendars and then a chocolate orange on the 25th.
Ofcourse as a benefit of being 27 and having your own flat you could just eat all the tiny chocolates now.
What sort of monster do you take me for?
One who likes chocolate ?
Man I want a chocolate calendar.
Watching the pokémoon anime.
Ash caught Rowlett by having a comfortable backpack for Rowlett to sleep in.
Ash you are the worst pokemon trainer.
Can't even catch pokemon right.
Finland doesn't have chocolate advent calendars?
In this series Team Rocket no longer blast off again.
Instead they get Tuxedo Mask'd by a specific Bewear who seems to have adopted them.
Not even worth watching.
In episode 5 it ran across the surface of the sea to catch them before running away.
Is that that pink care bear?
Close enough.
Yeah that's the one.
There was some shifty clip going around of its shenanigans with rocket with selective pixellations.
Y'know sometimes I wonder if maybe the HS ladder is upside down.
Maybe even a plateau or like some 'valley' shape.
Going from golden portrait warlock to full on control warrior at rank 20.
Well its the 4th of the month.
You don't reset from legend to 23 in one season though.
What is wrong with this world.
I've found the source of some kind of super poison collected grass only in another dimention murdered a super vampire BUT I CANT FIND A FEW PIECES OF GARLIC.
An unlistable infinity of things.
But also a farlic famine sure.
Farlic being food for garlics.
Jeez 40 credits from another legendary and all my loot boxes keep dropping non-duplicates.
And not the good kind!
Sick of getting reinhardts who only see themselves as a hold down right click and do fuck all else.
News flash you have a fuck off massive hammer that loves to meet red team faces.
MoonWolf more flaps somehow.
Casnorf was finally bothered about it enough I guess.
I honestly thought it was dead.
In this update Fae learns not to joke about Cubivore.
Something that only eats squares?
You have done admirably in putting down this pauses for a beat fowl menace. -Warden NPC when I clear a world quest involving swarming birds.
Met Emily's parents yesterday. To the best of my knowledge I made a good impression.
Oo good good.
According to her sister I sound very scottish sometimes difficult to understand.
Which is great because earlier in the evening at an engagement drinks thing someone thought I sounded irish.
Very scottish sometimes difficult to understand not wrong.
Anathema I was told I sound Australian.
And I'm still very confused.
South African and Australian accents are similar >_>.
Weeeeeeeeell.. yes and no.
Anathema I say less 'cunt'.
Ok I take that back immediately.
Anathema let's just agree that I mix all varieties of English and we're cool.
!hs Jade Spirit.
Noelor fixed the HS cards mostly.
In PS that is.
Can't do much about this.
!hs Jade Spirit.
I have no clue why they include the same text twice.
So I started a new game of Stellaris at the weekend bought the Leviathan's expansion.
I'm fanatically militarist but so far haven't had a single war I keep losing fleets to space pirates the system next to my home world has 16k worth of pirate fleets...
The only Leviathan I've met was a giant perfect sphere that was scanning a black hole I hacked its memory and it told me to gtfo.
I need a good war I've run out of suitable planets to colonize terraforming is /expensive/ and takes ages.
Oh there's a new patch today too.
Anathema I had a few games last night in Overwatch where Geoff was basically screaming 'no more snipers'.
I think he has a thing.
But I shared his pain.
If I play tonight I'll stick to Ana.
Noelor this whole ulti-mate female vore thing making you restart all the time is a bit weird.
Anathema he'll love you for sure.
Okay forget anything i ever said about FF XV.
I need this to be out on pc.
Because apparantly you play a lancer and you get to fight a mountain sized turtle.
Not even joking about mountain sized turtle.
Its got a landscape accurate hill on its back.
!weather the himalayas.
Nice weather over there.
Emily is trying to convince someone to take her there in April.
Anathema for hiking or just for the sights?
Allegedly for her research really so she can see the sights p.
Why else would you go there?
Chill with the Tibetan monks?
I gues if you are so inclined.
I might need to buy a classical guitar.
MoonWolf fyi I still have Cubivore's shitty trumpets stuck in my head.
Minister what about cubivores weird ulti-mate vore thing though ?
That's a thing also.
Something that only eats squares? <- no MairBear a cubivore is a weird dog.
Sometimes a very weird dog.
With a a variety of flaps.
A variable number of flaps even.
It's definitely that.
MairBear its perfectly natural.
My bus bug finally evolved into a Vic Viper bug \o/.
Does it get options ?
> big time racketeer.
It did flip its attack stat priority though.
BwaS Noelor don't forget to pick up the free Meloetta.
Another internet mystery gift instead of the store based code.
Loot box finally drops some credits and I can finally get the valkyr mercy ^^.
Went to the gym this morning.
My body was not prepared.
How bad is it ?
I was struggling to drink my tea.
I do not want to be you tomorrow morning.
Anathema sounds rough!
Yeah thats about right.
Ftrbzzs are you on holiday today?
I can't believe it still exists.
I'm so scared dude.
Worried it will ruin your career prospects? P.
Nice Studio Trigger is making an intro for Indivisible.
I just hope indivisible turns out good. The demo was promising.
Damn it's even directed by the guy who did Little Witch Academia.
<- d.va stole my goggles features overwatch characers kissing for those work inclined persons.
Well only 2 out of 3 couples at least.
Speaking of lesbians. Yes it's safe.
I feel sorry for PatternSpider sometimes the amount of crazy links they have to read out straight-faced.
PatternSpider don't care.
I am not sure how I feel about that quest.
On one ahnd that was the easiest heist of my life.
On the other hand the thiefs guild just sent me to steal a staff from myself.
Right after I burn all my dust on a mercy skin.
Hey that mercy skin is for life.
Until valhalla even.
Anathema Oh my fucking god. They've done it.
Ohhh right now I get it.
I thought it looked odd/familiar like it was a 'is that an over-conversion of some existing SM pose or something?'.
But no ye olde codex art.
Epcot's giant golf ball finally does something useful.
<- say what you will have about warhammer it does have an impressive skulls/inch ratio.
Warhammer we're so into skulls we prefer them to breasts now.
TWEWY is the touching story of a young boy chugging huge amounts of ice cream so he'll fit into a skirt.
I have never done that.
Unless this is a hint.
Is this is a hint MairBear.
Do i need to kill everyone ?
I mean unless that death is actually Krysat in disguise no.
You have whoops'd people before. Well. Noelor.
It was a crit!
I have also repeatedly Amost whoops'd people.
But then Noelor has bullshit characters.
With retroactive damage shields.
True art.
Well it is the front cover of pathfinder that's a flippin da vinci right there.
Another week of hosting mythic+ runs another round of 'everyone else gets the lootses host gets token artifact power'.
Really don't know why I bother.
For a headline feature of this expac truly falling flat on its face in implementation and experience.
And don't even get me started on Kara2han.
MoonWolf wow this expansion allows some agro bullshit let me tell you. xD.
Opponent rogue goes first plays small-time buccaneer. Gets the charging 1/1 too.
Next turn weapons up preps coldbloods on the buccaneer.
I still draw nothing to kill it. Rogue's turn punch in face conceal eviscerate.
A pair of 1 mana cards and a hero power taking me down to 4 hp by turn 4.
Lots of taunt.
I put weapons in this pirate weapon deck.
I have had 5 games without drawing one.
You should believe in the heart of the cards more.
Clearly you don't.
Rerolled rogue quest for 40g.
Get 100g quest play 75 murlocs.
Cos now I have to play a murloc deck.
Murlocs are fun.
Or just play 75 warrior games.
As I have a finley.
Lemme just light this match ON MY TONGUE.
Cooked_Auto wait what is that a model you can now buy!?
Holy fuck I want that model.
Lemme just light this match ON MY TONGUE <- and a thousand yuri ships took a turn for the worse.
Or better if you're into that sort of thing.
Also she has the classical pomf on the bed sound effect.
Meanwhile in Poppyu I can relate to friedrich.
No not really.
You frequently get exposed to unwanted metal ?
The guy in my RPG group I usually get lifts from to wherever we are playing.
In all the years I've been hitching rides there have been exactly 2 albums in his car.
That'd get sort of old.
And this why I dont like that one sabaton album.
Anathema yes.
Game footage is identifiably oni storyline seems very advanced.
As in timeskipped quite far.
MoonWolf dunno if I said but Lets Play 13th Age finished a month or so back.
They're putting up Microscope sessions as an interlude.
I've gotten that from twitter retweets.
Currently watching the first episode of the lp of magic knight rayearth.
It is exceedingly anime.
Also it seems somewhat.... sailor moonish.
It's definitely a 90s mahou shojou.
Just make short haired girls hair colour blue and give her glassses and she's basically ami.
Oh she has glasses.
Basically ami without the blue hair.
*remove her glasses.
Ami doesn't have glasses.
She has magic goggles from R are so yes.
Blue haired girl isn't really into fire but turn her hair black and you've got rei.
At least hikaru isn't at all like usagi.
Umi is water Rei and Fuu is wind Ami though yes.
Everyone involved seems suprisngly okay with the fact that they've just kidnapped 3 teenagers.
Again it's the 90s.
Pretty much business as usual.
Oh no clef go turned to stone.
Nevermind he can narrate at us telepathically anyway.
Wouldn't want to get too much gameplay in the first 45 minute sof game.
There is a new non-default dx11 renderer in the latest PoE patch.
Its something alright.
Anathema whats the cloak supposed to do ?
Not that dunno what else p.
Today in non terrible news commision concludes parental rights law should over overhauled for modern society.
Allowing for gay marriage more than 2 parental units etc.
Surrogate mother and actual mother divorced parents with a new partner etc.
2 gay men with a surrogat emother was called out too.
I don't know what that means Noelor.
That involves more characters than i'd have guessed.
It was the bit I could remember sufficiently to google of Tsukini Kawatte Oshioki yo 月に代わっておしおきよ.
Are you forgetting that Japanese chiefly uses a syllabary?
I figued punish/punishment would have been its own kanji.
It's the verb in the sentence so not so much.
Verbs actually conjugate a bit in Japanese.
With their alphabets the way they are.
Though also directly plugging punish into google translate does just give the kanji for punishment followed by verbing articles.
So fuck knows.
Mairnai what is your opinion on the arrangement of Japanese writing systems?
With regards to conjugating.
Incidentally google translate returns Punishment on behalf of the moon for the moonrune version of that sentence which is mostly kana with a couple kanji.
You wot m8?
But if given the same sentence in romanji returns.
つきに かわって おしおき よ.
Fuck it on your behalf.
Thanks for the formatting google.
Thank you sailor moon for associating punishment with the moon.
I mean the sentence is literally her catchphrase.
She does love punishing things and or people in the name of the moon.
At the drop of a hat.
It's sort of her deal.
Are evil emotion monsters people ?
Depends on the series.
Looks like my isp and mmoirc have come to an understanding again regarding my being connected.
Microscope and/or the 6 Feats Under crew is/are weird.
MoonWolf same though.
Oh PatternSpider's dutch again or I just noticed it being dutch for this first time in a while?
How is PatternSpider dutch again ?
I blame google.
It should be telling the internet its english.
Maybe it never stopped being dutch and I just stopped noticing.
I have done everything reasonable to let the internet know PatternSpider really likes things in english.
Did you... feed it the script of Serenity or has it just been around people quoting it?
It has no scripts in it at this point in time.
Just 3 MB of this channel.
The Fairy-type Z-move is called Twinkle Tackle.
MoonWolf remember the other day I was mad at a streamer not getting puzzles?
She's put up an editted mini-LP of that game.
With all the missing th epuzzles cut out ?
I think she re-recorded.
But yes editted so the puzzles are immediately solved.
Also subtitled for extra soothing it's a soothing game.
The trainer dance for Twinkle Tackles consists of making a finger-heart then flouncing.
Always an astounding lack of counterpicking by blue team in the 3v3 mode.
Try being red team.
Impossible can never be red team.
Hah this time i managed to stay connected.
Noelor pls no explode.
Noelor ?
Noelor I'm getting the distinct impression that Alolans like Rockruffs. A lot.
Was listening to Mr Mrs Ironicus' podcast on the way in this week about The Sound of Music.
It's 9AM you should be brighter than 8 am. Not even more overcast.
They were singing Edelweiss as I switched it off so it was stuck in my head... but I don't actually know it so what's actually stuck in my head now is Aeris' Theme???
Kirisu good enough!
Kirisu one song to the tune of another etc?
MoonWolf how many rivendare + weasels will we see this brawl? P.
MairBear i saw none actually.
I played a feign death hunter.
That was fun whenver i actually got feign death in my hand.
Kirisu a better song tbh.
MairBear I'd need to know Edelweiss' words-jam in order to spread it into the tune-scone of Aegis' theme.
Aegis is a different JRPG waifu.
Best robot waifu.
I was going to say different Best Girl.
But honestly not sure between Aerith and Tifa.
Whereas Aegis is definitely the Best Personarer I will fight you.
I'm not sure about best all around.
Dog whose name I can't spell rn is close competition.
I'd like to point out you are biased towards not quite human things that are human now.
You probably love teddy too.
That's a bit extreme.
Also I still haven't consumed P4 so we're clear.
It does not have anyone quite as interesting on that level as Aegis.
I didn't think so.
The theming of p4 is very different a lot of its more about what the world expects of you vs what you want to do.
All I really know about P4 is that it is to P3 as JoJo 4 is to JoJo 3.
I don't know what that means since i don't actually watch jojo.
I experience purely through osmosis.
To me at least P3 the personal stories seem to be a lot about Who I Am vs Who I Pretend To Be.
While P4 is all about Who I Am vs What the World Expects of me.
MoonWolf url for bonsai?
Forgot to save before picking my starter thought I did but nope I am now back to the very start of Moon.
Odd. everybody is suddenly rude to me in oblivion.
How dare they.
I know right? I am the hero after all they should worship the ground beneath my feet.
Yeaaah the lack of save spot after all these cutscenes I'm just gonna accpt the starter they give me as it is.
Not going to fish for the best possible starter ?
MairBear take Popplio tbh.
Minister I totes will.
As awesome as rowlett is....
There are many strong options for grass type this game.
I'll try and get a rowlett early on through trade or whatevs.
I don't actually know how to trade with someone specific online.
Kara no Kyoukai episode 3 the arguably a serial killer protagonist is angry with the chapters antagonist because she keeps turning off her being a terrible supernatural killer attitude before the protagonist can get in a good life or death fight with her. this is not a comedy show.
Skiki Ryogi even more ridiculous than skihi tohno.
She just stabbed someones being sick to death.
Just that they were sick.
Still left a stab wound though.
MoonWolf oh hell no nothing comedy to be had.
Just absolutely gorgeous art and presentatiion.
Oh yeah this stuff is great.
I wished i watched it earlier.
Its also actually adult.
Instead of adult.
I think i watched 5 or so of them and know I'm missing a few.
I have 8.
Please tell me your versions have the little turn off your phone intros.
I don't think so anyway.
Just some credits about the producers and animation company the logo title of the chapter.
Those things were amazing.
Here's one.
Yeah definitly none of those.
Why is neko-arc in there.
Same reason Rin is in some of the later ones I guess.
But this is not the same universe.
So I finally got around to seeing Doctor Strange.
I now get why everyone on the net has been yelling about bargains the past month or so.
I'm still waiting for a decent piratable version of that to show up.
🌙🐺 he heres?
Really wish i could have emoji as my nickname on irc.
I wanna find a better way of producing emoji on my pc tbh.
Route 1 has a lot of pokes.
Alas my ride is going to be about 50 mins late for my class. so it looks like I'm not making it. Silver lining I can press on to a place of trading in pokemon.
Speaking of trading what is this nonsense. No pokemon bank till Jan for S/M?
MairBear yeah I was sad.
But it's fair imo.
You're not starting a new gen with a beefed up party from the previous or w/e.
Otoh it's only a month or so delay.
Just means to be on the safe side I'll be using alolan pokemons in 5/6 slots.
I've managed 6/6.
At least *.
Got there... midway through the 2nd isle I think.
But getting a balanced team with that caveat with only one starter is easiest with Popplio imo but that's probably just because I dislike fish.
Can you get into Festival Plaza yet?
Not yet. Slacking and poking corners and also getting afk'd. Did you also go for popplio?
So far mine's definitely winning on the '3'.
No I took Rowlett.
Regretted it from approx the point I had a party full of Alolans.
Though not enough to restart.
I did get a Popplio the other day though got the second stage on GTS for a Shellder of all things.
What on earth.
Is this hellish abomination before me.
It was a Grubbin.
It evolves into a bus.
And a whole game later a jet.
It starts uite aberrational.
I think it's cute I.
Maybe it's the wiggly bits that put me off somehow.
I will admit at the time I said that it was small and distant from the camera.
I didn't know it had eyes till I caught it.
MairBear the music for kara no kyoukai is .hack / see-saw ish but i'm not seeing them in the credits at all.
Its done by one of see-saw.
Did they really just do Fate's Gilgameshes Gates of Babylon but for butt combat ?
Of course they did.
Weird thing i've noticed in kara no kyoukai.
The animators actually know women come in bodytypes different than young girl teenager adult old lady.
Yeah there was just a random nurse on screen who could be described as heayv set.
And it was just a random background character.
Are you sure it's anime?
It looks a lot like anime.
Its written by Nasu.
Actually the Please Tell Me Galko-chan had a surprising number of different female body types.
Pretty good SOL series too.
Tonight I did enough Battles Royal to get my first Power Item \o/.
Which one ?
The speed one.
Seems the most broadly applicable.
Shouldn't take me too long to get more they're not too expensive as compared to the difficulty of getting battle currency this time round.
Going first is almost always good.
Exceptions exist but are Very Specific yes.
Every time I calculate that my pokemon can take 1 more hit.
The enemy criticals.
<- mairbear right now.
Me in XCOM.
Also Fire Emblem also Hearthstone also...
You all the time.
MairBear Pokémon Refresh is very powerful btw.
Visit the café in the left corner of the centre every day for beans and stuff them in your mons' mouths 3 beans is enough for them to be full.
Then rub them 'til they sing.
Tried and tested method for making your pkmn love you.
Which provides bonuses.
Such as increase xp and crit chance and a free Focus Sash effect.
Man friendship is getting OP.
Doesn't work in MP.
Probably also not Tree.
The post-game battle tower thing is a tree.
Because reasons I assume.
Well don't rub them in the wrong spot.
I mean its already being some pretty sillly things.
Why not a tree.
Or they get sad eyes.
Oh man you get to beat up your choice of red or blue.
Yeah it was in some of the promo stuff.
Red speaks in ellipses I believe.
But anime red can talk.
Origins Red spoke but not Generations Red.
Main anime is Ash not Red.
Ash != Red.
I could have sworn the short anime about Red they did he talked.
Which was literally just the plot of RGB.
Those were my last 4 balls C.
Rip your balls.
I don't think I've ever run out in this game.
Another dota major another iteration of me watching it like the clueless hots scrub I am.
Just look at the pretty explosions.
The range of engage and everything flinging from all the way across the screen makes it like everyone is flipping Chromie.
Personally i'd say that HOTS is the game that features very small engagement ranges even for casters.
Also hots on the whole is nto nearly as bursty.
And individual skills can't swing a fight nearly as much.
Yeah you should have seen the tyrande-diablo-raynor meta P.
<< yep I spent one saturnalia morning 3 years ago spamming delibirds out into the aether.
Did you breed a ton beforehand or something ?
Yeh there was a heads up beforehand.
Got like a max IV Sneasel out of it named Santa Claws from someone doing the same.
Episode 10 maybe we will finally get some actual plot exposition.
Hey things are actually happening outside of pure illusion now.
I've started chucking a Mareanie and a Popplio onto WT each night.
Just because I bred a bunch.
Sweet jesu! PLOT!
Wait do you mean plot-plot or plot.
Well technically backstory.
Get you an anime who can do both?
Well theres not much plot to begin with.
Oh cool tonight's Popplio netted me a Drampa.
Its quite storyboarded to begin with.
Drampa is the Dragon Grampa.
Oh boy oh boy I cant wait for that one plot point I precit to come true.
HERE WE GO.
It's been such a long time coming / I'd thought you'd understand?
Oh boy oh boy I cant wait for the next episodes.
Well the main character found out whats going on. Most of the theories seemed to be pretty spot on.
As an example of how little I use sublime text on my desktop it is still filled with Exalted notes from Noelor's game.
I use mine all the time.
10 years to prepare for war that's when my current truce expires.
With.. whom ?
The koala people who stole my planet.
One of the planets I have an observation post around started X-COM in response to my research on them.
Anathema send in the thin-men!
I have D.
They will be annexed.
Dear god.
I did not see that chorus coming.
It was clearly death MoonWolf.
That still says he heres.
I reget not finding this channel before today.
MairBear fyi the Heart Scale move reminder this gen is hidden away at the top of victory road.
That seems a bit bullshit.
Right at the end of the game.
Minister I unlocked the tradey place btw.
K bug me tonight.
Probs on mumb.
What should I develop a backlog of?
Evolvestone equiped eevees.
He won't be that far.
MairBear if you've managed to catch a Pikachu I'll love you a lot.
But otherwise just catch some Rattata or whatever.
You're on 🌙 right?
I am not a lego brick no.
It was a moon emoji.
Yes I'm playing ムーン.
I don't think I'd realised that was a long u.
I'm just going to assume that was chinese for moon and MairBear spelled out tsuki in japanese.
That makes more sense than tsuuki.
Though btw you have emoji font installed but nothing for moonrunes?
I have no moji.
So we're just a mirror!
What *are* you hiding MairBear?
Though btw you have emoji font installed but nothing for moonrunes? <- i have all of them but i can't comprehend chinese or japanese and i have not memorized the japanese for moon.
Kirisu also my dad was going over accounts.
I don't have hanzi installed on my phone any more.
And we spent money at sanshainshiti.
Which is to say the pokemon store at Sunshine City.
Took me ages to parse it.
Cos it was a large lump sum and mysterious to us.
Was there Steven Universe this week?
Turns out today is day of indecisions. cant figure out what to listen or what to draw.
Yeah but do you draw a crotchet or a semibreve?
I have no clue what that is.
Like a keytar but instead of keys is a sax.
Is this a real thing that exists ?
Actually probably not.
Good.
Closest I can think of is a melodica.
That's a keytar with a sax vaguely instead of the 'tar.
Extremely vaguely. its more a keypad with a wind pipe.
Does the pipe have a reed?
A very perfunctory Google led me to believe so.
Also the sound of it tbh.
Well that was not what I had expected from this.
Hmm turns out when you pick Li Ming in Heroes Brawl when red team goes Kerrigan x2 Butcher Tyrael shit gets crazy fast D.
You mean you get murdered a lot ?
Well in this case no.
Despite the dive comp we got a bit of a front line with our draft so it was poke unload get the kills get the reset unload everything and chain the aoe.
I dont get it. for some reason overwatch just runs worse on a slightly more powerful card.
Which is not helping with the anger issue.
Could be that the CPU is now acting like a bottleneck because the card is better. I dunno.
Why the dicks is *DotA 2* on SteamVR?
Also why is it in my library?
They made a VR observer mode.
And since dota2 is free everyone got it.
I'm not entirely sure observer mode makes much more sense for VR.
Steam is pushing VR pretty hard.
They had to have a title with vr in they actually owned.
They made it dota.
However you can't play it in VR.
Because that just doesn't work.
Now I have Hey Jude stuck in my head.
Congratulations you know German.
A little bit.
Might be the same in dutch actually?
I forget how y'all multiple.
We like putting en at the end of things to multiple.
Also I was extolling the virtues of rubbing your pokémon earlier.
And putting beans in them.
Turns out legendary pokémon are much harder to make love you than regular ones!
This data-mined Z-move has some weird repercussions.
Sorry not sorry Noelor.
Still no pichu c.
Pikachu wearing a cap. lol.
MairBear not to worry.
Also 10 megavolts is a lot of electromotive force.
Not like I can't get it off Bank next year.
It's like a thousand times the transmission voltage of the electricity network.
BwaS tbf though Pigeot flies at mach 2.
Also my DS clock is wrong.
So only one rattata.
Yungoos also fine =P.
Anything does if you put a thousand times the transmission voltage of the electricity network through it!
What's another dumb number.
Where do we start...
Flareon's breath is 3000 C.
No wait F.
Only 1700 C.
Magcargo's body temp 10000 C.
Anyway I'm going to go get some food hopefully it will be cooler than a Flareon.
Then I'll jump on mumb for pokéchat.
I dont understand it.
Theres free kills right there.
Why will none of my teammates go reaper and take them.
Who needs reapin'?
Good news one of my local friends engages in my favourite holiday season tradition.
Arguing about whether or not Die Hard is a xmas movie.
Noelor was a concensus reached ?
Of course not.
That's not the point.
So what positions do you and your friend hold?
I swear this weeks SC2 not a brawl is impossible to 80% of the player base.
What is it ?
Chain of ascension map. Except all the enemies have about triple normal move speed. Extra attack speed. COnstantly spam infested at your base. AND every unit even hybrids heal to full the first time you kill them.
A match against Zest while he's asleep at the keyboard.
Do you still get the hero units ?
You still get your full toolkit yeah.
Well it'd be doable.
But its still bullshit.
Which map was chain of ascension?
Totally doable. Just not to a bronze player like myself.
The protoss base defense from heart of the swarm.
Naw the one where you have to help the protoss move from your base to the enemies.
Don't remember that one.
The escort map where she's duelling and yelling at you about how you suck and why are your armies not here.
Maybe because of the fucking hybrids calm your tits lady.
I think for me to be able to do it at my current skill.
I need to unlock ALL the things.
But I was playing on Normal right. And at 10 mins or so.
A wave of about 30 marines and 5 medivacs just stormed my base.
So I just got killed.
MairBear I read hybrids as hubris there.
Sentence still worked.
Protoss are fairly hubris.
I'd totally believe it if there was a protoss unit called hubris.
Hubristic is correct.
In protoss hubris news.
I think Alarak is my new fave in HotS.
That the edgy one?
Smug asshole blizzard villain yes.
He's even more asshole and egotistical than Illidan.
His character's fun but his HotS kit is basically 'telekinesis opponent to you discord strike them then fuck off for 10 sec til cooldowns come back as your AA is absolute trash'.
There was a round of the Korean Heroes league last season.
Alarak got picked.
The NA casters both massive SC buffs then got confused of the lore implications of Artanis being on same team.
Casually admitting they hadn't played the end of Legacy campaign.
Noelor need to prod washing machines and throw things at radiators but afterward shall we try and engage in jolly co-operation?
Sure I'm on mumb for whenever.
Ultra-fucking typical. Overwatch client crashes on that rare moment Blue Team starts progressing on a capture map.
So it has that detection now. cute.
Really sick of those who drop 222 in the chat like they're some masters of an unheard of formation.
You're not MVP Black who's just figured out double warrior comp is effective.
Story of my fucking life right here. Dva drops her ult I Mercy-leap to the Rein with his shield up. Rein then drops shield at last second to shift slightly behind a corner.
You overshoot and die.
No I'd got to his position initially halfway through the timer then he dropped shield and moved off while I was still in blast LoS.
Win a classic pack every week in Tavern Brawl during the launch celebration! - TB isn't launched yet?
Ah dear me. Poor warrior opponent Moat Lurker'd my Spawn of N'zoth.
Thereby buffing my minion to a 4/4 and letting me clear it to get 2 more.
Oh yeah moat lurker is great in this brawl.
On your own minions.
You get two triggers then it dies and it brings back two more.
Ohhh beautiful enemy puts up a flame trap I have 4 minions on board one is another Spawn.
I play 2 reincarnates on the spawn. Then attack.
I mean he wanted to proc my tentacle for his own rattles. But instead gave me 8/7 loot hoarder 6/8 nerubian egg 7/7 tentacle of nzoth.
And with deathrattle quest done time to grind wild-ranked as a murloc shaman to clear these other quests.
Really wish HS packs worked like Gwent packs.
Its still the same 5 card pack one rare or better guarenteed.
But instead the guarenteed rare or better is a pick 1 of three all the same quality.
Which makes it a little easier to get the cards you actually need for your deck/faction of choice.
Or to avoid really bad legendaries.
Lost to a heal paladin who was 1 turn off lethal 4 turns in a row.
Positive side I got a lot of murlocs played in one game!
You did it.
I sure did.
Well.. that uh..
That wild hunter had millhouse... in his deck.
Must be a gimmick deck.
Which meant my warleader and 4 razorfins got a free bloodlust and win.
I swear to gods when I become the omniruler of the multiverse I will create hands that are flat and easy to draw.
Start developing mind powers.
Mind powers are easy compared to this bullshit.
You need a degree in quantum physics or something to truly understand where do all the bits properly go.
Fishing is p bullshit in this game.
As is traditional for fishing in games.
Confusing my window cleaner with WoW on one screen DotA on the other in my study 3.
Something newspeak out of France pledging to extend and maintain emergency powers/martial law in the name of protecting democracy.
<< I'd be dead after one map with this.
Ah the good ol' fashioned full team wipe with multiple level lead all keeps down Sonya and Illidan in the comp and everyone runs scared from killing the core.
Also the good ol' warhead junction what do you mean the nukes aren't just for hoarding for core damage?
Man internet asks for weird things.
Well at least I have now joined the sad group of people making steven universe fanart.
Someone asked amethyst making that face.
You are now officially an artfag.
...Deleted a bunch of anime since I saw those episodes.
Go download more.
Realize I never memorized the series name.
Internet history to the rescue.
MairBear Kara no Kyoukai 5 because linear storytelling is too sensible lets jump backwards and forwards between scenes a lot.
Lol shiki asctually has 3 identical 3 leather jackets.
Fuck me why is target the healer still a completely alien concept.
Unless it's the enemy.
Deep in her depression at her sort of not quite boyfriend being gone for a while Shiki gets herself a fucking katana.
Because she wasn't quite scary enough with a knife.
Took me 5 hours to get 2 wins in pvp. And then my brother wonders why I hate it so.
Jeepers were they all garden of terror/dragon shire games?
MairBear that doesn't seem worth it.
And indeed but its this or pvp arena.
Of course every game was a one sided shut out.
One against an all cyrillic named team in AV that decided the path to victory was to grind it out.
As in use all 600 reinforcements.
In that time we got a total of 80 kills.
Oh one of those matches hate those.
I got the BG world event quest fairly quick as it rolled IoC several times.
Yeah my brother hates IoC for ... reasons.
So it was exempt for a while until we got 5 AVs in 6 queues then we swapped it for IoC on the ban list.
Our other being silvershard cos f that place.
Damn I forgot to eat again and now it is late.
Silvershard has been vetoed ever since I got the obligatory win for the MoP legendary chain.
I just do not understand that place at all.
2 horde on one cart 2 horde on another trhe rest in a death ball on the third.
And yet we still can't wrest control of the 2 lones ones because tank-class + healer. on each.
6 is starting off cute and upbeat.
This can only mean the tragedy and gore is goign to peak beyond 5.
Thats it we've reach the point where a girl going i'm in love with my older brother which i know is incest and i don't give a fuck.
Is somehow less creepy than half the fucking shows out there with sort of not equite pretend incest.
This can only mean the tragedy and gore is goign to peak beyond 5 <- i was wrong nobody even lost any limbs.
Match point on the dotas they're 1h15m into the map 52 kills to 54.
Really gotten stupid.
Tournament point even.
Someone made a rapier which is apparently a big thing and it's already traded sides twice.
Green team despite killing all of orange team's keeps did a very poor job of right clicking the core.
But they finally figured it out.
Wasn't it going to be bara on fire ?
Was made to watch an episode of Keijo last night.
It was almost exactly as expected.
MoonWolf I ended up on this page.
And apparently the Grail Wars didn't happen in chronological order now.
Also the sentence Leonardo da Vinci a female acts as the shopkeeper.
Nasuverse yes this random historical figure was also a woman.
Don 't ask why.
Just accept this fact.
See also Francis Drake.
Somehow the sixth war is in the past now.
Even though i'm pretty sure it was in fact in fate hollow ateraxia.
Unless thats no longer cannon.
Oh its an alternate timeline.
Fucking typical mages fucking with time.
The main story consists of seven chapters and seven stages of humanity's history. It is part of a branching world resulting from a timeline split from before Clock Tower 2015 due to the actions of Lev Reinol Flauros.
Yeah I saw that.
Not sure how alternate timeline means the third war happened before the first.
Berserker's True Name is Florence Nightingale uh.
Caster's True Name is Thomas Alva Edison see that sounds reasonable.
Due to his unique summoning Caster's body is different from how he was in life and his proportions differ from historical records you don't say.
For some reason I expected tits not a lion.
CookedAuto that's a perfectly reasonable reaction tbh.
Noelor did someone summon him into a you figure wtf.
I mean its Fate after all so.
MoonWolf idk it doesn't say.
His NP's pretty rad though.
Eroding people's faith in mysteries to nothing it is a “World Faith Plundering” Anti-Populace Noble Phantasm.
At this point i'm expecting the next Fate game/story to be all about how actually the very first holy grail was back in king arthurias time where she summoned mozes into the body of a 12 year old girl and he sticks around afterwards to be merlin.
Well Camelot is one of the wars in FGO.
Nasu preempts even my most ridiculous ideas.
Because we've also had actaully it was in the matrix all along too.
That one was also ON THE MOON.
And the servants are a Saber from Camelot a Caster from China and Archer from Persia.
And three Assassins.
All of them Hassan.
They all always are.
All Hassan's are very bishie.
Only some of them.
MoonWolf they are the only Hassan Assasins listed here.
And they're all in the same war.
Technically its only supposed to summons Hassan-il something or others since it only summons people who were head of the order of assassins and they all took that name.
But the videogames with tons of servants sort of throw everything off.
I know in one of them there is a kiritsugu.
You'd think he'd be a caster.
As in Shirou's stepdad?
I can see Assassin.
How does he even quality for heroic spirit though.
He's not fucking famous.
His personality is close to how he was when he was a young man.
He's just that guy that murdered a ton of people during the 4th grail war.
Although he was an assassin who killed many people his existence is not engraved in the Throne of Heroes. He is one of the “imitation Heroic Spirits” referred to as Counter Guardians.
Bullshit nasu made up later to justify it.
It's extant bullshit.
That he'd made up to justify Shirou's HS status as well.
Shirou was a counter guardian but he was still famous in his own right in the future.
Which is why he was available as a heroic spirit.
Because the root/akashic records exist outside of time.
Well also I think it's an alternate timeline's Kiritsugu.
Anyway I also found this servant.
An Assassin who is Artoria sick of all these fractal versions of Artoria being summoned so she's here to get rid of them.
A very serious character.
FGO also summons the Kaleid version of Illya as a caster and her clone as an archer.
Does it summon any shiki's.
I'm not particular on which kind or mental version of them.
Any shiki's at all ?
Ryougi as both Saber and Assassin.
Guess they decided to skip out on the shiki tohno's since he's a little weaksauce compared to ryougi.
A more mature version of Gilgamesh shows up as a caster.
Anyway I finally found the servant I was actually looking for.
Archer's True Name is Ishtar イシュタル Ishutaru? a Pseudo-Servant summoned into the body of Rin Tohsaka.
The fuck are you doing Rin.
What the fuck are you doing with yourself.
Her weapon-of-choice is the Heavenly Boat Maanna 天舟マアンナ which is both an airship and a giant bow.
Well Gilgamesh already had a jet / flying fortress thing.
So why the fuck not.
Ah yes an excuse to have rin wear less clothing.
Anyway she's been showing up in the trending emails I get from pixiv for like the last month.
Suprised she didn't upgrade with cat ears honestly.
Its hard to take the phone game entries into the fate stay night universe seriously.
I knwo this is ironic considering well.
Its nasu stuff.
Well that was a fun bug. equipped some robes to infiltrate this dungeon.
When I finish it I realize my armors are just gone.
MairBear I didn't actually explain how I got Serperior the other night did I?
Mentioning because I just caught a Cyndaquil.
Ok so for Cyndaquil specifically can you get to Route 3 yet?
Sadly that is where they live today.
And... areas beyond that through Wednesday.
Aaanyway once you've completed the first island or it's Thursday there's a QR scanner on your X menu.
Scan some pokémon you haven't seen yet from this page.
That'll charge up your scanner once it's fully charged you can scan the entire island you're on and it'll tell you hey there's a weird pokémon on this route.
But which pkmn depends on the day of the week.
Find lists on your favourite reference site.
Fun fun fun xD.
MairBear dota 2 removed statups from the game and replaced them with a tiny talent tree and everyone is flipping their SHIT.
What will I pick on that one hero that ignores an ability till 21?
Well you'll have to pick that ability.
Because the talent trees are purely level bound.
You get them even if you don't want too.
Also the site crashed and nwo its only offered in chinese so currently people are trying to get the finicky pathc details from google translated chinese.
Which is glorious.
Yep can confirm.
Am reading dota2 translated from chinese.
Tree is four 2-way options up to the level cap of mostly passive scaling effects.
But no doubt their playerbase will read it as becoming Heroes.
I like that thats the whole thing.
We removed statup on level up and made a slightly more interesting skill tree to replace it.
Dota's level 25 happens a whole lot less than heroes' level 20 also.
And the dota2 community reaction is RIOT VOLVO RIOT.
Volvo riot? v.
Its a sick dota meme.
So is there a saab riot as well?
No volvo is a dumb way to say valve.
But riot's the other moba dev!
Not sure if RIOT as in games or Riot as in table flipping.
Or maybe that's the 'clever' thing.
MairBear apparantly monkey king can disguise himself as a tree.
Instructions unclear flipped ghostcrawler's table.
TIL Dota2 has map hats.
You can buy hats for the level.
Noelor I got a not-yungoose from wonder trade!!! O.
It was a tentacool.
And gave a grimer over for a rowlet.
My point being I have gained more yungoos through WT than I have run across in the actual game.
Such is the nature of Wonder Trade.
Right after 77 hours 517 saves and 34 levels.
Time to start the main quest.
Far too early.
I finally got onto Route 2 v.
MairBear that took you a while.
More reinhardts really need to realise left click does something on their hero.
And not just right click.
MoonWolf nah Route 1 is like 5 routes on the scale of older games.
Yes yes rein very nice barrier but they're wailing on you in melee range and you should really start wailing on them.
THIS IS A THING.
Glenn's next VN?
I mean it seems like it has honest advertising at least.
Aww its smart phone only.
Wait is it f2p.
Must check my phone.
Why would you actually want this GlennCuddlefish.
Because it made me giggle non stop for a minute.
I know there's a racing horse kemonomimi something or other but human heads on horses is a step too far.
See the horse thing wasn't absurd enough.
BwaS thats because horse girls are basically catgirls with marginally different tails and ears.
While tihs is just O_o.
Inorite! And this from someone who completed a route of Pigeon Dating Sim!
Man I still havent got around to that since my friends of are a bunch of judas brutusi and watched it on their own.
Dont you hate that feeling when you are catching up to a series and go check the latest episodes but you already have them.
And then check when it was uploaded and its like 3 hours ago and now you have to wait a week.
Not rly. my crunchy queue is about 10 series right now with most probably got half or more a cour to go.
My crunchy queue was rather short this season to start with and then I ran out of funds to continue my subscription so that wasn't an issue this time.
Good thing anime is easy to borrow from the internet.
As a matter of course Hypno makes anyone it meets fall asleep and has a taste of their dreams. Anyone having a good dream it carries off. oh good.
How does it define good dreams.
The pokédex doesn't say.
Though for Drowzee it says It rarely eats the dreams of adults because children's are much tastier. and It loves fun dreams.
Though also If your nose becomes itchy while you are sleeping it's a sure sign that a Drowzee is standing above your pillow and trying to eat your dream through your nostrils.
Man I love the passive aggressive tanks who spam need healing when the solo support is corpse running...
Man why did nobody tell me killing mythic dawn was so profitable.
Found 2 of the 3 items I've been looking for since level 20 on a single pack.
It's been a long time since I played Oblivion.
Well alright then.
....that bot is getting pretty good.
Nier 2 demo is in about 2 weeks in japan.
Remember they promised it would have a happy ending this time!
Happy end or refund.
So I showed my friends that amethyst drawing and they requested I draw something with sugilite next.
So now I've been stuck trying to figure out how that character is even constructed and on top of that trying to figure out some fabulous enough poses.
I mean I could just look at jojo since araki probably has hand picked the best poses already over the years but.
How many of those are designed for giant woman with 4 arms ?
I mean it is jojo.
The Kickstarter this week that we think is the least likely to be bad a fair award.
It dropped off a seemingly insignificant chest in the outworld while world-questing.
Which was it? O.
To go with.
Alas it is already vanished my friend didn't tell me about it till too late c.
Don't you mulitple space hah me young man.
One game rank 20 is fucking legend rank against golden players.
Another game it's against a warlock who demonfires a wisp.
No I dont understand either.
I wonder what this does.
I guess wisp isn't a demon.
The FF8 is okay and suitably ridiculous until you get to 240 when the fanservice shows up out of context S.
Yeah that was a l ittle jarring.
Also i remember when this was about racing cars.
But now its about shooting cars with tanks and miniguns apparantly.
Has been for a good few of them now.
Well they certainly keep on getting insaner.
Can't blame this necromancer for not being prepared.
She had 30 of both health and mana potions on her.
Wtf was up with that cave I looted 100weight in potions alone.
Its the potion cave.
Never will you have to buy potions again.
Unless potions scale terribly in this game.
In which case free money ?
Twitch jumping the shark again and it's now The US Govt streaming.
I'm writing an essay about AAVE and have continued using African American in place of black to inflate my wordcount.
Something something monster.
Also we had to take a single phrase of our chosen non-standard english variety as a starting point so the actual title of my essay is Ain't Nobody Got Time For That.
Anathema relatedly next week I'm going to write an essay on the Nae Rolls sketch from Burnistoun.
Can I read it once you are done?
I can barely lift my arms again today was amazing.
These two statements do not follow.
There's a good kind of exhaustion.
Also exercise releases the happy hormones.
I have to work a long shift today so in 8 hours I might be singina different tune.
When told nier 2 will have a happy ending PlatinumGame’s game designer Takahisa Taura reacted with a “huh?!” and Square Enix producer Yosuke Saito reacted by saying “from what I’ve seen in the scenario how the heck is it supposed to have a happy ending?! I can’t imagine how”.
We were promised a happy ending!
-to which Yoko responded to the two with “I’m telling you it’ll be a happy ending. You don’t need to look so worried.”.
I mean is this the face of a liar?
I'm no longer worried that yoko taro has promised us a happy ending.
He'd NEVER lie to us.
Today in Poppy the purest expression of love.
Hand holding ?
A hand is involved and what it is doing is holding.
Fast adoraball special.
Day 2 Trying to draw sugilite is terrible. at this point I am happy I have a dentists appointment so I can postpone this frustration.
These armballs make no sense yo.
Most of the gems make very little sense.
The basic cast makes perfect sense.
Its when we get into bigger fusions things go weird.
Like sugilite has this ball construct where her shoulder should be from which extends a cone from which sprout 2 hands.
Oh hey 100% OJ is getting a physical release.
I should get a copy just so I can destroy it.
Oh right now I need to clear my youtube history of 2012 memes to fix the suggestions.
I just diable the history tracking.
Yeah but then I get only default recommendations.
Which is almost as bad.
The default recommendations are awful.
As it is I basically just get looped back to the channels I watch anyway.
Top fails of 2016 teens react to OLD GAMES!?!?!?
People are awful and they like bad things.
They should be ashamed.
Anathema i'll take the same old dumb bad suggestions all the time.
Over youtube wanting me to watch literally all the x just because i looked at x once a week ago.
Top gear recommended channel for you fucking google.
Tldr youtube is shit.
Noelor why do they remove so many awesome features of the previous gen every gen? D.
For example. Where's my this route is complete! stamp c.
MairBear its gone no longer will you ever be satisfied with route completion.
MoonWolf I will have to google the routes. c.
You are a bad man.
I have no words for this mission. My words have failed me. Well that's worrying coming from the XCOM2 LP.
MairBear stamps are per island now.
MoonWolf dyr my office Windows password is a line from the UBW invocation.
I'm now up to the depressing bit.
Where to log in I have to type PlaceIWork\Noelor » Will Never Hold Anything.
MairBear thanks for pack.
Minister its a good thing people can't see individual lines of it because it'd be pretty morbid.
!note MairBear Thanks for Malygos.
Now i just need nozdormu and onyxia.
And i'll have all the Big dragons.
Ah time for the post car riding phantom riding feelings.
Well that's certainly a thing.
I have no words for this mission. My words have failed me. Well that's worrying coming from the XCOM2 LP <- thats just a jadestart stream meme thing.
Watching the update I kind of see his point.
Yeeaaaah I can really see it.
Well now I really see what he meant.
Urgh I wish there was an HD remaster of the original NGE anime available for sale instead of this stupid remake.
Oh goddamnit please dont tell me I have to keep closing thse damned gates in every city now.
Not sure there are enough cheats in the engine to make me want to go through that.
There's probably a cheat to stop them spawning.
Yeah but my quest is to get the cities to help me.
Which they wont do.
Before I close the damned gates.
You can set quest stages via the console too.
Oh yeah there was that command. now I just have to dig it up.
Apparently there is also a command for closing the.
GlennCuddlefish what about those valuable keystones though!
Or whatever they were called.
Meik made a hat out of one I think.
Pretty sure I can get everything I need done with basic grand soulstones.
Minister So apparently Stephen Fry made a documentary about languages a couple of years back if you're curious.
CookedAuto appreciate the thought but I've actually watched it through twice already ^^.
It's on Netflix.
Well I wasnt aware of that so =p.
You wouldn't be.
I was more trying to justify myself =P.
Look at GlennCuddlefish with his fancy symbols.
Now I am not saying I am an expert in fancy lines such as the last one but I got a degree in it.
Professor Glenn o7.
Jade got a fucking execute on the fucking last ruler.
I had hoped all of the new skins would be terrible.
So I would not have to waste my time playing this sucking fucking anger simulator.
Also giving a fucking swede the santa skin.
Blizzards tasteless shenanigans go too far at times.
I'm sure Dob is looking for a partner for this.
I dont want to play with people I have to communicate with in the future the risk of screaming social link destroying things is too high.
Besides its not like I can play at 100% capacity until I figure out the framerate issue anyway.
Like I ever play OW at 100% capacity.
Ok wait a minute. they took eco point and made it colder and snowier.
It's fucking antarctica southern hemisphere in december you dolts!
To be fair a major plot point in one of the characters backstories is that climate is all whack yo.
Overwatch is now playable.
If I dont report back in angrily within 3 hours send help.
Added a new “Boop” unlockable voice line for Sombra Very important to note. Extremly important in fact.
I do kind of need a new computer wallpaper. Still using Halloween Mercy.
...I did not even opent the game yet and you angered me with those news C_A.
GlennCuddlefish Boop line is CRITICAL.
Hero was unplayable without it.
Well it was immediately discussed on the aftermath of blizzcon and they said yes.
And it was first scouted on the ptr with oasis.
Its pandering ot the lowest common denominator.
It's sombra when was it ever not?
GlennCuddlefish people who like sombra to say boop ?
Haha should have seen the game connection failed coming.
Okay turns out my client was failing cos it hadnt realised it needed patching.
Token loot box on arrival. drops a legendary. holy shit. oh no wait it's only coin.
I wish I got coin.
Instead of duplicates.
Aww the zarya event emote is so cute one phase of it at least.
Wow this brawl.
Snowballs with their own unique one-off projectile physics.
Your weapon is single ammo with select reload points and a channel time.
And it's one hit KO.
SO GOOD FUCKING LUCK LEARNING ITS TRAJECTORY RESPONSE.
Just about to try it out. will be fun with my fps bouncing between 15 and 30ps.
Oh hey thats what I always get.
Yeah its unplayable at those rates.
Worgen Druid name.
Good lord that was painful.
Okay once I get the token loot box from this snowbrawl is gonna see much less play than lucioball.
Red team's mei their balls penetrate ice walls.
Oh and they ice block 1 microsecond before your snowball hits when in practically melee range.
Broken as fuck.
Just as I was despairing what to watch I was informed I was dumber than a baboon and there in fact is a lucha underground torrent on TPB.
I was planning on watching that westworld thing everyone is raving about.
It will have to wait.
Actually I might wait until saturday until watching more I have a feeling we might end up marathoning that with a friend once we get tired of videogames.
Seen the first two it was pretty good.
It rly doesnt.
Right there. its done. I have finished oblivion.
It was an ok game I think I liked it better than skyrim in the end.
Still no morrowind.
Just looted glenn's least favourite skin from the new patch oops.
Its a fine skin.
ON A DIRTY SWEDE.
Look at what this games performance is making me do! Mercy POTG.
And I only rezzed like 2 people.
Got nano boosted as mercy the other day as last man standing in double support comp on 66 defence.
Didnt end well.
True til valhalla moment.
Ok point taken glenn so just SATW politics then =P.
Look there are a few basic facts in life Sun is bright water is wet and santa is finnish. Not from the north pole not from sweden FROM FINLAND.
Can you phone santa on christmas even in sweden and have him answer your messages in live TV? I THINK NOT.
Stealth patch feature bots for Mei. Can now play ultimate custom game of slaughter for stress relief.
Play > custom game > add ai > choose hero > mei probably set to easy.
Just had a discussion with Stellaris QA about the potential game mechanics of raising sentient aliens for food. yessss.
Why woul dyou do that.
This is so weird.
Why wouldn't you do that?
Look soilent green has to be people.
Soilent green can't be aliens.
Its just wrong.
Sure just brand it nutripurple.
Go for Soylent viridians instead.
MoonWolf what if I want to be the zerg but be ethical about it!?
Thats not a thing anathema.
What if I'm a vegan and I'm raising plant people to eat?
Then you have an interesting defintion of vegan.
1.5 is gonna rock can't wait for it to be released in 2018.
I think Im about to hit an end-game crisis in Stellaris.
Last night before I stopped I got a weird subspace readings message and then everyone in the galaxy re-opened their borders to me.
I recently used the unsafe sentient AI tech to make all my ships better.
Oh I'm going to get a tyranid-esque swarm.
Last night I placed a tourist attraction on a planet I conquered with a Monument to Purity.
Was it the xcom planet ?
No I stopped performing expirements on them and replaced all their leaders with agents them assimilated them into my empire.
What about the ethnical cleansing ?
I stopped doing that for now it makes other empires too unhappy.
I need to become the strongest before I start commiting genocide again.
There's an acheivement for purging all other sentient species.
The Most Pure.
Suffer not the alien.
40k reference ofc.
Blood for the blood god etc.
Pff the mighty Terran Empire does not believe in superstitius nonsense.
The only confusing thing is that game also spawned a Commonwealth of Man empire.
The caption for the sentient ship AI is great something about improving their effectiveness by giving them a fear of death.
Hey this survey from Obsidian suggests I should have gottena cloth map with PoE I'm sure I did not.
Did you get the collectors edition ?
Physical collectors edition*.
I think you should have yeah.
I wear the tshirt often and use the mousemat.
Maybe I'm dumb and missed it and it is still in the box I'll check tonight.
I'm sure I checked though because I would definitely be hanging a cloth map on my wall.
Personally i'm not a collectors edition sort of person.
So i just sent them a survey full of don't care and please don't.
You're a butt.
I want more physical things that are useful.
They wanted my opinion.
I gave it to them.
Don't care about a plushy but if the cookbook was an actual physical thing? that would be great.
Maybe if there was an option to ask for a spacepig figurine.
But there wasn't one.
Damn Darren Korb and his weird guitar.
That's the way it goes.
Well at least I got DoA5 running at acceptable rates.
Even if I am kind of worried about my CPU temps lately.
Pretty sure it shouldn't be at constant 85-90 degrees when under load.
Kara no Kyoukai A magical mass murdering girl in a kimono and worlds most forgiving boy are really bad at romance also there is supernatural stuff i guess.
Worst case of reinhardt play I've seen yet.
I can take the charging in 1v5 only to die but this one couldnt find his fucking hammer.
Was standing with his shield up against another rein casually smashing his face in and doing fuck all.
The story the entire match. also a pharah no-one could figure out how to shoot.
Kara no kyoukai 8 you thought shiki had two personalities nope she has three now.
Schizophrenia does that to you.
No its worse its metaphysical nasu bullshit.
I can take the charging in 1v5 only to die <- not doing that is the hardest thing as Rein for me.
That usually happens when I press shift instead of e.
Because I'm stupid.
I have no idea why that happens to me. Something just snaps and off I go.
Yeah it happens to me too.
I probably play a more flanker rein than I should. But who else is gonna go wreck the widow standing on that balcony.
In further 'loot boxes are weird to me' news got the event mei skin today as well.
All i've gotten is even sprays.
And none of them are good.
I got the maccree skin I think that covers the essentials for this year.
BwaS why is everyone terrible at mei-ball.
1 infinite ammo game suddenly puts you in single ammo scenario.
2 what even the fuck are the snowball particle physics.
I have been accused of cheating for using my ult.
3 oh I'm dead any way I can improve and practise the mechanics? nah I can only spectate the drawn out remaining 5v5.
Well it is a completely recoded one like in lucioball with no forewarning.
Look i have 2 crates to get in brawl this week and everyone is playing may-ball.
Well you say that but I'm completely sure I put that ice wall up the instant I saw a red mei then 1 sec later a ball hit me having come through the wall.
I have to say overwatch is an amazing game.
I slept less than I should have drank a bottle of vodka last night and my wrist is in more pain than I would like.
And I still have procrastinated over playing overwatch by making headway in the christmas cleanup.
Well I take back what I said about DoA5 running.
It does however represent me with a bit of a mystery.
Why are none of these config files actually doing anything?
Is there another set in my documents or somewhere ?
Which also does nothing.
Then i have no clue.
GlennCuddlefish oh hey Central Fiction won't have an Extend version. So I no longer feel need to purposefully delay buying it. Now it's just about my funds.
Which ones central fiction again.
The newest one.
BlazBlue that is.
I didn't knwo what game it was.
I just knew it was a fighting game.
I remembered it was blazblue I just cant remember which one.
Because it had an utterly nonsense title.
This is how i recongnize fighting games.
By nonsense names.
Its still no UNIEL.
This is a good marker to follow in general though you have to concede that.
I'm just saying that Central Fiction could just be a melty blood series entry.
Now I also have to check which blazblue I actually own.
Considering the names its been using.
Nope not that one. not in a hurry to buy the latest one anyway just now.
Act Cadenza Actress Again Current Code Central Fiction.
It just fits.
Right. I think I got it to finally understand that shadows and AA is too much for my toaster.
I'll foolishly hope for a cross platform play for it. So that I can lose horribly to you.
I will repeat myself ITs still not as bad as UNIEL.
Ahahaha cross platform play.
Also santa is real.
And sinterklaas isn't racist.
Hey hey hey.
Didn't SF have cross platform?
I think so.
Oh hey BBCF will have cross play!!... between... ps3 and ps4.
Not really stretching the limits of modern technology there.
But the thing is I dont think arcsys is willing to run their own servers for that.
Which is what sony requires them to do for cross plat.
Warning a mouse dies in this video.
Expecting a bait and switch of someone's hardware mouse.
Wait why is cloud dressed as aeris?
That's just a thing some couples do.
Don't yuck someone's yums GlennCuddlefish.
...what does that even mean.
I was definintely not expecting the Viper King to be turned into a onesie.
Noelor the other ones also turn into armor.
Also odd to me.
The berserk queen turns into a muscle suit.
I thought that was lightning.
The joke is that Lightning is 'Cloud but a lady' MairBear.
Oh I see.
Wtd happened to the archon? o.0.
Is fall damage a thing?
Not on that fall.
So there is a weapon mod.
That gives a 5/10/15% chance to just kill something.
It works on rulers.
I'd forgotten that mod did that.
I guess I never fought a 100+hp thing to conceive of it that way.
I installed a mdo to stop that.
Because really its dumb.
MairBear why was this brawl not the brawl the week before release.
Blizzard can't do anything right.
... you're fucking shitting me.
They gave the paladin deck pyro equality.
The priest is just straight up dragons.
So I've heard.
BwaS i only played the paladin once but i had no draw cards.
Its a really weird midrangy goon paladin with no draw.
Well this guy's already had double loot hoarder acolye.
Or i just didn't get the draw cards.
Okay if this classic pack is to be believed I never pulled a 2nd mirror entity.
Don't think I'll give it a repeat visit. too much RP for my liking.
Also that ogre from chicago does my head in.
He's great imho.
To win with goons seems to be hardest.
Cos you just have good minions with a great budget in dragon deck. And a billion jade golems in the other.
Dragon deck is just a solid deck all round.
Unles you get stuck with no dragons in hand.
Well I would have had a billion had mr paladin not conveniently pyro equality'd my fandral the turn before I drew jade idol.
And then I chicogre'd a doppelgangster. And won.
Doppelgangster is ridiculous with buffs.
Looking forward to seeing people use the next 3 months worth of ladder card backs on the 'wrong' class.
Hey that jade cardback is sweet.
Thinking of finally replacing my default with it.
Its been black temple for a veyr long time now.
Wish there was a good dragon-ish cardback.
The LotV one works nice on priest which i guess is dragonish.
Don't have that one.
Some tings can't be explained like you are 5.
Sometimes thinkgs are just hard.
I love some of these though.
Wellp caught my first Ultra Beast.
Unrelated I was just addressed as variations thereupon.
You are quite the variation.
And am laughing too much.
Noelor ... did you get very creative with your name this game ?
Nono this was irl.
Full phrase Ladies gentleman and variations thereupon...
Does facebook have arbitrary pick whatever you want for that yet ?
Because you should spend some time as a variations thereupon.
Just please don't ask me to use that in a regular sentence.
I think it's still a fixed list?
Gender variant is on there though.
It has autocompletion.
Noelor Brionne has some amazing animations.
Mine was not Brionne for very long due to when I got it.
Also the moon dex entry is d'aww.
MairBear did you end up with my alakazam for some reason?
Can you get a ralts or ralts line pokemon in the game without outside trading ?
Oh hey I have the German pokédex entry for Brionne.
And uh don't think so.
You can get different language pokedex entries ?
Yeah if you get an instance of that pokémon from another language version of the game.
So the first Brionne I got was from someone playing in German who really really wanted a Shellder.
Sometimes you really want a shellder.
Maybe for a gimmick team.
Was German invented by White Wolf's writers?
Oh wait don't you need a shelder for a slowking?
It looks like every Noun is capitalised.
Noelor yes every noun is capitalised.
That is a thing.
Wait is it actually every?
Its not a weird proper noun thing.
Just every noun.
I thought it'd just be subjects or something.
That would be more sensible imho.
Do german nouns inflect for grammar?
Total bullshit round of route 66 on competitive.
Red team goes first needs overtime on all three checkpoints to clear.
Blue team gets the full clear within time.
But ofc a win doesn't go to fastest time it goes to who can get furthest in a decider push.
Red team lives matter.
Aint overwatch FUN.
I KNOW RIGHT?
And this is why I've sworn of all MP except co-op.
High school survival technique 3! She's using the uniform she just took off as a decoy! sure is japan in this game.
MairBear are you excited for MICRO HOLLIDAYS ?
No very excited no.
More excited by rag in HotS though.
Trouble is seems everyone's playing him so it's long queues vs AI.
Which means getting paired with all manner of bot difficulties. Causing games to be a bit too fast.
Ragnaros in HotS!?
Maybe.. or yesterday I forget when HotS week is.
If only hots was a good game that would be fun to play.
Worlds most adorable evangellion picture.
Also angels.
Ftrbzzs Emily got my an aeropress for christmas now I can go back to having good coffee at work o/.
Well that took a bit longer than I expected.
Figured I'd dust my computer to drop the temperatures.
So I unplug everything and start doing that with what little tools I have. then I figured what the hell I have a nearly identical computer sitting next to this one might as well upgrade the memory on this.
So I added 2 gigs of ram on the side. and then I start thinking is this power actually powerful enough? and spent 15 minutes sorting out cables in both cases and switching the power to a slightly more powerful one.
Well you're back so it probably worked.
Well nothing exploded.
Not sure if it helped any yet.
Also I just realized I completely forgot to save the sugilite thing I was working on. oh well I can do better this time.
More ram is more ram.
You only notice it when you... do more things that need ram.
Such as using firefox with my browsing habits.
Thing is I dont think I can make the critical upgrade for 4 more gigs at the moment on this computer. at least I dont see any point in doing so.
Well at least my idle temperatures are a lot lower. time to see how overwatch runs.
Enjoy your mei-ball.
Ha ha no not touching that before I can confirm I fixed this.
Loading times still take forever. might need to upgrade my HD at some point as well.
Maybe find out what happened to the HD in the PS3 that died that thing had seen hardly any use.
Ps3 hdd's are compatible with pc's?
Yesthey are just standard 3.5 sata drives.
Well ok it runs much better.
Now I just wish it wasn't so badly programmed.
Played the whole round without the game loading any actual character models.
Yeah have that every now and again too.
Good thing you dont need to actually see anyone as mercy.
Except yknow the red team in your backline trying to blow your face off that are conveniently invisible to the other blues.
The HUD still works. also my ears.
Also seeing that guy really does not help you just know what killed you.
Well one of the things seems to have fixed it.
And thats the snowball fight dealt with. what a horrible mode.
GlennCuttlefish i like the idea.
Its terrible to play with pubbies.
Becaues half the players are in there for the first time.
And have no clue.
Or waste their shot before the game even starts.
And then don't know how to reload.
Because nobody reads the introductory text.
Replace the tutorial with a mandatory level where you solve simple riddles.
People who can't solve the riddles play together only.
One of them is reading 5 lines of text.
Thing I dislike is the downtime between rounds.
Snowball fights to me aren't usually about tense last man standing mexican standoffs.
More the keep throwing until we run out of snow in the field / it gets too dark / someone's injured / clothes too wet.
I'm putting a stone in this one.
Proof mei is definitly evil.
Oh boy oh boy random games continue being not fun.
Yeah its frustrating.
Had mystery heroes on king's snow on defence rolled zarya during the street phase.
Got a sick graviton on like 3 or 4 when they had triple tank and we flippin wiped them.
Then they randomed conveniently into double bastion and just killdozed to the win.
MoonWolf> she shows up to snowball fight with launcher capable of firing icicles to penetrate a man's skull at 50m what you expect?
Stupid sexy tracer.
Thanks for confirming what I've suspected as men grow older our bodies build muscle by consuming our hair. so that's where it went.
This explains onepunch man.
He got so strong his body needed all his hair.
Freeze mage v dragon priest. drakonid operative discovers roaring torch.
He ended up using it for lethal after the ice block.
Noelor i don't know if you follow the asuras wrath lp thread.
Or just the videos.
But Asura's wrath fanfiction Ideas Kill Six Billion Gohma.
And yeah MoonWolf I just watch the videos.
This one.
Enjoy that thread highlight then.
Kaplan on the Mei skin.
AND YES tiny Pandora had to also be a cat girl and in that outfit. For reasons. Important reasons. sure Dan.
One of the people in the mall has a magical ability to make all invisible ancients turn into cat-people.
It's probably Catalina.
Its a very disapointed magic mark experiment who doesn't even know its happening.
Ok this symmetra buff to her primary fire is ridiculous and unnecessary.
BwaS they made symmetra great again.
Except her m1 was already a lololol imma chunk you now kk but now she gets range for it greater than mei's m1/reaper/torb m2.
It still has its rampup time.
This should be the soundtrack for jade decks running everyone's favourite best girl pandaren.
BwaS ì would not mind it if decks or cardbacks or whatever else had music.
It'd be expensive so it wont happen.
But it would be amazing.
Play ragnaros time for rag music.
Like each player brings their own OST piece to their deck and whoever's in the lead gets a crescendor.
Gwent has a soundtrack for different factions you play.
Meanwhile in flip flappers.
GlennCuttlefish i thought it was a show about silly magical girls ?
And then things happened.
What the fuck google.
I wanted to see if that movie Arrival was still on because my dad talked about wanting to see it.
I typed 'Arrival' into google.
It reminded me of the arrival time of the flight I booked to Amsterdam.
And then confirmed that said movie is still on next week.
I mean... sorta?
Helping is a bit creepy.
Just a smidge.
You're going to amsterdam eh?
Well Osaka via Amsterdam.
My other thought was schipol doings yes.
Because KLM continues to be the best option for getting to Japan given my priorities.
Its a bit weird that the best way to get to Japan from the UK is to get a flight from a Dutch airline.
But you know whatever works.
Serious Sam VR.
MoonWolf well specifically from Newcastle.
On a Saturday morning.
Watch headless guys with bombs for hands run at you in a straight line while screaming IN VR.
You'll never know what you missed.
MoonWolf> the best way for me to get from UK to Aus is with UAE airline.
Flying is weirfd.
Oh boy this is the least mad I've been at overwatch today.
Nah BA are monopolistic tossers who want everything to go through crowded T5.
First match I join right as it ends.
Second not enough players.
Third not enough players.
And now I've been stuck in a queue for 3 minutes.
BwaS also nearly antipodal travel.
I'd expect to stop somewhere.
... fucking linguists =P.
Noelor it hits with the power of antipode ?
Flies with the power of antipode.
MoonWolf my dad asked for a CRPG for xmas so I'm planning on gifting him Pillars on steam.
Because he enjoyed Baldurs Gate back in the day.
Worth adding the expansions?
I hope your dad likes it.
But thats more for you to judge.
Honestly at this point i'm watching the asuras wrath lp for the commercials.
The fuckin' cliffhanger this week though.
Dog dad has a hard and exciting life.
At some point I was given a 10 Czech Koruna coin instead of a 2p.
I can't spend it.
I guess it could be worth more?
I'm bagging up a year's worth of change.
Pennies are so garbage~.
I think there's a loony party manifesto that had we will get the royal mint to print a 99 pence piece.
Would rather an actual party abolished them.
Well at least I now have both worthwhile player icons from christmas boxes.
Wait no damnit there is a third pachimari one.
The universe is really conspiring against me doing this drawing request for a friend.
Had no motivation to draw all day after I forgot to save before I turned off my computer for the dusting.
Watched some anime about art related stuff finally got some motivation.....Tablet drivers refuse to work again.
Well I can still fix this its not too late...its half past 3.
Maybe I should just start yelling at people again in overwatch.
Even if I dont play ranked. Because that would make my head explode.
Yeah I'm putting ranked to one side for now. the last couple games I had on that were just really limit-pushing.
4 back to back rounds of route 66 is fun yo.
Basically landed at seasonal high that I don't dare risk losing to a loss streak so soon.
Even if my career high is like 500 rating higher from last season apparently they radically shifted what each mmr meant though even with same numbers.
Its weird I think people take arcade 6v6 more seriously than quick play.
Sure the compositions are whack but.
GlennCuttlefish they need those weekly boxes!
Final Fantasy XIII - Being The Chosen One Will Kill Your Dating Life.
These all seem pretty accurate.
I don't care how cute you are in pictures Navi i still hate you.
MairBear lifecoaches wife is playing in seatstorycup called her wifecoach.
GlennCuttlefish want to come do a mythic thing?
It's 3.49 in the morning and I'm playing through the first scenario of Kingdom Death. And pretty much the first thing I've done is punch a lion's dick off seems legit.
At least he's into it ?
OMG really blizz.
One of the new Nightfallen quests you have to dispel illusions...
Leather skull-emblazoned rock-pants ok.
Wait are they made of leather or are they made of rock.
Ignoring that rock is not a good pants material.
If the pants are made of rock I mis-hyphened because the skulls must be made of leather.
First Island completed \o/.
Now to backtrack to the areas I can break through.
Noelor Team skull though...
Team 'what are even doing' Skull.
MairBear get back to me when you reach the bus stop tbh.
Also now you've unlocked most of the first island I'll re-advise that you can scan it for Chikorita after filling in seen gaps in your 'dex by scanning ten of these.
They just let you catch a starter from another generation ?
MoonWolf only once per day and which one it is and where depends on when in the week you do it.
How many are available this way ?
28 pokémon 7 days * 4 islands.
Of which 6 are starters.
Gens 2 and 5.
I figured they'd have more starters in there.
They're pretty popular afterall.
Oh man heroes brawl this week is pretty painful.
Now I remember why they take haunted mines out of the rotation.
Whats the brawl ?
Haunted mines a map they just brought back from hiatus with a rework that's just a full length QM game but with random picks.
Lemme read up how they unfucked mines.
Made it a bit wider jungle 4 camps instead of 3 mines has 4 entrances instead of 2 repositioned the skull camps in the mine area.
And golems push both lanes alternating.
That last part seems pretty good.
Sounds like a great way to make the game grind out.
Oh yes it sure does.
Oh wait yeah.
But it's not like battlefield where they push least damaged lane.
Battlefields conflict points are nto as much a pain in the ass thoug.
Plus mines and gardens are still too similar.
Fight the things to get the point to get the big pushy unit.
Fight the things to *pick up* the points.
Because they can be stolen =P.
True seeds vs skulls has a much different distribution between big and small camps though.
I remember getting yelled at for being Sgt Hammer on those maps.
Still the problem is that you need to go fight all over the map.
It doens't create conflict points it just creates mass jungle phases.
People yell at you for being sgt hammer just in general.
Anyway I'm-a go see some wars.
Enjoy your wars.
MoonWolf> I think Vader's in this one?
Only as background though ?
No clue =P.
Yes Vader has a small cameo in R1.
Sorry mair 1 I was out 2 I'm out of time.
GlennCuttlefish you monster with your things to do and also fine of course.
Bahaha HS quest for play overload cards. impossible shaman deck of only overloads.
Still got 2 straight wins out of it and progressed a 'win as shaman' quest.
Turns out crackle is a pretty toxic card.
Oh yeah fuck crackle.
Never liked it.
Like I one-shot the 3/6 dragon taunt with a full roll.
Then against a warrior it was I have 7 mana doomhammer and a crackle that rolls 4 or more is lethal let's go for it.
They should have just not had Vader tbh.
I dunno I thought they used him with good effect.
Omfg alolan dugtrio how did I miss this.
They were using dig that's why.
As a test of grog levels can't believe there were no Bothans in that movie.
The joke is there were never going to be Bothans BwaS.
Talking of spoilers there's a movie coming up or out already? called Passengers.
This afternoon I knew nothing about it other than who was in it.
And now I know the major plot beats including a probably twist.
Because trailers are still awful.
Damn it Noelor that's still ROTJ D<.
Noelor and now I know the major plot beats including a probably twist - It should be noted that some of the early concepts of it was almost worse and creepier.
Cooked_Auto grog meter calibrated =P.
Noelor So I chased down the scan things.
But my DS timer is apparently stil wrong as it thought it was Saturday already I did it before midnight.
Oops I guess.
Which 'mon showed up instead?
Well that seems ok =3.
Six? really PatternSpider.
I give that a 'shop a 7/10.
Wait what David Tennant as Scrooge.
Hm. Japan is finally legalizing gambling and casinos.
OW 1v1 is garbage |.
I'm not jsut mad I lost.
When you see it.
It should be noted that's a set specific to the Netherlands.
I'm not seeing it wh atever it is.
The second hint is Roxanne.
That returned a square for me so I assume you're trying to emoji me P.
This guy is badass takes the time to make fun of his son for doing CrossFit during his interview D.
Is there a new years plan.
Well details can be discussed but the general idea is my place as few or as many days as you want bringing laptops advised but depending on where my brother is at the time we might have a surplus.
Okay I will.
Talk to noelor.
You should all be honest with eachother and admit its just going to be all ofyou trading pokemon.
Twins they were!
Hot twin on twin action.
Oh mr. heimlich from the maneuvre has died.
Symmetry is so op now.
Legit kill rein before he can kill you back.
Anathema he can just shield up.
And unless you are alone you can't just run behind that shield because his team is there.
This game.
MairBear seatstorycup doens't have our favourite pink haired hs host so they instead have a soundboard.
GlennCuttlefish i can't believe you are actually playing this.
I cant see why I play weird stuff from time to time.
Yeah but its so ... creepy.
And not in a fun horror sort of way.
But in an ugh i don't want to look at human face horse sort of way.
Really? I just find it funny.
GlennCuttlefish So my password wasn't working.
And it's cos I was using my WoW authenticator.
Not my FF.
Mair you are the best at videogames.
Noelor are you here yet.
Must resist urge to buy laptop today just so I can play overwatch over Christmas.
You should resist that urge.
Succumb to the dark side.
Come to the dark side we have mei and symmetra.
Question why does that Nier trailer use that faux-cyrilic font?
It looks more alien.
The game isn't set in neo-moscow or anything.
Not that we know.
Its just set in somewhere in the vague post apocalyptical future.
Noelor probably easier to contact CS over email or twitter dm or something.
Also its once more the season for the best christmas song.
Or this one.
How do I reach you by train.
As memory serves there was a train that went through winchester starting/ending at Southampton Central and Newcastle.
Ok if I get an evening train I arrive in Winchester around 11 or later.
From what I've gathered that's not actually a practical time to then get out to yours.
Oh I got pokérus at some point.
Wish I'd noticed that sooner.
Yay free stats.
Drat need to run but if that's 11 PM then it's viable enough that we can pick you up. If it's AM then there's buses.
Oh evening train yeah there's no public transport out but picking up is amenable no worries.
A very serious game.
The mos tserious.
!note MairBear I'll be arriving 1ish on the 31st leaving 2 on the 2nd because those are the sole times for the not-transfering-via-Tube train.
MoonWolf omg latest Rayearth.
You have to admit that was quality animation.
Also anime as fuck.
I'm only halfway through.
The swimming lesson was glorious.
Wait untill you see the actual swimming.
Its SO BAD.
Also how did the girl with water powers need swimming lessons.
Also Morrisey reference because 1995.
Shouldn't she just swimming as part of her powerset or something.
Because a it's a special technique.
And b what a beefcake!
If twilight has taught me anything is that this guy is a chick magnet.
Broody beefcake abusive.
Now nobody can flip coins.
I think my computer likes browsing the worst kind of tumblrs in my absence.
I come back from visiting my cousins and my computer is playing a song about killing all men in youtube.
Of course the next question is how did it get there and since when has autoplay even been enabled on youtube.
Yeah I came back earlier this week to my computer playing music when I could've sworn I had put the music player on pause before I went so I was a bit confused for a moment.
I mean I once got home and GlennCuttlefish and MoonWolf were having a conversation in my computer.
Which given I live alone was incredibly disorienting when I walked through the front door.
I think that's who it was anyway.
Noelor sorry ?
Sorry for making you think we broke into your apartment just so we could discuss nerdy stuff.
MoonWolf np I guess.
This was months ago obviously I actually just left mumble on overnight/day.
Did an anathema.
Oh yeah MoonWolf I saw something really weird this morning at my friends'.
So it was an OK-Go music video right.
But all they did was play their instruments and sing.
You are right.
In normal-speed video.
That is weird.
Is it ok ? i'm not sure its ok.
Link's not ok I suppose.
Noelor back btw if further thoughts were had.
I need to stop playing board games with my family.
Getting called the greatest spoilsport for commenting on balance issues with fucking cluedo.
Play better games tbh.
Last time I played boardgames with the family I stonefaced myself to a victory on Ticket to Ride P.
I will lend you Mysterium it's literally Cluedo But Good.
Well okay pokerfaced I guess but still.
Well there is a catan and a ticket to ride in the family.
TTR was gifted to mum 2yrs ago and is in Aus.
Catan was gifted to sister last yr and is daan saath.
It was my brother and my dad who bought TTR last year as the christmas game.
Sadly I doubt it'd ever get any of them to play Lords of Waterdeep with me p.
And I'm maybe not the go to FLGS and spend upwards of a hundred on getting personal copies of essentials types.
To be fair a lot of the games at the Boardgame Cafe/FLGS interest me all that much.
I just tried Waterdeep on a whim one day and liked it. Same with Marvel Legendary encounters a game that reeeaaaaaally needs a rerelease.
Especially after getting one of the expansions the base game is in dire need of an art upgrade and a switch from a board to a gaming mat like Alien has.
Also the fact that as it's december playing cluedo requires the state-mandated december playlist.
Oh look a choral rendition of o come all ye faithful never heard that before!
If it wasn't for the radio station we listening to having played christmas music since the end of last month I'm sure there'd barely be any of that bar the 24th.
MoonWolf> new protag bumping in to old harrison ford playing his character from first film suggests sequel to me =P.
Russian ambassador shot in turkey.
Plz don't go to war.
Well they shot down their fighter jet beforehand and managed to keep their fingers off further triggers.
Fighter over arguably the wrong country border.
Is a little different from ambassador.
Apparently the shooter has been ID as a turkish polie officer. And was latter gunned down.
Thats ... doesn't help.
Would have been much better if it was some random asshole.
That wouldn't have helped either anyway.
Now this one I'm not going to miss out on.
But WHY is he killing everyone.
This is important.
What's really important is that the dog survives.
MoonWolf ! Want to win a HS for me?
GlennCuttlefish I mean it's not called Smart People of Age.
Maybe rename it terrible underage people then.
It's called Dumbing of Age which both communicates how smart the cast are and is a pun.
Someone hadn't seen pictures of The Rock from the 80s.
So I g'imaged it.
And accidentally selected a gif.
Noelor good choice.
In further shit board games news neighbours family visiting in tonight talking amicably about Monopoly and the playing of it on the 25th.
I really need to slap 9 yr old me who loved the shit out of his france 98 world cup theme set.
Games I would never get myself to play includes Risk and Monopoly. And possibly Axis Allies too.
MairBear you know Nebby yeah?
Nebby is a Cosmog.
I just got my own Cosmog in the post-game.
Unaware how apt an ability.
MairBear also the move.
Wait what? D=.
Well I guess TIL exists.
I slept for 3 hours after getting home last night but it really helped.
Anathema sleeping is good.
Even better I slept so well I was able to go to the gym this morning.
I have been waiting over 15 years for this.
Well I know someone who will be interested in the DEldar boardgame at least.
Anathema So they did it again btw.
Saint Celestine at the head of a Black Templars crusade into the Cadian gate.
Spoilers everyone dies.
Thats the 40k endgame anyway so who cares.
I believe this is the second best picture from the Witcher 3 cosplay calendar.
Holy filters batman.
Anathema A reply on got on twitter after mentioning plastic sisters oh my god ive been waiting for this longer than some of my gaming group have been alive.
The company once known as SOE.
So tldr those games might as well be dead.
The development teams responsible for these MMO’s have left Turbine to form a new independent company called Standing Stone Games. Pretty much yes.
Why the hell do you even have a setting for that?!
Why is that even in te game?
It's a survival game so I guess they have their reasons for it.
Alberta Parks has issued a sincere warning about moose licking vehicles in Kananaskis.
Just let the moose lick your car and don't piss it off its a moose it'll win.
A reply on got on twitter after mentioning plastic sisters oh my god ive been waiting for this longer than some of my gaming group have been alive <- for a moment I was very confused.
<- so buffy with smartphones ?
Or more social media.
More dating site demons.
Prety sure that was actually a episode.
Or maybe it was just email dating.
Also the IT teacher was a computer witch.
So really aside from outdated machines.
Still fairly modern.
Anathema witch that used technology in spells.
So a technomancer?
I think they used technopagan ?
Bloody Virtual Adepts basically the technocracy.
Even if I was thinking SR Technomancers more p.
Huh first meeting about that work coach program this week. On Friday. Having Christmas on a saturday makes things weird.
Anathema GW has posted a bunch of high res shots of the new models.
Also it seems like ADB might be writing something for the Fall of Cadia event.
Will check out tonight.
Oh he only wrote the trailer.
Anathema From a summary of the stream they had about it While this isn't a full release for the Sisters they did hint at them coming along later. Also out on the 7th as well.
That's fine I have a massive painting backlog.
I am surprisingly fine with this.
Heroic EN run with a pug.
Kill Il'gynoth in his first reconstruction phase.
So who wants to buy these for Smurf?
Whoop one shot Emerald Nightmare HC in just under an hour.
Now I don't need to worry about that silly link achieve stopgap.
I feel like they went the easy way out by giving Tracer a girlfriend in this case.
That better mean we are getting cannon mercy/pharah.
Because they're cute together ?
Doesnt seem like it based on that page spread.
Oh boy it was one of those rounds.
So along with my head-canon that she's a brexit-voting arsenal-supporter she's also disorganised doing her christmas shopping on the 24th.
Brilliant thanks blizz.
BwaS you really hate tracer don't you.
And can't stand up to her girfriend for the sake of winston C.
I dunno all tracers I meet do all their blink bollocks then snap back 90 degrees perfectly to resume hitscanning.
~MoonWolf BwaS you really hate tracer don't you - funny enough one of the players in my Shadowrun group also hates her. Or is at least heavily annoyed by her since she doesnt play OW =P.
MairBear> where do you get the 'for the sake of winston' bit from?
Unless I missed it in the last two pages her girl kept the scarf.
So as I was saying back then my team was me as mercy a roadhogs 2 trollbjorns and a widow. on offense.
Ah yes a well known offensive lineup.
The tank/support/sniper/2 turrets linup.
So the scarf was intended as gift for winston?
That was my interpretation.
I was kinda going off it's not for you as some little chav gave it to me.
Err. I dont think it was?
Yeah thats what I got from it.
Maybe a retroactive well I was shopping for that exact item for you so it works in the end?
Or more that she didnt actually know what was inside it.
And didn't really want to embarrass her.
I see maccree does christmas eves my way.
Glenny no D.
PS SUCK IT SHIPPERS SUCK IT.
Mm even if Sombra isn't too impressed by the booze.
In a bar with a mexican julian assange expy? you dog.
Relax mair I do see my family in the early evenings. Just afterwards I have gone to a pub for the night.
She's one of them ponces who reads the cocktail menu and goes for something elaborate only to find it's an acquired taste.
Her starbucks order takes 2 minutes to explain.
Nah Sombra is pretty much mexican at her heart so she'd probably just go for Corona or something.
With the lime stuck down the neck.
Only way to make that swill drinkable.
I was going to say Dos Equis but Corona is the more well known one.
Is san miguel mexican?
Why do these people play to lose.
They enjoy fun.
Because competitive is that way.
Yeah i'm here for the 4 snipers symmetra lucio comps.
The lucio really wants to win.
Its me i'm the lucio.
I am not even playing comp remember.
But these dumbasses are just hanging back half a map away instead of trying to do anything.
Game kinda gives you a group hesitancy.
Teammates unsure whether to brave a choke leaves you unsure yourself.
Ppl rolling into quickplay with a I should really learn Ana for this meta and there's only so much botmatches and firing range can teach you.
Fuckssake people stop playing your rank 5 standard ladder netdecks in flippin wild casual.
BwaS ran into 4 of them while doing my pirates deck. IE I want this quest done so it's pirates and draw.
Well I got murloc paladin plus the tirion equality-consecrate the 2nd consc a turn later.
And just a chain of oh tempo storm said pirates are good so I'll play pirates.
Basically turned off.
I was playing weapon pirates before it was cool!
In wild anyway.
Jesus fuck this team.
They let a trollborn set up a turret on the point while the whole team was alive.
When we were defending.
That tree is just a little too perfect for my tastes.
Clearly nature magic.
Seems pretty druidy to me.
Dear god why does everyone queue for the 3 boss raid and leave after the first boss every time.
This is only on LFR mind and I say this because I need the first and I keep being shunted into groups where he's dead.
Because when they queued beforehand they arrived as replacements on boss 2 so they requeue once they're finished to get credit for the first before leaving.
MoonWolf> +1 for LRT.
But but but.
WHy did they get into that situation too?
Why does it keep happening D8.
People wipe on Guarm and ragequit at 1 stack of determination P.
Well all the groups I've got into they just started the trash immediately after.
After the Odyn fight that is.
Dr. Strange actually a really REALLY long commercial against driving while on your phone.
Actually yeah pretty much.
He was also gannin pretty fuckin quick like.
Not that I wouldn't if I had a fuckin mazerati but that's beside the point.
Also whoever was on the magic circle graphics was on fucking point.
In fact the first 30 minutes so far the whole graphics effects shit has been on point.
You mean the sparkler ones?
Aye they were canny.
MairBear y'all changed the lightbulb in my living room last new year's right?
Those lines are unrelated.
I read the Overwatch comic between them >.>.
MairBear I'm only asking because I had to do it just now and needed to move the table to get up there.
I think that happened.
Wait what other games are now canon gay.
I think it's just Overwatch.
But y'know the internet.
Haven't you heard? Overwatch is all the games now.
I mean Tracer's double-trending.
My team has 2 hogs a maccree and a soldier.
And they cant counter 2 pharahs.
Get me that pharah's battletag so I may learn their ways.
...Join the next game. Second point in eichenwalde we are on defense. there is one enemy pushing the payload so I of course jump on that and keep it for some 10 seconds. Rest of my team is DMing on the ramparts.
Or at least our rein and mercy were.
In the end I have objective gold with 20 seconds. what the fuck was that team doing.
Butt bot.
Khadgar Pls Intensifies.
To quote That was close! I nearly shattered the flow of time itself.. but I think it's better now.
Khadgar please stop doing things.
Just in generally.
Stop doing things.
Torb of the third leg.
One thing that bothered me about overwatch comic The yurinings.
What the hell is hanzo doing here.
Buying a christmas cake.
So why is he lifting? Putting on? that plate.
I want to know why he walks around with a quiver of arrows in casual wear.
Also Oh dear I might have infected Ed with steven universe.
Well that is understandable. gotta be prepared.
Pretty sure he does have enemies even outside of the overwatch cast. What with being the outcast son of an assassin clan.
The kid behind him has seen some shit.
Hanzo probably just murdered a whole lot of people for that cake.
Just ulti'd the queue.
With every death Honor.
Is battle.net down for anyone else?
Alt overwatch servers.
I'm logged into battle.net.
Lemme launch a game.
Seems to be working for me.
Hm. wonder what the issue is at my end then.
Maybe the game got updated. time to launch b.net for a bit I guess.
Yeah it got an update last night.
I still think ana was a mistake.
Outheals mercy in single target and her boost allows genji to apparently survive junk ulti+mine combo if they get any heals.
The only problem with ana is that i can't play her worth a damn.
Dutch Man sets French castle on fire and shoots firefighters.
Not much to her to play decently. stick with group if your tank is taking heavy damage grenade+heal.
You'll be healing 150 or so a second + 100 initial heal from grenade.
Noelor I remember chaging your lightbulb.
The best catte.
Christmas is coming and with it the annual stuff everything into shelves that are out of room and closets event. Which is fine this place was getting a bit too chaotic even for me. I just suspect I probably should use a happier music playlist since its christmas and all.
Topics for the last 3 songs Dying son dead father dead child.
Then again if I listened to finnish christmas songs even then I would not escape this since they coming with classic lines its time for love and joy! Life only lasts but a moment and even that is dark and terrible.
Fucking hceer up finland.
Even your christmas music is depressing.
On Tracer Yes this is so British. Many Chinese call the UK 腐国 “the LGBT country” since many British dramas have Bromance contents.
For some reason I can't copy paste a link anymore >C.
There we go GlennCuddlefish try this instead.
Nope. no. not happening.
I am not spending another year with those stuck in my head.
For a month.
Why get it stuck.
Just use the whole playlist on loop.
But Carol of the Old Ones is a christmas classic.
It is is on that list too! Albeit the wrong version.
I would once again like to point out how much I dislike drawing sugilite. this thing is pointlessly complicated for a modern cartoon character.
Still starting to get the torso if not right then close enough.
Hmm overwatch lists intel hd4400 as minimum GPU I have an hd4000 which is about 25% slower.
Also I'd have to install windows instead of osx.
Hey I might actually finish this thing before christmas.
Nicola Sturgeon is scared of dogs opinion seriously lowered.
They're opportunistic predators anathema.
They have very sharp teeth.
Are you scared of dogs?
They're compassionate pack animals that have co-developed with humanity for millenia.
Both cats and dogs get me.
Get you as in you don't like them?
Or they udnerstand you?
I didn't know we had so many soulless monsters in the channel.
Not my fault they give me this weird sensation in the roof of my mouth whenever I'm around them.
And they're always legging it around with machinations all over me and never revealing them.
....Are people shit talking dogs here.
I don't think so.
I think Noelor is.
I said they're dangerous MoonWolf thinks they're friendly anathema considers liking them to be an indication of soul.
BwaS seems to think they're telepathic?
Nobody thinks they're shit.
That was telepathy then? alright.
Noelor pls tell me it's always the same grunts and I can always pretend to have forgotten them.
Yes but sadly no.
Or at least they stop asking.
Oh no OTS.
What happened to it.
I am uncertain.
So cute seeing all these people running pirate decks cos they're the in thing.
With literally none of the new stuff that's making pirate decks the in thing.
Could just be at the bottom of the deck! ....!
Except yknow the thing comes out of the deck regardless where it is.
Fuck the ocean.
What crime program has the goth scientist?
Whichever one it is my parents are watching it and it is terrible.
NCIS I think.
The original one that is.
Not one of the spin offs.
Nothing better than the BBC telling you you're misremembering your Tudor history.
Or that your history teacher taught it wrong.
Its all lies from top to bottom.
Squall!
Give your girlfriend a hug squall.
Ugh still not enough words.
Time for a paragraph about roll or piece an' sausage.
TMW something on humble bundle cries out as perfect gift for someone you were sure you were done gift shopping for ><.
Anathema piece and sausage is just sliced bread aye?
FUCKING TAVERN BRAWL.
You'd think going there you would be able to escape the /golden standard-legal rank 5 reno mage/.
Might have to redraw the backer right arm other than that I think I can start colouring the character soon. well after cleaning up some of the lines still.
It's definitely Sugilite though.
Like if nothing else the face is pretty much spot-on but afaik without reference the rest is also good.
The rest is a bit off. the head is slightly too large.
The waist should be slightly smaller I think.
Also the shoulder...orbs might be a bit off as well. legs are probably wrong size.
Ok so its all whack but I like it and not changing anything at this point besides maybe that arm.
I mean I assume it's very difficult to draw a Garnet-waist sufficiently narrow while also making its owner look at all reasonable.
She's like an insect.
Ragnarosing intensifies.
Sure but sugilites is not that ridiculous.
I guess Amethyst balances it out?
Like I said not looking at a reference.
My mind goes to Sardonyx far more easily.
Now if you want a ridiculous waist sardonyx takes the cake.
Rotates AND has arms. great.
Actually did the waist part rotate or just the upper torso I forget.
GlennCuddlefish p sure the arms rotate.
For massive hammer swings.
Anathema as you specifically asked for it.
Not going to recommend anyone actually read that it's jargonny as fuck.
Especially if you don't Scottish.
Because then you're at two different overlapping layers of these words are garbage.
Noelor battle royal seems a waste of time this early C.
Because level 50.
It'll be my go-to for getting BPs though way lower stress than Battle Tree.
Yeah kinda dickish for them to flaunt the feature where you're 25 at best.
And you get points even if you lose.
Also to sweep your team first thing every round D.
I'm going to put together a team for it that's something like Toxipex Araquanid ???
Where ??? needs to deal with electrics probably so either a ground or something beefy with EQ.
Huh Arse Creed isn't out in the UK until new years...
Then why have I been fucking reading about its release escapades this last week...
They need to sail over here now though.
Holy shit one of the UBs is the new 3rd-fastest pokémon in the game.
And in keeping with style they're doing it by boat/.
The joke being AC3/Black Flag type boats.
No wonder it's dominating the meta.
Spoilerthing or ?
UBs are spoilers if you're still on the second isle yes.
You'll have seen them in the promo stuff but only with code names.
And idr which.
I was afwul at the promo stuff.
As in all the things I run across are new to me now. Other than that sandcastle.
Someone traded me a ... what was it glowy core thing.
And it feels like everything in alola either evolves or swaps forms.
Ok question for the ages Undo in solitaire cheating Y/N?
And nah there's a handful of things that don't.
GlennCuddlefish it makes you an ethicless monster...
GlennCuddlefish only if they're rationed as a means of difficulty adjustment.
But my grandfather does it to pad his stats.
Like you get 3.
Albeit I've pulled that number out of my arse.
I think its kind of cheating but the button is right there its a basic function in the game.
This would explain why my win rate is like 20%.
I just don't solitaire.
Never figured it out.
Its good for when you are listening to lets plays/streams since it gives something for my hands to do.
Practice BLM rotations D.
That would require my brain as well.
Only for the first months.
I need to do that one of these days just been busy with cleaning and drawing lately.
Nah it still requires attention after that since I have to keep track of cooldowns and buff durations.
Noelor And that is why my dad could Absolutely beat up your dad.
Huh. Hadn't seen the popeye animation test before. Actually looked really good even if the audio side was..not good.
<- good almost lost me as an overwatch fan by making pharah/mercy non cannon.
Face it moonwolf that ship sailed and sank.
What? They obviously havent turned Pharmercy non cannon. Only that Pharah is half-canadian.
And studied engineering.
Angering the gods of sauna? Thats a birching.
This seems somewhat cyclical.
I have one question.
Why is winston so bad at countering anything.
Developers just hate him.
Jfc this last Asuras Wrath update o_o.
Jesus christ why cant I for once get a decent team.
Cooked_Auto And that is why my dad could Absolutely beat up your dad.
I can see that.
Disappointed Mithra didn't just go Kick his ass.
But what we got instead was pretty good too.
How can you have a QTE-off?! HOW?!
Thats exactly how.
It still baffles me how people cant understand the concept of countering anything in this game.
I main support.
I can't counter anything.
Well it's not like the tutorial goes you're 76 this is tracer you're probably going to lose to a tracer.
I usually end up support because nobody else does.
And even then I end up chasing fucking widowmakers because nobody else is doing anything about it.
That's me in general regardless of hero.
Being a 76 its your job to shoot at mercy untill she's dead.
Sorry the mercy's kinda hiding behind a reinhardt wall and a bastion with left click sellotaped down on their mouse.
Not on my team she isn't.
Because WE DONT HAVE ANY TANKS.
Yeah well its not called tankwatch is it.
I blizzard wanted us to play tanks they wouldn't have put snipers in the game.
Now let me play my damage ana main.
How the fuck are my stun grenades not stunning anything.
I've tried throwing them in front of enemies behind enemies in enemies above enemies nothing works.
Try throwing them at enemies.
All of those have been at ultimately.
And why is there always someone who locks into goddamn widowmaker instantly every match.
Pls what MairBear ?
Pls pwn the enemy ? i will!
My kd is 51 at the end of the 15 minute match because i'm just so good.
Also i never left the starting point.
Dying in starting point what a scrub.
Well that round we had a tank.
Who walked to the enemy spawn and idled there.
Why do I bother with this game.
Who walked to the enemy spawn and idled there <- AHAHAHAHAHA.
Anathema apparantly someone is ddosing the hell out of poe.trade and its killing the game.
A Caganer is a figurine depicted in the act of defecation appearing in nativity scenes in Catalonia.
The more you know.
Haha really? <- yup.
Is there a write-up somewhere?
I just read a reddit thread complaining about it.
Tried to be strategic with brawl got screwed opponent conceded anyway.
I tried to dump bodies on the board and use the gain empty mana for each critter so I could skip from 3 to 6 mana. But forgot the brawl reacted on turn number not mana number.
MairBear can i fight you in HS for 80 golds ?
Certainly the oddest D3 drop I've gotten so far.
Its quite good for leveling.
I meant more the orange bonus in this case.
I was horribly confused for a second when I saw the first two.
Well that happened. killed everyone with my d.va ult.
Including the blue team?
Oh how I wish.
Don't we all.
Some game on the steam sale calling itself toxikk sic a throwback to 90's arena shooters.
So much so I'm pretty sure one of the maps they use on the trailer is literally Deck 17 from UT.
I mean if you have to copy a map.
A great dog.
Well this episode of flip flappers felt kind of fillerish.
Next episode back to evangelion.
Fillerish episodes in the middle of evangelion sounds pretty evangelion to me.
Also the preview for the next episode was a mess. But I suspect its just the storyboard for the next episode so I am not going to look into it in case of spoilers.
Noelor omg the fire trial.
The latest shantae does have some nice art assets.
Also the music is great so far same composer did music for shovel knight and mighty switch force among other things.
The music was good enough that I now have extra ringing in my ears it seems.
MairBear it's great.
It says normal/fighting.
But I refuse to believe Stufful isn't a ghost. Because those are unfriendly dex entries.
Dunno why you'd think ghost from them.
I keep thinking it's Fairy/Fighting.
I mean only that it looks adorable at first. And then the dex outright calls it dangerous.
But I mean same applies to Pancham.
Cler/Monk multiclass.
I want access to this database.
3d kung fu archives.
Oh latest Grand Tour episode is in Lapland.
Polygon front page banner. Left column steam winter sale now live. Right column yes steam is down for everyone.
I'd say they are related but i think its probably just a massive ddos.
Ah yes some kid lost at siesgoh again.
Well I like that the GT guys managed to kill their celebrity guest in the most finnish way possible.
MoonWolf path of exile? O.
I hear the latest league is good wish I had time to play it.
I'm playing it becuase it looks like D3 is in just add another 2 legenadies for the new season and thats about it mode.
Going to see if the poe endgame is worth anything.
It totes is >_>.
And that was the latest shantae. Good if short.
Sounds par for the course.
Peeps with WoW subs anyone fancy doing a few keystone mythics of a relatively low tier in a few mins?
Anathema i found my first unique WHAT ?
MoonWolf yeah it's pretty odd.
There is a niche self-cursing build.
But why ?
There's an item or something that gives you a bonus per curse on you.
21 chapters into the game.
Geop discovers the no-sell mode in Asura's Wrath.
Also welcome to black and white cubeskull hell I guess?
Blegh local friends xmas party where my alcohol intake for 1 night is greater than 1 regular month.
Meanwhile I went to a friend's late-december-birthday party last week and got as stoned as I've been in my life.
So 'tis the season I guess.
Oh my noelor getting stoned.
You fuckin rebel.
Btw I'm-a stream Undertale tomorrow afternoon for a friend if anyone else wants to come hang out.
Goddamnit anime! You were supposed to update 4 hours ago!
DO NOT MAKE MY BINGING BE FOR NAUGH BY LEAVING ME HANGING.
Sadly I will be out first eating with family and then drinking with friends tomorrow.
In my case it'll just be dinner with family and then some boardgames after the gifts. Thats about it for me tomorrow.
Well goddamnit now I have no idea what I should watch. maybe I'll catch up to nanbaka..or maybe I'll finally watch ancient norwegian worms to get my friend off my back.
Bahaha would take me days to get through my current queue even if I binged.
What I've been binging has been stuff from this season alone today.
Would be more if netflicks hadn't taken FMA off...
Well this plan might take longer than I expected. the season 1 torrent is downloading at blazing 35KB/s.
BwaS wait whaaaaat!?
You mean I'm gonna have to take out and insert disks when I want to binge it again? C.
How do you think I feel I'd only worked up to about ep 10.
All I have left now is code geese.
Also in bullshit dva ults news of the day.
Things it can penetrate with blast radius a fucking bus.
Guess I might as well borrow nichibros while I am downloading backlog.
How did I miss this one.
Well that was random and very unexpected. My brother just gifted me Witcher 3 GOTY on steam and I'm not sure if I should give something back or not >_>.
Noelor the cutest princess.
Can somebody please check if is working for me?
I no longer have a preview on my dash.
You appear to be playing metro.
You're not talking so i can't comment on music vs voice.
But its making sounds.
That sounds alright.
Perhaps music is a little loud.
As in if i want to hear your voice at a level i prefer i'd have to turn the stream volume a bit louder than i'd prefer for background music stuff.
If that makes any sense to you.
Its not the biggest deal.
I have played the game back when it was a flash demo.
It doesn't appear to have changed much its just prettier.
Thats what i use HS for.
Your light blue line is in some problems.
If only metros worked like this in real life yous station was overcrowded for half a week SHUT IT DOWN.
No more metro lines for anyone.
Find a new manager.
Ok so if I'm streaming Undertale as pacifist when do I turn around to go on dates?
Right at the end?
I don't have undertale routes memorized.
I'm-a see if I can find a map.
Lemme know when you actually go live.
It'll be another hour or so.
Ok so if you do pacifist through from the start you don't fight Asgore.
If you fight Asgore you also have to fight Omega Flowey and witness the neutral end.
So it's down to whether or not I wanna show off those two bosses.
On the one hand they are cool Omega Flowey especially.
On the other hand they're very difficult.
Pacifist alone is already difficult enough.
No mercy is more so.
But also dull most of the way through.
Yeah you failed that one >.>.
I did because that version of Undyne truly is Undying.
Tbh if you are showcasing the game I would go with pacifist route since that is what makes the game more unique.
Also you know has the best boss track in the game.
GlennCuddlefish oh absolutely.
But you can do a neutral route and then reload in New Home to do the dates.
What I'll do I think is play through to New Home and then decide whether or not to fight Asgore based on the time.
Remove the rain and I might like this christmas weather.
How much sun you get today?
Since I live on the south coast I get plenty.
And by plenty I mean about 6 hours.
Of course since I woke up around 1pm its more like 2 hours.
MoonWolf I'm-a start around half past after I grab some lunch.
D'you want to hang on mumble or just watch? mumble will probably be broadcast because I cba to make my virtual audio cable work.
Man that hog must be mad.
Hooked my pharah got shot into the well.
This is after he has been trying to hunt me down for half a round.
D'you want to hang on mumble or just watch? mumble will probably be broadcast because I cba to make my virtual audio cable work <- mumble is fine.
What was the link to the stream?
D'you want to hang on mumble or just watch? mumble will probably be broadcast because I cba to make my virtual audio cable work.
MoonWolf got a recommended user agent plugin for firefox?
You need to change yours ?
Apparantly I can get netflix to work if I enable drm content in preferences and spoof a chrome user agent.
You are very quiet Noelor.
A little the game is still louder though.
Aye that's better.
Confession I never finished undertale and now I have lost my save.
Confession I never bought it.
Confession Never going to buy it.
Adventures in holiday tech support beginning.
How do I make MS Word go landscape in a version of MS Word that you don't run?
Rotate monitor 90 degrees.
It's incredibly hard to take a picture of a black dog sitting on a black sofa.
Yes I imagine as much.
MairBear I'm live on streaming Undertale fyi =.
Ah not murder training yet then.
Stupid mumble V.
GlennCuttlefish GlennCuttlefish GlennCuttlefish.
They are finally adding he best kind of mage to FFXIV.
Also addin naga it seems.
This is the best.
Lovely parents managed to pop a fuze and I forgot to save my progress on something I was working with in photoshop v.
People seem to be getting 5 free lootboxes in overwatch for christmas?
Can you confirm?
Can you confirm?nce me sister to let me use her computer for a bit if I need to actually win a game p.
I'll go check.
Anathema you get them for logging in.
Got sombras and winstons christmas skins.
Caves of Qud seems interesting but the keybinds are not good for laptops even the laoptop mode.
Beyond the 'snowbrawl + hanamura/kingsrow + 9 wins arcade' 5 boxes?
Just login now get 5 boxes.
I got 3 epics.
Got one of the epic event skins but was a duplicate =P.
Ty for the heads up.
MairBear would you like to see some videos of a Poorly Made FE7 romhack?
I found them funny but ymmv depending on how well you remember the original.
Noelor link away though can't check for a while.
For an extra bit of context the group streaming it have previously attempted their own FE7 romhack.
Among other games.
So they can work out exactly what gets fucked up and how.
MoonWolf but BLM is already in the game?
Goddamnit I wasn't going to login right now but free loot boxes?
Woo tracer legendary skin in the first one.
Woo patchi reindeer icon in the third.
I got a ginger-pachimari icon.
I think I now have all the patchi christmas icons.
Observant fella our Squall.
MoonWolf but BLM is already in the game? red mage though.
TIL 'championship manager' and 'football manager' have never been concurrent or competitor series.
And were only just a series name change due to publisher rights whoops.
Uuuurgh learned tonight there is a slight chance I might be related to Donald Trump.
Shame its not enough to do what Hitlers brother did.
Uuuurgh learned tonight there is a slight chance I might be related to Donald Trump <- rip.
Urgh why do I keep thinking i can deal with a week of my family.
Mirey Crumbles to all.
Mairy christmas to you too.
Nsfl it's just text but uh wtf.
I walked into that one.
Yeah I gave you plenty warning on that.
Latest poppy speaks true.
Art is suffering?
Yes. and only depressed weirdoes are into it.
Hurray finally the rest of the family got off their backsides and decided where/when/how they wanted to go see Rogue 1.
Was there a second season to jormungand?
Didn't actually see all of it either. Dunno why v.
D'aww port halfway through australia's big boxing day boat race have a consolation prize for teams who have to bow out cos they've bust their.
So far its a decent series I just wish some of the characters were a bit more flawed.
It has some great moments if anything that I have to replicate in an RPG campaign despite having played Shadowrun for at least a year or more now.
Dont get involved with flying yep sounds like my RPG group.
Welp 2016 claims another one.
George Michael damn.
Like in my view he's a bit of a has-been and had a bit of a run in with drugs but still.
Good god what a team that was.
Healed until halfway of the round then got tired of their shit figured I'd try snping since I suck at it.
Still ended with gold elims.
Yeah not even remotely keen on braving OW on this night of all nights.
Matchmaker even more fucked than usual trying to deal with fresh faces who got it for xmas.
At least in quick play I dont think I saw a single low level player.
With their hurr durr oh shit I need a battletag oh well I'll call myself krusher99 cos it's still 1998 innit.
All things considered krushes99 is on the low end of bad names.
Lack of X's and random capitals.
And referencing existing popular culture or making anti-semitic statements yes I know.
Or their SAO waifu.
Always a classic.
At least you're not playing WarThunder. Then it'd be Strike Witches and Nazis.
I could get behind garupan on world of tanks maybe.
Pretty sure you could see that in WT as well considering tank mode.
And then when the boat mode comes out And World of Warships fucking Kancolle *everywhere*.
Where there's a fucking lot of boat girls to choose from I know.
? GOTY mod.
That... Her Majesty's Ship Her Majesty rather sounds like she's aussie S.
It kinda does yes.
Its an attempt at least.
Haven't heard Iowa's voice lines otoh.
Nvm they go with straight Japanese.
I wonder if in that 'anime' lootcrate what magnitude of viewers will be like ah yes X that's on my anime shelf a fine choice!
Didnt look into that.
GlennCuttlefish this is important.
I need a link to one of those pictures from that horse game.
Sadly I was in bed by the time that request came in.
You've ruined mairbears very important thing.
I hope you feel bad.
Guess I will just have to leave a note then wont i.
I guess you will.
!note MairBear.
!note MairBear.
Is that horse smoking?
There are some NCIS episodes with Kirstin Wiig in them maybe that is the best bad detective show then.
Yes he is noelor.
Boat waifu still seems very silly.
Still other than /admairəl/ which wtf that HMS England sounded Englisher than Tracer tbh.
All of my subreddits are completely unusable today.
'ambassadors' taking it upon themselves to wish seasons greetings to competitor subs.
Regardless of the majority opinion of festive goodwill.
Noelor shipgirls are very serious.
Oh yodo dess!
My shipgirls property of choice has more giant fuckoff gravity cannons though.
And actual ships.
I prefer the Chuunibote instead.
Manga not so much anime.
Anime goes very off the rails about halfway through.
Like just leaves canon behind to go have a beach episode.
And then giant laser battles won by the power being more shounen.
Which is not... very ... in keeping with the spirit of the manga.
Where its all about plots and plans and good strategy.
And not so much who can shout louder while shooting a giant beam.
MoonWolf> well it does /this/ halfway through so yeah off the rails indeed.
Why do these boats have tribal tats?
Spoilers they're probably not even really boats.
Nobody knows whats up with them for real but they just decided to Look like WW2 era boats.
They're AI weapons made out of reconfigurable nano material.
The more they start using bullshit technology things the more they start glowing.
Like a submarine parting the sea like fucking moses and splitting in half to reveal a fuck off massive lascannon.
I'm watching Tie's stream of Pokémon Uranium.
This game is weeeeird.
That sounds like a legitimate real pokemon game made by gamefreak.
It is not even a romhack.
It's made in RPGmaker.
The water starter has Static for... reasons?
Because its going to gain an electricy type later ?
But starters always have the same abilities.
Exciting options changing action.
That boost the damage of their starter type when on low health.
They're not very good.
But let's say your rival ends up with this one.
Now you get paralysed on like turn 1 of the first battle in the game.
Oh hadn't thought about it that way.
Yeah that'd be garbage.
Static is busted basically.
Guess we know how pokemon uranium thinks about difficulty then.
You could give the starters other abilities but try to stick to that power level.
Ie pretty good but very situational.
Noelor so lets say you were making a custom pokemon game.
Nobody is going to play this whithout having alreayd played another pokemon game right. why the fuck would they start with your fangame that makes no sense.
I mean it's on the level of bootlegs.
Do you then go through all the standard stations of professor monologue house stuff tutorial starting village stuff.
At least its not Pokemon Quartz.
Or do you skip all that shit and just get it over with pick your starter fight your rival and go ?
Okay pokemon uranium.
You are taking this story thing WAY to seirously.
SMT its pokemon with satans.
Raptorch its a lizard looking fire starter.
Didn't we do that one already.
This is just marginally differently coloured charmander.
I think they all are basically.
Rival battle watergun your rivals fire pokemon win instantly.
This part was not well thought through.
And then your rival acts like a whiny asshole.
Caves of Qud would be at least 50% more fun if it did not frequently lock up ~_~.
Anathema it adds to the roguelike charm.
Well the debug options let you enable saving so I did that.
Such a cheater.
It's really good the opengl backend has great atmospheric music.
Also you find an 'weird artifact' examine it and get 'you have made some progress identifying `thermal grenade mk1`'.
Matchday programme cock-up he got the sack this week.
Boot up mii plaza.
A guy shows up and yells Panties! on a speech bubble with horizontal blue and white stripes.
Because of course.
Sure. Why not.
Why not indeed.
What did you even need the pictures for mair?
I don't understand the UBs.
There is one made of bamboo which is Steel/Flying.
And one made of swords and origami which is Steel/Grass.
Nice thing about gen 7 it's the first generation not to require actually every pokémon for completion of the pokédex.
Because they don't upgrade it to a national version ie one with actually all the pokémon.
So completion requires a mere 300 of the now 800 pokémon in existence.
So I got this cute Sombra top from the Blizzard store.
Just one problem.
Sombra's hair asymmetry is the opposite direction to mine.
Wear it inside out then.
Alas there are seams.
Off to family for the next few days~.
!note Noelor.
If you give me a map of the dungeon that should mean none of the rooms that are not secret should remain hidden on the map.
How come I end up in teams that just cant understand the importance of shooting symmetra.
And never against them.
Nah I've had a couple of games where I got gold kills as symmetra because nobody shot me.
Damn. only silver that match.
Would have gotten it if the rein didn't get a lucky streak at the final second.
We understand the importance of shooting symmetra.
She just has a small hitbox is hidden behind a turret nest and when we get close enough for a good aim she's already void ray'd us.
Either I'm woefully misunderstanding this anime...
Or there's a scene in code geass that opens with a lass jacking off to a tableleg.
Oooh yeah pretty sure its that girl who has borderline psycho crush on the Britannian princess.
Or maybe it was for her upperclassman. Can't remember exactly.
Jesus christ what is this torrent raw blu-ray files?
25 gigs for a season? How about no.
Well based on the first episode people who claim nichibros is better than nichijou are plebeians who have absolutely no taste.
Nah its pretty good I just prefer nichijou so far. It has that nonsensical humor and better animation and cast for me.
Welp decided to do a random cache run in D3. Didn't expect finding a rainbow goblin almost instantly v.
32% kill asssists angry lucio is always fun.
I like this new symmetra. gold elims and PotG again.
Right time to finally start eating the christmas leftovers in th.
Well the tracer/emily cosplay didn't take long.
Suprisngly out of russia.
Evolved A Froslass.
Ironically according to the pokédex she has no chill.
The faction system in CoQ is great just encountered a hyenaman 'hated by /unshelled reptiles/ for disproving a famous theorum'.
GlennCuttlefish overwatch decided i needed to be edgier and gave me the reaper winter skin.
Its okay though i got the one thing i wanted out of winter the symmetra potg animation.
Discovered today that I could jump up to Expert difficulty in D3 without issue well except whenever there's arcane enchants going off but fuck those in general.
RIP Carrie Fisher.
Legit think I hate my brother now.
Meanwhile I gifted mine Stardew Valley today as an early birthday present and as a slight thanks for giving me Witcher 3 GOTY.
As I've mentioned I've been playing Caves of Qud a lot recently and it's making me want to try and develop a roguelike based on Dark Heresy.
Cooked_Auto urgh what I need to go somewhere in person to get the re-print of Rogue Trader? that's bum.
Hmm Jan 2nd.
I have friends staying that are driving back then wonder if I can convince them to drop me off in Nottingham on their way back to Glasgow.
Anathema Well you could just buy an old book of ebay if you so like.
There's plenty of them there.
I mean they've always done WHW exclusives there is a set of Space Marine vehicles you can only get there for instance.
One of my friends has an old copy but the pages are falling out.
<- sounds about right even if the vodka might be a bit much.
Well at least they were not letters demanding more tax ?
Including UK contribution to the EU budget as a tiny sliver just to take the piss.
Yeah that's nice.
Anyway the other is an invoice from FedEx for my Blizzard delivery earlier in the month.
UK contribution to the EU budget <- tax deparment sniping at the sitting goverment ?
MoonWolf lil bit.
It's like the smallest item probably wasn't on last year's return I didn't keep it to check.
It's 1%ish based on the numerical breakdown.
It should've been in other but not this year.
Does this mean genderqueer people who date any other genders are heterosexual? DOES IT lol.
Can we replace gay and straight with purely attraction based words instead of gender-and-preference words ?
They're getting clunky.
I tend to.
Because of course I do.
Can we beam this as normal into everyone elses head too ?
That's a cute thought.
Talking of cute.
I can't enjoy this comic because the title is horrible.
I didn't even.
Read the title ?
Remember when we had the mages with only portals in their deck brawls.
Now we have mages with many different kinds of portal in their deck brawl.
MoonWolf you want a link for part 2 of Tie's Uranium stream?
I saw enough of that game.
Well that was jormungand.
Season 1 was decent enough season 2 got better right until the big reveals and ending. Which was just bad.
Sudden uncharted plot twist.
Nobody could see something shady with your brother coming.
Noelor and then umi's dragon evolved into a mech and shoved itself into its heart.
Noelor what is your TOA again.
MairBear did you get the part where I'm arriving at lunchtime Saturday?
I want an exact time so I can sync tho.
Can't help you with that.
Try a phone based communication method ?
I can wait.
Phones are overrated.
They're quite convenient.
Well last night thye didn't ping me until 5am on a message from 3pm.
What kind of software designed by satan are you using for your messages.
And somehow even that freezes less than windows.
Nah windows has been pretty good at not just randomly dying since windows 7.
Quick someone give me $20 so I can fund.
<-- It's ya boii!
Noelor plz no.
Cooked_Auto rip mercy.
Noelor is 12.55 an eta?
Noelor when leaving.
Sat 0735 - newcastle 1255 - winchester.
Mon 1403 - winchester 2001 - newcastle.
Sorry I had to go into town to deposit my £73 of coinage before the year ends.
GlennCuttlefish it'd actually be $40 because it's +$20 to ship to Europe.
Well there went my hopes of ever affording it.
Noelor do they... not accept coins between years?
I should do that stupid jangly metal bits.
MairBear had to in this case means for my own satisfaction.
Noelor Hau is really ... one of a kind.
Hau is not quite Lilly.
Who is a Purest Cinnamon Bun.
But Hau is still an adorable precious child.
There's a consistent aesthetic to this outfit it's... Matador Kefka? Lightning Returns is a beautiful video game.
Also this I suppose.
Matador Kefka was but with a beret for what it's worth.
Disappointed by the lack of makeup.
Wow youtube's layout is awful for streams.
Okay me and Noelor are on the same trains MairBear.
Watched a bit of a stream of Black Closet reminding me of the greatest line in that game.
MairBear if I bring my PS4 is there something to plug it into.
I think he said he has one already.
But that doesn't have my horrifying number of hours FF15 save on it.
Also i got that cowboy flicking game for Christmas.
The Doom boardgame did not arrive however.
I will bring the cowboy flicking.
I'm-a bring Spyfall and Beyond Baker Street.
Codenames if I have room.
What are the two I haven't played.
Beyond Baker Street is a co-op card game in which you can see everyone else's hands but not your own.
Codenames is a team word game.
Which is why it's a maybe idk how much of Mair's family is about and willing to play card games with us.
ChaosSmurf I have one already.
I might avert my eyes though as I'd not want to spoil BoyBandAdventures.
Noelor I do already have a spyfall o.
If you wish to free bag space.
That was promising to be awkward to pack.
If I brought my PS3 controller would it work on PS4 games?
Are there even multiplayer games to play?
Also do you a wiiu MairBear?
Noelor I do not.
PS4 360 still present just needs plugs to be swapped.
We have 2 controllers here at least and all the games I have support at most 2 players locally alas.
WHich is mostly fighters mostly 2d some 3d.
My brother is going to be present btw and will instigate/join in some winner-stays-on type stuff.
How close is your PC to a tv?
With compatible ports/cables.
Well my main monitor touches the TV.
However placing laptops/things around might require some juggling and even seperate rooms...
Considering gifting you one of the jackboxes on steam.
If we can actually set it up.
Quite viable. Could even use my steam on my dads pc if we wanted it in a more living room area.
Also one of you gets a double bed one of you gets to climb a ladder to a loft space.
Oh Noelor also it's going to be 3 of us plus you two and all would be game for card/board games. Allowing for uptake and ability.
My dad struggles with Spyfall but enjoys it for example.
Oh wait I'm being silly I can just buy it and then log into steam on your pc.
Make sure you have a way to get the steamguard code though v.
Oh the 4 digit code it generates when you log into a new device. I speak from experience of ana's. I tried to log into steam it sent an email to my steam's mail address. I couldn't access it for reasons. Had to text my dad to look up the thing.
You have wifi right?
Then I can get emails.
Speed is good for out in the country. Which is to say almost definitely a sight slower than your own.
Point being if you want to download things it's far better to do it at home than here.
I can't download games onto your pc from here =P.
Oh wasn't sure if laptopping.
I do not own such a computer any more.
Either sold or donated my last one to ChaosSmurf.
Bah all these great multiplay games and none of them support hot seat.
Never felt the need for another.
Just download HOMM3 or something P.
On the front lines of the war there is a little girl. Blond hair blue eyes and porcelain white skin she commands her squad with lisping voice. Her name is Tanya Degurechaff. But in reality she is one of Japan's most elite salarymen reborn as a little girl thats certainly one anime pitch.
Not a VN?
I mean you could just download HoMM3 or Civ and play hotseat in that.
Civ up to... 4? maybe even 3.
And yes that is a very anime pitch.
My friend from work is very not smart.
He asked me which Star Wars to watch first so I told him to watch in Machete order.
Then described Machete order repeatedly.
So he messaged me earlier telling me he was watching ep1.
Having just watched ep6.
And I was like oh you decided to just watch in release order?
Oh sorry I thought you'd typed it wrong.
Never actually made a machete order watch yet.
He hadn't seen any of them yet.
Was the thing.
Oh hey Kingdoms of Amalur is down to a fiver.
I am successfully on train.
Dramatic hair cutting scene.
I am successfully on train <- YAY.
The WiFi is not up to YouTube sadly.
Not a suprise.
MoonWolf I legit love the haircut as a dramatic device >.>.
I'm kinda obsessed with hair though so.
This one feels overdone.
Before this train set off there was an announcement.
'bout what ?
Please be aware there are two trains on this platform - we are not going to Glasgow.
Unless you want to visit gimble last minute.
Just as good for the people who do want to go to Glasgow honestly.
Such as the only other person to appear in my carriage.
All the space.
I'm assuming the other carriages have people.
Also it's a long trip they'll probably accrue as we go.
How long actually ?
Trains are nice? that way.
Exact time of arrival is a couple pages up I pasted it last night.
I like that public transit exists. I don't like that its full of strangers.
But like 5.5h?
Thats a loong ride.
All one ride though!
No getting off and onto a tube and then a different train for me!
I don't think i'd mind a transfer with a 15 minute break in there.
It's the tube transfer honestly.
Like if it were just a change in London KX with a half hour wait or whatever sure.
But an hour between arrival in KX before leaving from London P and needing to tube in that time with my luggage and in all my layers.
Yeah fuck that.
Also wow this WiFi is not even up to downloading podcasts.
Defs should have done that at home silly yesterday-Noelor.
!note Minister.
Ultra Beasts are p cool honestly.
There are like 2 or 3 I just don't like?
This train turned around at some point.
Because I was riding backwards when I left Newcastle and am now riding forwards.
I'm just going to hope we're still headed mainly southwest I guess.
And assume this was somehow a side effect of stopping in one of the stations along the way.
Birmingham most likely.
MoonWolf still unable to stream a YouTube but was that video actually less bad than the thumbnail led me to believe?
Stone cold.
Oh hey theres a stream for this years gaki no tsukai batsu games.
Also japanese commercials continue to be strange I see.
I need to get this video afterwards and screencap all the ITS A SCIENCE scenes.
Well I was planning on seeing if my cough has let up but those last 2 segments made me laugh so much I've been coughing no matter what.
!note Noelor and then matthew colville posted an hour long video thats basically 4th edition its probably better than 5th.
Happy new years.
Happy new year nerds.
Watch a good video for 2017.
We played Drawful Fred is Mair's dad.
See professional games journalist.
Also happy 2017 y'all.
!note Noelor.
MairBear is it the winner or is it a shaman totem.
MairBear> happy new year to all of you in... winchester is it?
Holy shit a new episode of Hellsing Ultimate Abridged.
Sadly I didnt think the new hellsing abridged episode was that good.
Ps you're wrong but okay.
Well I never.
BwaS reciprocations from last night btw I just had a fleeting visit to keys last night.
Cooked_Auto someone its a small team.
Also i've legit tracked that project for years >.>.
Levels of my surprise 0.00%.
I did NOT realize it was out.
Hey it was released two days ago.
I don't literally visit the homepage every fucking day.
Its been going for like 8 years.
Clearly not doing a very good job at tracking it.
GlennCuttlefish Noelor's about to try and play Targer.
Also this is Smurf hi.
MairBear> hi smurf.
How'd it go MairBear smurf or noelor.
A smurf shirt.
!note Noelor inoreader.
Nier 2 weapon stories ar estill a thing.
Also your UI elements are equipement.
You can unequip your healthbar.
Or your ability to be alive.
So you can challenge yourself.
This game looks hella good.
And thre better be a darkid and chip cheezum lp.
And then the boss was a giant robot!
Why not just play it yourself?
No console to do so with.
Wasn't it getting a pc release as well?
I mean its either getting a pc release or Taro is messing with us again.
Turns out the pc release is a completly different game.
You have to play both and then import your save from one to the other to get the last ending.
It sounds like a joke but Nier had two fucking different protagonists.
For the west we'll just give them a DIFFERENT NIER.
And I'm glad they did.
Dad nier > brother nier.
Alright time to climb for 2 hours before i can start doing my job.
That is tall enough for even me to go D.
Thats the third cup you encoldened today!
That's what microwaves are for Glenn.
I am not going to microwave my coffee.
I have my pride.
GlennCuttlefish whence this recent minecraft addiction ?
Wouldnt call it addiction.
Just started a new server with a couple of friends 2 days ago.
So you are.
MoonWolf how incredibly unsurprising.
Wub wub wub.
MairBear ty for reminding me just how incredibly urbanised I am.
I am now home where I don't actually need to switch any of my lights on to get about.
As opposed to Mair's house where the last light goes off and I'm Actually Blind.
Because they don't have ambient light ?
....I have been fooled by tortillas.
I figured I'd have tortillas for dinner.
But then it turns out those were not tortillas but in fact pizza.
MoonWolf quite so.
GlennCuttlefish I feel like that's a story about pizzas fooling you.
But either way such deception should not stand.
Time for a war on pizza and/or tortillas.
Ah but you see that brand is usually just tortillas and tortilla related products.
Ah I see.
War on Tortillas Inc then.
I'll be honest. this is a bad pizza.
GlennCuttlefish that's what you get for buying a pizza from a tortillist I guess.
I suspect i would have been better off not falling for the pizza trickery the first one I had was a decent tortilla.
Apparantly all the episodes in the next stevenbomb have leaked.
Guess i'm watching that later.
They were not kidding about AR2's hard mode being hard.
Its fucking devestating.
Dear google What good is your picture search if EVERYTHING LINKS TO GODDAMN PINTEREST ANYWAY.
Because they're really good at grabbing essentially everything that's uploaded.
GlennCuttlefish i agree.
Can anyone tell if this is or is supposed to be a particular character?
A Mobile Suit from one of the latest Gundam series apparently.
Also look slike the general style of the superrobotwars games ?
By the way Vessel folded as evinced by the fact this needs to be pointed out because nobody has watched anything on it in a year.
Ie after all their free trials ran out and nobody actually wanted to pay what they were charging.
So I finally got to try out the nier automata demo a couple of days ago.
I now know my GOTY for 2017.
That was fast.
So would any Exalted people know any good houserules for making thaumaturgy a bit cheaper? For Ex2.5 that is.
Not a house rule but easily overlooked is that if you have a rank of thaumaturgy you get all rituals of... either that rank or the rank below I forget - for free.
Huh. a new map in overwatch.
That the one with Quakey jump pads?
Didnt see any at least but I was mostly holding the point.
Well that was fun. my team was 2 completely randoms with 2 2stacks.
Up against a 4stack and 2stack.
That seems unfair.
Isn't it supposed to at least match the 4 against another 4 ?
Thats that I thought.
GlennCuttlefish I'll come get angry with you in a few if you're still going.
Sorry just stopped.
MairBear do you want to go explore glorious retrovision d3 with me tomorrow ?
I thought it was patching tonight.
Well its either tomorrow or friday.
I meant the d1 tribute event.
Not the season.
Tbh I dunno. Haven't heard a set date for it.
If we don't need season for it then sure.
Featuring udnertale music.
I do love how the latest OW made matchmaking worse.
Stay as team now the maker is bloated with awkward 2-6 man parties of dodged up MMR that need some plates to be juggled.
It had good intentions!
Ah the good old Do The Thing! demand.
In a 5 dps 1 healer comp.
Hey he's filling the lone-wolf team-leader roles at the same time!
So why is the winter event still going?
So I found a treasure goblin in WoW. Punched it it dropped some charms as in stat boosts while in bag charms opened a portal to the cow level. And the cow king gave me a guitar to play 30s worth of Tristram theme.
And it's ...
A 66min 6 second cooldown.
Of course it is.
Noo winter is over.
Only reason I am kind of annoyed is because I could have actually gotten more stuff if I had known I had this long to save.
Ah well did end up getting the zarya emote on a last second box.
I don't fucking get it I have all those hanzo pricks blocked and muted and I still get their attack ping spam in my ears.
McCrees spamming heal me and being precision perfect at keeping me out of LoS.
Join an in progress quick play game. Find out why in the first 5 seconds from leaving spawn v.
4 of our team doing their sitting emotes behind a wall in a circle.
Well I see Blizz haven't improved on their map design yet.
What we put in this random room? maybe a health pack nah - A FUCKING SHISHA DOODAD!
Let's keep adding tonnes of arbitrary juts and corners to our walls.
So every strafe and backpedal traps you in a fire corridor.
!note anathema.
The 'stay as team' wouldn't do be so bad if it didn't very strongly attempt to match groups against other groups.
Anathema btw killed merciless malachai yesterday.
Also why? p.
Or did they add a reward to him?
Getting the quest to stop being there on the right side ?
GlennCuttlefish this should make you marginally less angry at overwatch ?
No more getting pulled around two corners right in front of roadhog.
Next they can fix dva's ult to stop it propagating around corners.
Apparantly the new overwatch brawl is... playing games of oasis.
That sure is a brawl.
A way to learn the new map i suppose.
But of course new map same old meta.
Hey you know what works on koth? 0 tanks stacking snipers nil engage potential.
Death spectating = widow on a fucking trampoline.
Sure thats nice now how about fixing the actually broken things like ana.
In fact just remove ana.
GlennCuttlefish hates old ladies.
I hate old ladies who have the most bullshit CC in the game can prevent heals on enemy team and heals more than mercy on singletarget.
You forgot the part where she turns rein into a murdertrain.
I am startging to think I can live witht hat part.
Because you know what counters that?
If they put OW game design and balance into HOTS the devs would get an aneurysm.
Yeah in HOTS the heroes are supposed to start OP then get nerfed into normalish.
Its better for sales.
They don't sit around OP as long as what symm is doing though.
Symm is fine.
My favourite PotG is when my friend nano-boosted me as symmetra and I melted EVERYONE.
I got to be boostio for about 3 seconds today.
Probably misfired though.
So fast though.
I thought they removed movement speed from nano boost?
Symm is fine <-.
She needs a skin called Asymmetra.
Considering her robot arm she's already assymetrical.
Wtb D.Va animated short.
Hits were that the next one is lucio.
So probably going to be waiting a while longer.
Oh no its game night tonight isn't it.
I wonder which one is wrong because my local weather station says its 5 degrees colder than that.
Local services are almost universally going to be more accurate.
When you're at minus 13 I don't think taking another 5 off changes much.
...great. forecast for friday is -24c.
Then again at least I live in the south its -37 in lapland atm.
Lapland more like freezeland.
Yep it was kinda cold out there.
!note MairBear fyi you can just *catch* the other version's Lycanroc in the postgame.
I was also sure you could rename pokemon from other trainers as long as yhey weren't nicknamed by that trainer.
I don't *think* so?
But I think because I got a Japanese bounsweet it won't let me rename it even though it got renamed to Steenee and Tsareena.
Nah afaik it's just you can only rename if trainer ID matches.
So if you want a Tsareena of your own you'll have to breed for it.
So cant get exp boost from trading -and- rename it C.
No but you can get the affection xp boost at least.
I'm watching a crocheting stream.
My FitBit thinks I'm running.
Oh wait games in a hour not now right?
If I'm understanding correctly FFXI now also has a pokémon minigame?
If you mean XI I have no idea if you mean the one what I played last I checked it was non-combat pet moba.
I mean XIV yes.
Oh non-combat pets.
But you command armies of your minion pet things to beat up another player's. And to destroy a crystal thing to win.
I am playing The Binding of Isaac I'm sorry.
My FitBit thinks I'm running <- fitbit crochet counter!
YouTube streaming has weird bots.
.... bots ?
Like view inflating bots ?
Or chatbots ?
Paraphrasing You seem so intelligent why are you wasting your time begging for views? If I gave you $1 million would you stop?
Savjz v warlock on renomage gonna mulligan out my reno not needed in this matchup assumes reno.
T1 void t2 peddler t3 igb oh shit it's zoo.
Turned out to be reno.
Trial of valor LFR 3 stacks of determination on Odyn. S.
Determination is powerful.
You look at the skeletons of your dead friends it fills you with determination ?
Quest Play 15 overload cards. Make a deck that is just tunnel trogg lava shock and that one quiraji that unlocks... and overload.
Win 3 games in a row... cos shaman is fair.
Shaman isn't even remolty fair anymore.
Priest had to entomb tunnel trogg.
And drew a 1/3 when he had nothing in his hand.
Deck like that is fine.
Until it snowballs against you and you're always 1 mana of overload behind your next card.
<- holy shit a perfectly functional roborosewater card.
Gaaay spiders.
Someone wrote down Zeal of Zebras in c15 for a laugh as first thing that came into their head.
We're kinda locked in to this I'm afraid.
Basically how standardised English works yes.
Zebra seem horsey enough they should just be a Herd ?
Nah 'cos they're foreign and exotic and what-have-you.
Dat headline.
It's about Ladykiller ina Bind.
Winning with my janky as fuck ramp druid vs cthun priest.
FEELS BLOODY GOOD MAN.
Noelor ?
P ok with this.
So far at least.
Diablo tavern brawl is up no pack just cardback.
MoonWolf Glenn has just accidentally reminded me the SA crew did an epilogue session for their 13th Age campaign titled 14th Age of course.
The party included both a multiclass Bard/Commander AND an Occultist.
All the dice tricks.
*and* a Terrain Druid sub healer.
Or wait no...
Pute Commander and Bard/Ranger?
In any case yes.
All the off-turn dice tricks.
MoonWolf my LRT.
Tahts dan alright.
MoonWolf also while I was at Mair's I think? I went to the effort of finding and fav'ing this.
Rank 21 tempo mage v reno lock.
Firelands pulls trogg that adds coin to your hand on opponent spell cast.
Clears board with argus PO shadowflame.
Gives me some coins.
Top deck a flamewaker when he was below 10 and had already reno'd.
The amount of experience needed to reach levels after 100 is now constant 20000 XP and will no longer reset after each promotion *.
Well thats bullshit.
Sounds like the Dev comments say it was explicitly to stop people quitting at '99 to wait for seasonals.
Great the D3 patch introduced a resolution flicker whenever I boot it which resets my taskbar icon size.
Playing support.png.
Jesus fuck my teammates are dumb.
Hey lets go charging ahead instead of you know guarding the payload.
So that a lone fucking genji can push it.
Sounds like a solid plan.
Still so apt.
Aaand here we are.
But this being modern gaming.
Its a teaser for a thing that will be announced later.
The ending movie at the end of the tristram rift is a nice touch.
Even if the loot table is kind of underwhelming =p.
So this popped on my feed.
I'm still struggling to get head round 'marowak is fire/ghost'.
Let alone the rest of the smogon fanwank argument.
Marowak-A is Fire/Ghost and pretty rad.
The detail of the smogon comments are irrelevant - the point is that luck can have huge impacts in games because there are a lot of random chance effects and crits ffs.
I mean it's not much of an article.
Lacking both news and editorial content.
But bills pay etc.
MairBear do you want to kill a diablo ? it sort of has to be a diablo.
So the whole solo achievo.
Does that mean one has to never leave the game and clear the thing?
Noelor MairBear wants to know if you want to kill a diablo.
Does it take long?
Then I shall conjure some food first.
Guess i can do the same.
!note GlennCuttlefish I-play-this-game-for-the-non-canon-insanity etc etc.
Credit where it's due the english Voice over is actually pretty neat.
Original Trainer Butts Thanks wonder trade.
GlennCuttlefish they nerfed ana on ptr.
Are you happy now ?
Oh what did they change?
Dva nerf.
'Fixed a bug preventing the Social menu from correctly displaying World of Warcraft zones that have a single quotation mark in the name' really Blizzard.
MoonWolf What you playing this season anyhow?
Monk or wizard probably.
Played cruaser last season.
Played WD before that.
I'm thinking Barb.
I just really like Str characters in that game.
Hit things with big weapons.
I had forgotten one of the sillier things from Ar Tonelico 2.
And its a game full of silly things.
That the sing the source code of the world one?
In the game there is a number 100 of magical singing girls that have gone berserk and that act like like mini bosses.
When you beat them you forcefully give them Magitech powered therapy.
In a minigame.
And then they're not trying to kill everyone anymore.
And then you can recruit them to the fanclub of one of your party members.
Which lets you EQUIP THEM.
And they'll give a character bonuses.
And you can level them up.
Fore more bonuses.
Can't equip them to magical singing girls though.
Only to frontliners.
Reyvateils have a completly different system for everything.
Like leveling up.
Normal characters level up with xp.
Reyvateils level up by taking a bath with magical crystals in it.
There is a magic crystal and bathtoy arranging minigame.
AR2 broke Minister.
I wish I had enough time to work on a game.
Anathema poe has stash tabs for sale.
Also you have a normal office hours job.
You totally have time to play a videogame.
I meant make.
>bath toy arranging minigame.
Are the rescued singers dedicated fans of one of your team or are they fickle enough to join whichever fandom you want?
GlennCuttlefish it's hard being the father of a teenaged daughter tho.
Are the rescued singers dedicated fans of one of your team or are they fickle enough to join whichever fandom you want? <- one specific person on your team.
Went to the SA Blizzard subforum.
The top three threads are all Overwatch threads with different quips about Tracer being a lesbian.
Including too late your money's gay now.
Anyway is 2.4 the current D3 patch?
Will the new season change which sets Haedrig gives out?
Noelor yes rotated around again.
Damn it I still havent beaten one of those Kill boss X cursed chests yet.
Ooh and barbs get Leapquake this season.
While Crusader gets thorns again.
There got Wirts leg and the cow pet.
Currently working on the demon portraitframe.
No idea if want to do the Butcher pet or not.
How long will that thing last anyway.
I have one monster left on level 6 and on on levl 12.
GlennCuttlefish all of january.
So while listening to music I have somehow ended up on a speaker manufacturers webpage.
You know this is out of my and everyone elses price range when you have to order the catalogue separately.
How much is the catalogue?
Probably free bu would have required registration to the site.
MairBear season has begun btw.
I'm trying to get into a game but the servers are busy.
Mines taking all day just to load.
I blame Dalaran tbh.
I love how my phone says its -12 v.
Or -13 that feels like -17.
You nordics with your weather are makin us look bad.
We do not need help making ourselves look bad.
Whelp we've reached the singularity.
I like how my Wizard is a random murdermachine. Managed to kill Belial so fast my friend just went Wait what the fuck?
Found warcraft movie dvd on sale in hmv today.
Inc the copies with hearthstone/heroes codes inside.
Mwahahaha now my tempo mage can be slightly less shit.
Woo it got warm.
Shipping intensifies.
How does overwatch keep working worse after every patch.
What kind of a fucking retarded baboon codes at blizzard.
Noelor omg primarina's Z-move.
Today xkcd is about me and MoonWolf.
Basically what i said to another channel about that comic.
What are you doing still running ts/vent when discord is a thing?
Discord is gross.
MairBear do you have time at some point to trade pkmn back and forth for evolution?
At least its not skype vOv.
Noelor probably yes.
Cooked_Auto I feel it is important to note that the Convict's hair in Gungeon is amazingly animated.
Duly noted even if I am watching that LP =P.
You watching it also is why I tagged you.
I am not sure how seriously I can take a show about chronologically challenged loli nazis no matter how seriously it tries to portray itself.
Some great expressions in this and the hype moments were rather well done. Still cant get over the premise.
Which one's this?
Urara meirochou will fill my cute girls doing things with yuri undertones slot it seems.
So far Seiren is not at all my thing.
Demi-chan wa kataritai seems like something I will enjoy. Supernatural shenanigans.
That set dungeon is actually pretty fun but fuck doing it again =V.
Omg rift level 5 and level 1 2 and 4 all had a single elite pack @_@.
Just pausing for a moment.
Looked at the conquests for this season.
Suddenly felt a desire to take a break. Strange how that happened.
Cant imagine why.
I'm doing a lunch thing myself.
Eventually we will run out of loss edits.
That's what it was?
BwaS if it makes no sense but has 4 panels.
Probably a loss edit.
BwaS coke or coke zero?
Well i can't be in this channel with BwaS anymore.
MoonWolf I have continued to be very loot-lucky this morning.
Hate all luck havers.
I really need to get one specific belt.
Can i get that belt ?
I've had good other belts.
But not that belt.
I mean I also need a belt.
But I finally got my Restraint and just now a Moritorium to put in it which is a pretty big survival boost given how my build deals with damage.
Just heal through it.
Just heal harder.
I'm either airborne.
Or taking loooads of damage.
So being able to spread that damage over the airborne period is nice.
Are you sure there is a non airborn phase.
Isn't that just running too a new pack ?
Yeah the throwing a rock to heal phase.
I don't understand the one you suggested.
Why would I get to packs via the ground?
Because its faster than jumping ?
Depends which direction I'm going because irregular screen dimensions.
But eg when I did the set dungeon running was always incorrect.
Needed to jump everywhere because that map has lots of cliffs and also can't risk too much of the ground being not-frozen.
Anyway I'm off to get some c0ke.
141132 › ~MoonWolf well i can't be in this channel with BwaS anymore - I drink both Zero and Diet v.
It keeps getting worse.
I drink neither.
I feel kind of cheated out of that potg.
Kill half their team and save my team from a dva ulti by timing my sym shield perfectly.
And genji gets it for last second ulti.
I had a wicked one the other day on oasis.
Point was in overtime ish.
I was on zarya on a respawn had ulti called out for any follow up pharah called out barrage.
Graviton'd the point for like 4 spammed right click and justice followed from the side.
So beautiful <3.
I am starting to understand how pharah is supposed to be played.
Just stay behind your team and shoot rockets at chokepoints.
Turns out new set setup much better than the old.
Plus group support bonus.
Damn find a pair of better legendary pants for my Wizard and then it turns out I dont regen health when wearing them.
Those are a little gimmicky.
GlennCuttlefish national treasure yoko taro.
Damn it got a set weapon that's still worse than what I have. that +10% damage is just insane bonus.
More devs need to take that attitude.
And the matchmaking in OW is still fucking terrible.
Second time in a row I got put in a match that has 20 seconds remaining and my team sans tanks or healers.
Yeah the one you're a backfill for was a disgruntled type trying to role-fill and getting nothing.
Great this team had a pharmercy that just duo'd in the middle of bumfuck nowhere backlines.
And not actually helping to capture the point.
GlennCuttlefish sweet sweet backfill xp though.
This hot headed pyrotechnics expert is the only one deserving of my bandaids.
And I'm a bit like you with pharah.
Give me a reinhardt shield to blast any day.
Want me stealth jetting over their backline to punt them for 6 into the drink? get out of here.
Stealth jetting has its uses if their team is not filled with snipers.
Good for healer hunting.
Assuming you can use cover of course.
If there is no cover nope not going anywhere near that place.
Noelor> GSL dates.
Playing pharah does give me newfound hatred for snipers however.
I guess I always had that hatred.
That it is.
I am starting to suspect I am invisible to healers on my team.
On 3 rounds now they would rather switch than heal me.
Eorzea is home to some of the biggest cocks in the realm.
Theyre really getting the full length- err that is to say milking t- no. They're uh. Trying hard to weave cock in whenever they can. And I'm sorry Chocobuto or Chokabuto wouold have been a much better name than Cock kabuto. Even if it's just called Tori Kabuto when it's put into your bags.
Kazakus/Reno decks lack consistency to empower two cards. End up having the perfect answers anyway.
MairBear i'd like to watch you win a match of HS.
This rift will take 2 mins more if I somehow go real slow.
MoonWolf let me know when that match ends.
Got a great save as Rein yesterday defending Anubis 2 about to hit Overtime when their team makes a final push see D.Va flying down the middle and begin charging hit her just after she activates self-destruct carry the bomb out of the temple -> we win.
I need to get a modern gpu so I can do that post-event recording stuff.
Anathema good job.
Took one for the team.
Also found out that Symmetra's company enslaved people in Lucio's country o_0.
I killed her Lucio and he goes and that's for my people back home.
Anathema you're doing a you again in mumble.
Yeah they're not good guys.
Oh must have left my desktop on.
Something must be stopping it sleeping.
Today's mission gets a little.... Buggy.... Yeaaaahhhhhhhh Jaaaaake fix your game.
I fucking love Nicola Sturgeon.
Do you seriously think there is no plan? for brexit I do.
Surely by now there is a plan.
Have you seen the UK government?
The chief negotiator resigned early citing there is no plan.
I retweeted the video if you are interested.
This one really speaks to me.
Yup done that.
!note MairBear I'm doing Battle Tree and just fought... a Golisopod with an Eject Button o.0.
So the opponent just quit the moment you hit him ?
Free win ?
MoonWolf no it just switches out.
But that's also Golisopod's ability.
So it was double able to retreat when hit.
Gotta be safe.
I love this pokémon so much.
Will probably play through Sun for a good one at some point.
Witnesses saw it pulverize a dump truck with a single punch.
I just wonder-traded my Mimikyu for a Pichu.
From I assume a 21-year-old dutch trainer.
Given their name ended -95NL.
They both look Exactly The Same.
So its a fair trade.
Well it happened that way round this time. My team was a ragtag group of useless pieces of shit and we won the enemy team with 2 healers.
Their mercy had gold kills.
Mercy does a surprising amount of damage.
Tetris is whack as expected. Not as whack as previous years since its a puzzle mode thing.
Well not really puzzle mode but you have to clear certain pieces.
Dear game devs. If your Game Over screen lasts longer than it takes to get back to it. You're an asshole.
I have found the best combo of things in D3 for my Wizard now. Whenever I use one of my RMB skills they also fire off one of my other damaging skills every second and then I have the belt ability that slashes the resource cost for my beam by 65%.
Is it Ghudda?
Oh no it isn't.
Its a quality build.
That you should play.
Very fast clear speeds.
It is just look at that attack speed!
When does the current league end?
2 months from now.
!note mairbear it's abathur free week.
Well blue hair red eyes all silent and icy... Rei is of course a Rei expy.
Which rei's the first rei?
The one they stuck in unit 00.
Wasn't there a first one that didn't make it that far and you mostly saw a second?
But the caniconical reis are first rei soul powering unit 00 second rei which we meet at the start of eva and third rei which replaced the second one after her suicide run.
Yeah that's roughly what I'd remembered.
I can't see how anyone can work there.
The whole place is a circus.
Every time something goes wrong just send in the clones.
They only cloned one horrible human alien hybrid girl.
Everyone is clone. oscar is clone. shinji is clone. rissoto is clone. jendoe is clone. ritz co is clone.
Yeah you know.
How many janitors do you think that place goes through in week.
A millenia from now some archeologist are going to unearth a legion of janitors in candlewax.
No janitors. only flush facility with LCL. all clean.
!note Noelor Ferio just negged the shit out of Fuu.
!note Noelor Also Umi is just straight up shipping her friends.
Protoss tries to pin terran flanking assault. Goes awry.
BLIZZARD! OI YOU FUCKERS!
IF I DISENGAGE 1 SEC BEFORE REACHING THE BASE OF A CLIFF THEN THAT MEANS I BREAK MOMENTUM AND TAKE 0 DMG.
Don't you fucking go and ignore it but start the cooldown as I'm staring at a corpse.
Then fling to the other side of the zone when there's another gy RIGHT FRICKING THERE.
It's finally happened.
Barrage is actually the -worst- talent at the 90 tier in Marksman.
And Sidewinders is garbage too.
What changed ?
Sidewinders Generates less focus and its competition in the talent tier do more damage now.
Barrage is only slightly behind but it is behnd.
All of barrage 's tier is viable. But Murder of Crows is single target and volley outperforms barrage provided the enemies are clumped.
Less pulling extra packs by makking barrage inferior.
If they're spread however barrage still good.
But it used to deal 100% more damage to your target and they removed that it's a blanket aoe.
Also 7.1.5 is out so rip glenn playing ever again or something.
Rip glenns playing.
So for the past few years i've been watching a very slow lp of all the xenosaga games.
And apparantly there is a FUCKING VN.
So i'm reading a VN lp now.
And now KOS-MOS is a catgirl.
Urgh literally ate 1.5 hours ago why am I hungry again.
Damn while I was trying to sleep last night / this moring I thought of a question I was gonna ask in one of the r/fitness weekly question threads but now I've completely forgotton what it could have been.
How do i stop my everything from hurting all the time?
Welp failed a 3 chest arcway run by 7 seconds. Because the boss spawned at 99% enemy forces cleared and nuked all the mobs.
So we spent 2 mins running around to find one more mob to kill.
Is that a wow thing.
That doesn't sound like a wow thing i'm familiar with.
A Legion dungeon.
The helpscreen was never useful anyway.
Nice a whole 2C.
Yeah and its snowing currently v.
I wish it would snow here.
England is shit.
Do you really want snow in a city though.
Cambridge isn't a real city.
Not a real city in a not real country. It works out v.
I looked up cambridge on wikipedia.
Turns out it has a section called Trumpington.
Located in the driest region of Britain yet people still complain about all the rain here gits.
This is one of those driest by 5% difference things isn't it.
Because it's all flat so everything floods.
MoonWolf half as much as average.
Infinite jukebox is great but 20 minutes of gangam style is quite enough.
So I got a coupon for a free tshirt from qwertee so I ordered two got sent a wrong one and they are sending the correct one for free and letting me keep the other 3 tshirts for 1 o/.
...clear the point of 2 turrets 2 trollbjorns 2 anas alone and then keep them off it until we win.
And not even a potg.
Fuck this game.
Well if that's what your concerns are this time.
Then I'm sure things are fine.
My team was 3 snipers.
A lone zarya who timed their ulti exactly when everyone was dead.
Next round playing no limits we are against a team of a reaper a widow 2 symmetras and a pharah.
And these chucklefucks in my team decide 2 roadhogs is a good idea.
I don't seem to get much out of reaper these days.
Reno paladin. well that's not one I've seen much of.
Problem with reaper is that most tanks can deal with him easily.
With a cthun buffer card in for some reason. no cthun to buff from the looks of things.
His guns just dont do enough damage to deal with tanks and everything else is a pain in the ass to hit.
Turns out a brann-cthun drop is rather good at pushing lethal ^^.
Fuck this game also.
Face hunter thinks he's amazing with misplays in placing of dire wolf alphas and raptor/crocolisk.
Why? OH YEAH DOUBLE AZURE DRAKE TURN 3.
Of course whenever it's ME trying to play my regular hunter deck they get the opposite perfect opening.
Then you get the deck mirror match where opponent finds the ramp and win condition first even with lower card draw.
How fucking convenient.
MoonWolf yeah Ferio's a shit.
That dungeon was actually cool though.
I can't believe this game is secretly... kinda good?
That seems about sufficient.
Facebook can just not remind me about those days.
MoonWolf do I keep an Ancient Leoric's Crown?
That feels useful to have around but idk.
Sure why not.
Its nto like your stash is small.
Also Kadala can sell me Mighty Belts if I click belt right?
Also Blackthorne's and Krelm's!
MoonWolf I'm still watching Tie stream Uranium to boggle at it.
Guess who showed up and said this I'm still disappointed they didn't name Klefki PoKEYmon.
How many hours of this did they record ?
Idk I think this is the 2nd session.
The stream was ages ago before SM.
What's the best thing for paragon xp? GRifts > NRifts > Bounties?
Cycle doing Rifts at the highest you can quickly kill and doing the Grifts with the keystones you earn.
Yeah NRifts are pish rn because I'm locked at T9 until I get more paragon.
Are GRifts with puggies a bad idea? and/or what's the etiquette there.
I never go greaters with pubbies so i have no clue.
Yeah Ive only done them with a friend who plays a crusader.
Neph seems fine though?
Because that's fixed level and as mentioned they're a joke with my gear.
Regulars is fine well its hit or miss if you have a party thats any good.
Wtd is the Brawling tag?
So i'm in this dramatic moment in AR2's story the world looks like its literally ending again long story and we need to sing a song that will build a new floating continent to evacuate too.
Sort of RIGHT NOW.
So what do i do i take the time to put all my magical singing girls in a bath with some magical crystals to level them up.
Nice and relaxed.
Rubber ducky some bath salts.
Since there is that champions ring you can teleport to.
Oh did that actually get into the game at some point?
It's the guy in Barbarian gear pretty much.
I was going to say BDSM gear because its pretty damn close =p.
Also beam spamming as a Wizard is surprisingly fun even if my DPS doesnt seem to be as good as my blender Monk.
Why are pubbies leaving legendaries on the ground? =/.
I'm only mad because I can't pick them up.
I imagine they're either looking for set pieces or they are just idiots. Because they are pubbies I am automatically leaning more towards the latter option.
Why are pubbies leaving legendaries on the ground? =/ <- no clue showing off ?
Wasn't it a runescape charade to scam people out of their gear?
It doesn't work in D3 anyway I would believe.
The pubbies cleared out the last floor of the rift after killing the boss.
Is that normal?
It seems weird to me but idk.
I do that occasionally.
Just chug along until I hit the end obelisk. Mostly because I'm curious what I might find for stuff as I go along.
That's also how me and my friend discovered there are 10 levels to the Cow rift yesterday =p.
Which of the ten cow levels was the secret one?
Dunno we just stumbled upon the Cow Rift earlier and got the event where you kill the cow princess.
I was half expecting a Bardiche to drop but that never happened sadly.
We were however greatly amused that even the guardian was a cow.
Ah yes now I recall where I left this episode - she was fucking the table corner.
I got my first Potion.
It grants resource a useless bonus for my current build!
Mine gives life on hit.
Which is great for my build.
Since it hits a ton.
I'd also apprecaite that one.
Oh an Ancient Wailing Host.
Time for a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth? =P.
Man killed in a crowd today as he chanted a WoW killphrase death ruled a suicide.
Look at CA's image.
So there's a new Isaac whatever out.
Here's a video of some of its bugs.
Noelor lord of the fliiiesss.
It's really weird when the normally quite professional ex-investment banker lady who sits across from starts talking about Pikachus and Charmanders because of Pokemon Go.
I mean she's quite Essex'y sometimes but that's different.
Thats... thats something.
But its bad.
People have hobbies.
Ex investment bankers can like pokemon anathema.
Lol Microsoft computer support called me just now but the line was so fucking bad I couldn't hear a thing what the person on the other side said.
Don't kinkshame MoonWolf.
I bet she likes being kinkshamed.
Is this a real comic ?
You know having superman there seems unfair.
I dunno Zsords are pretty good.
And superman could pick one up and chuck it into the sun.
Superman is awkward like that.
MoonWolf Thijs playing renolock saw a fireball carefully counts to make sure his opponent can't lethal him next turn.
Enemy plays pyroblast.
Chat explodes with new card and Pyroblast in 2017 and so on.
Did he die with healing in hand and the mana to use it?
Also was it a babbling pyroblast?
Got my essays from before Xmas back.
Anathema my tutor complimented my analysis of Scottish phonology =.
BwaS it was a hard pyroblast actually picked and he had a reno ready to go.
Mage hp? taunts up?
But empty board.
Got greedy payed for it.
Should've just taken the full heal if he was that close.
All of my opponents on the tavern brawl conveniently getting the tri-class cards.
Including kazakus which they just so happened to have uncontestable duplication available for.
And don't get me started on rogue getting coldlight shadowstep in the same hand.
Or Technical class?
New classes called Technical.
Looks like a heavy weapons oriented class.
A pure technicality.
Don't noun adjectives =\.
Technical got nouned a while ago.
When people started putting really big guns on pickups.
Why is it not Technician.
Sounds too office-y obviously.
I mean yes I don't know why they gave a guy with a flamethrower and rocket launcher that name but whatever.
Ok yeah that seems like a misfit.
Misfit tried to autocorrect to Mair there.
Misfit tried to autocorrect to Mair there <- i'll allow it.
!note Noelor i don't know if you follow the thread but if you don't enjoy this.
!note Noelor Rayearth.
Erm who's this edgelord version of ion hazzikostas I'm looking at?
Its pretty good yeah.
I can't remember when the old fivers stop being currency.
So I've taken to spending them as quickly as possible when I actually get one.
5 may apparently.
After which point the BoE will still exchange them for you.
Oh boy joined eichenwald in progress that was against 5 trollbjorns and a mccree.
Our team was no healer and our tanks were hog and winston.
Is it just me or did they change the system tray icon for b.net?
Why are all my tavern brawl opponents roping paraplegics.
How do these retrogrades get away with smorcing all the time.
Pissing me off.
MoonWolf I got my Immortal Raekor set together \o/.
I'm playing a terrible videogame.
Well I'm going to do some solo Neph Rifts to try and learn this build.
I have already concluded that charging is worse than jumping.
And gone back to Might.
I don't blame you.
I always haated that set.
Might try pure Kings if I gather enough of it.
The main difference is that leapquake has CD reduction whereas Raekor's just has... CD not triggered if you only hit one enemy.
Today in kripparian I let one of my smurf accounts slip a bit so when I laddered with it I was rank 20.
What an ass.
There proceeds 20 minutes of bashing opponent's decks assumes everyone else is a garbage player who can't build or play.
Being generally an asshole.
Oh look he sniggered at the murloc paladin running pirates and elven archer for triggering acolyte but double anyfin is still... a fin.
In todays anime our premise is Woman drunkenly stumbles upon a dragon who agrees to become her maid.
Fuck you maid dragon is great.
Been reading that for ages.
If a dragon asked me to be a maid.
I wouldn't say no.
Its ridiculous and dumb as hell but at least very self aware about it.
Noelor nono the dragon becomes the maid.
Same tho honestly.
Also they fall in love.
Also more dragons show up.
This all seems fine.
Unless this turns into some sort of Oh! My Goddess deal.
That still upsets me.
I stopped reading it a decade ago and the end still upsets me.
It gets much weirder than that.
But not more upsetting.
Not sure if its the same in manga but lost it at the first afterworks drink scene.
Well i've not watched the episode yet and its been years since i read that chapter.
So i have no clue.
Oh cool they gave tooru a nictating membrane.
In dragon form.
Someone really actually cares about animating this dumb thing.
GlennCuttlefish did you watch this OP.
Its a little lsd inspired.
Didn't really pay that much attention to it.
<- dragons are so useful.
Well that was fun.
Entire enemy team decided to try that all symmetra bullshit on us.
Guess what map has a lot of vertical space and who has been practising symmetra lately.
So you killed them.
Because all symmetras is a dumb team ?
I mean I was pharah.
Ps all sym is pretty nasty if you let them build up.
Because for reasons unknown shield gen stacks.
Why does it stack.
Its not an issue in normal play since its 1hero/team now.
But in all play it gets kinda bullshit.
Some of them got sorta salty after that.
All symmetra is a terrible team.
1 is great 2 sure bit weird.
All is just asking to get blown up.
I've won all sym many times.
Because once you get those ultis stacking it gets ridiculous.
Sure i guess.
Team full of 600+HP symmetras.
But before that you are a team of squishies.
And sure turrets are nice.
But they have explosives.
Scientists get void raided pretty darn fast.
MoonWolf ok I've now made a King of Earth set and oooh boy.
Oooh boy ?
Replace shouting with super saiyan.
How do I actually get to these bosses for the season journey?
Which ones ?
The ones I got the keys for.
I don't actually know how to summon them.
Is it cube-based?
In tristram in the north there is a house with a door you can attack off.
Go in there use one of the machines.
It'll open a red portal.
Alright now to just grind some gems.
Well this is a new one Titanforged 895 beating previous in slot by 30.
Wonder why we lost.
Oh...4 minutes on point. as tracer. Alone.
There were probably 6 reds in between you and the other 5 blues.
This manga's translation sure handles one gender-neutral character's titles differently to how the anime adaptation sub did...
Not sure if opponents were both bots or both really slow and no respect for mage secrets.
Hell turn 1 played secret keeper the hunter kept spamming secrets and buffing my minion.
And from that into the shittest Greater Rift floor for a thorns sader.
A whole bunch of grots to tar pit me from finding elites and a billion of those flame guardian mobs the ones that throw fire at you that lights the ground. Which doesn't reflect thorns and if you're held there murder through your resistances. v.
Is anyone still reading Questionable Content? I'm not the only person who thinks the current arc is awful right?
Dropped it a while ago.
Whe it was agressivly not going anywyhere.
The last few ones are especially bad.
Wonder how much more expensive Brexit has made the Nintendo Switch for me p.
Quite a bit.
What with the weak pound making imports expensive.
<- but i sort of liked the scar.
I assume the Switch wont run Wii U games.
Well it doesnt look like it has a disk drive for starters.
Damn Nintendo only has 5k employees.
I think so.
Wild ladder rank 23 load into a murloc shaman with golden basics rolling hungry crab wombo-combo.
Followed by aggro paladin rolling sword of justice into knife juggler muster for battle.
But then you have to rationalise dude you're running naxx n'zoth priest what are you complaining about.
Thats the risk you accept when you go to wild.
Blizzard sure didn't promise balance.
Lol I got SoJ. It's worse than what I already have. How disappointing.
I was mostly amused.
Especially since one of them is a yellow ring.
Sweet jesus ran into a pack with four elites D.
Friend you have not picked up what was put down.
Noelor maybe its code.
Got a new phone today.
Bought one or part of your contract ?
It allows a different wallpaper when locked so.
On contract I paid a little to bring the upgrade forward but they also lowered my sub on the new phone so it moreorless nets out.
It also prompted me to switch from feedly to inoreader following a convo had with Smurf at Mair's.
So far a positive experience in that it has a dark mode.
Still using brief the firefox plugin.
Alas that involves firefox.
Yeah my S5 does the lock/home screen wallpaper distinction.
Don't think my previous android did.
But there was a lot that went wrong with that one.
Oh that is... quite the offer from HotS.
All heroes are free this weekend.
Can't wait for the inevitable symmetra nerfs |.
Like they're coming any time soon.
Anathema right now they are too busy making d.va terrible again.
Well flipping armour/health while ignoring all the LoS bullshit that goes on with her ult.
That armor health ratio is going to kill her viability.
What kind of bullshit bizzarro weekend is this.
My team lost and people complimented my healing.
Attack the objective yes very nice winston.
Have you considered it's a 4v6.
Because you keep staggering death timers.
AND THERE'S NO FLIPPING SUPPORT?
Supports a bad class.
Just don't die.
Supports are just a cheap tactic to make bad players better.
Try being good instead.
Team gets a triple makes it a 6v3 great opp to push last few yds.
What do they do? scatter like mice cos a rip tyre started.
Which itself got a triple.
Wait they scattered and still died ?
This character is a total lesbi-anime this is a good description.
Could mean one of about 100 characters though.
In this case Athena from the Borderlands Se-Prequel.
Could be basically any cut girls doing things anime.
As featured in the Telltale one.
The punchy tank guy was called Brick right?
He just jumped into a room through the window grabbed one person then jumped out the opposite window and ran off into the forest.
Sure as long as he screamed the entire time he was on screen.
I wonder if they can unfuck the series in 3.
Tales is simultaneously the best Borderlands and the best Telltale by some accounts.
I remember the first episode being good.
Not the best borderlands mind you since it is plagued by telltale gameplay.
Brick just punched someone with a venus flytrap wrapped around his fist.
That makes your punches do extra damage against organic targets.
All this talk of punching things is making me want to play the first one again.
GlennCuttlefish btw did you hear about Finnair making international news today?
And it wasn't delayed till tomorrow? Progress!
MairBear being Finnair I'd've believed it was delayed to today.
I mean from what I've heard from friends it cant be worse than usual.
In todays episode of ridiculous nazi child witchcraft backstory.
*temporally challenged nazi child witchcraft.
This series is about some kind of loli accountant magician of futurepast not-nazis.
Great expressions in this if you can get past the premise.
Are you watching the witch academia anime i forgot the name of btw ?
...little witch academia?
Well not at the moment.
But I did check the first episode.
That lady's eyeliner is something else.
I dont think its eyelines. I think her eyebrow has gone feral.
Notzi magic ?
Nah her eyebrows are blonde.
Could be hella mascara?
Wonderful. apparently symmetra now comes with a projector for invisible walls around literally every cliff in ilios.
Nah since there is a scene where she got forcibly..make up'd? made up? Her face painted and the eyebrows are still there.
Wait am I thinking of the right word in english.
Eyelashes are the ones on your lids eyebrows are the ones on the ridge over the eyesocket.
You are right.
No was more to no I wasn't thinking of the right thing.
Kawaii is about as far from that character as it gets usually.
So far I am enjoying this show. Even if I must again state that its premise is ridiculous.
So there was a talent in monk pvp that was bugged it was sometimes coming on outside of pvp.
In 7.1.5 they fixed it...
So now it doesn't come on even in pvp.
!note ChaosSmurf.
Try practising pharah when your team is an aimbotting widow a godly soldier and a great mccree.
The moment they fucking smell your jet engine you're shot down.
I don't pharah.
At times I wonder why I have Komm süsser tod on my support playlist.
Then I look at my team.
Its full of shinji's ?
No but it makes me wish for that sweet death.
Signs pointing to me having given up on my team I hear enemy genji ult first reaction is not to run for cover but to dig out my mercy pistol.
If only that did anything to genji dashing through you and slashing once.
You still usually have a second to shoot him.
MoonWolf the tags on this.
Thats AOOO tags for you.
Ahh so far only that fic uses it.
What a shame.
That last tag.
Are there enough works to warrant a tag of its own.
On one hand seems like there should be a better tag to cover that sort of thing. On the other hand it is final fantasy fandom we are talking about here.
There are horrible horrible depths to plunge in the AOOO tag system.
Less said about the writing quality v.
Noelor get my first compass rose get 2 more right aftwards.
Could have gotten those a little more stpread out game.
That'd have been nice.
MoonWolf nah that's just how the pity timer works I reckon.
Sounds more like a taunt timer.
Those are the same thing no?
Well they shouldn't be.
I hate that the game suddenly doesnt want to check of conversations as complete for my Wizard.
It resets each time you log in no?
Well it only happens for the Wizard they stay done for the Monk. Except Tyrael.
Bwaha speed pylon right before the rift guardian which turned out to be Voracity wheeee can't catch meee.
Windows what are you doing this time.
Suddenly my sound and controller stopped working.
Except its not all sound just sound in games.
Volume mixer claims I have no audio device installed yet I am listening to music right now.
Yeah that can happen sometimes.
Lol all 3 of OW comp seasons so far my top 3 playtime have been lucio rein dva.
Bah. guess its time for the monthly reboot then.
So we'll see him in 6 hours because there's about 20 pieces of firmware updates waiting on a reboot?
Lijiang 3rd point night market at about 80% in our favour.
Reds come in lose a couple helden sterben nicht cast just as our dva and junkrat both launch ults into the choke.
The long climb out of bronze sure is fun when red comes with a gold in their three man premade.
Red team bias.
Oh fuck off now the wrong pad is assigned #1 and wont work with half the stuff.
Legendary from classic spectate pack. And it's a duplicate alexstrasza.
Which got me enough dust for a sylv so I guess it's k.
Now I am not saying guilty gear has some ridiculous character designs but.
Because of course we have to get a ninja chief of staff after the ninja president.
Oh is that how Xrd is supposed to be pronounced.
It's beautiful glenn.
Oh boy oh boy.
Solo queued into a team that was all randoms against a 4stack smurf team.
I had one of 'those' hanzos in competitive last night on gibraltar defence as mercy.
So red had the payload pushing down the underpass hanzo died somewhere.
Goes in chat where were the heals.
But then thinks he can come back with a jk after half the team called out that they were getting them.
Holy fuck what is this team doing.
Had most kills on point.
Guy drops off support to roll hanzo cos he sees a zarya and thinks team can live the weeaboo dream wombo combo.
Red team bias still.
Welp someone i know got arrested in connection with the murder of his brother o_0.
I learned yesterday that Paizo is making a sci-fi version of Pathfinder v.
And it's called like Starfinder or something.
I guess they ran out of fantasy monsters and scenarios to fill monster manuals and APs with.
Then again they did add Greys in one recent book so it was just a question of time before they decided to make their own version of Spelljammer.
Welp someone i know got arrested in connection with the murder of his brother o_0 <= welp.
+int and Witch Doctor bonuses bracers dropping when Im on my monk. This is bullshit D<.
Man the damage scaling for my wizard is just so much better than my monk which makes upgrading difficulties a slog in comparison.
Nice. lost the round with 2 of our people on point.
Some people should not be in legend rank.
The opponent guy at the start of Rage Orcs latest vid is one such person.
I assembled and basecoated 3 tanks and a dreadnought this weekend. Still have uh 4 more tanks...
I need to see if I can buy some spare turrets on the internet and some more tiny magnets.
Imperial guard ?
Well dreadnought is for 30k.
Did not realise that the two leman russ kits have differences other than the guns they come with veeeery small ones.
Also it seems the LR kits don't come with the vehicle accessories sprue so I need to get some of those so I can give things dozer blades /.
Sadly my normal bitz store is out of stock with LR turrets.
Offices are terrible too cold -> put jumper on -> too hot.
'Source satans-jizz-princess' ah tumblr.
Oh dear god what a team again.
They have a decent sniper so I tell my team to counter it.
First player switches to winston chases turrets.
Second player switches to genji does a decent job surviving less good at killing the sniper.
Third player switches to d.va AND YET THE SNIPER SOMEHOW LIVES.
This phone does not like leaving chat open it seems.
That is indeed a sidebirb.
<- there is something wrong with this loss I am just not seeing it.
Woop L45 GR done without a set \o/.
I just need to do a gr13 in 5 minutes and i'll have my tab and be done with this season.
I have a few things left but yeah that's gonna be the most 'challenging'.
I also need to not suck so i can help make that happen.
Since i currently have a whole 2! ancient items.
And neithe rof them a weapon.
Need to level up my gem of hoarding for the conquest.
My only accomplishment is that I did an L15GR in 1059. At least there is progress even if I'm stuck with non upgrade drops. >_>.
D The stuff will drop eventually!
MoonWolf does hoarder cap at 50?
Thats also when it reaches 100%.
Sweet two birds one stone.
Get the Avarice conquest and then meld it into something I guess!
Troublesome. There is one special offer at one store in finland for PS4 where you could get it for cheap if you just pick it up.
Only problem is that its on wrong side of FInland.
And the shop I occasionally buy games from apparently does not understand how this is supposed to work.
They are selling used PS 4 slims for..279 euros.
And new ones for....279 euros.
I bet they don't sell many used ones.
That would be my guess as well.
Do love HotS' way of sometimes classing MVP as being this warrior player took the highest amount of damage!
Is this some sort of Blaz Gear?
Okay that sword is ridiculous.
MoonWolf I'm finally getting round to looking at the Panic rules KS Draft.
Oh that came out.
Gnome released them Friday it took <4 hours for someone to find an infinite combo.
Anyway it's split into four PDFs Game rules Character rules Forms and skills Styles and associated archetypes.
Incidentally i put some incredibly nerdy stuff in the exalted dropbox folder today.
Actual fontfaces for high and low realm.
And a giant image with oldrealm characters.
Because oldrealm will never be a font.
Also you can't spell nishkriya naturally in oldrealm.
You have to get creative.
I forget what rules they applied to OR spelling that proceeded to not work with its presented phonemics.
...actually there's a thought.
Setting aside that it's not as good.
I wonder if you could make an OR font for Hangul.
There are six obstacles Copies Edges Fog Rubble Traps and Walls ooh new terrain.
Actually if you have the time / inclination. mumble ?
Yeah that's probs a better idea.
I'm-a brb get a drink though.
Ahh Gazlowe the Mercy of HotS.
His turrets do a surprising amount of damage!
I think zeebo has a bit of that going on as well atm.
Gaz is fairly good in the brawl enemy team kept ignoring turrets for the first half of the round and suffered. And then spent too long clearing turrets while we did the objectives.
Now actually exists online.
The monster is everywhere in the first amnesia. He's like a neckbeard following someone in the mall who talked shit about his waifu.
Anathema for the record this morning's Questionable Content 17/1 is the point at which I unsubbed because just... fuck this mess.
Thisi have to see.
I don't get it b ut okay.
Questionable Content you know that slice of life comic.
Suddenly inside a fantasy mind maze.
Oh i thought it was a weird dream.
But then no context.
That's completely canon.
But anyway enough about bad things.
I gave up on that thing a long time ago v.
I think we all have now.
I can't remember the last time there was a good joke though.
Well thats bad.
It s hould have jokes.
MoonWolf did you happen to get a spare puzzle ring lately btw you seem to have a higher droprate of them than I c.
I have two.
Are you in need of gold MairBear ?
I still follow it as I always have via 4chan threads when it gets particularly dire.
Ive given it occasional glances whenever I come across it on co but thats about it.
Man today is going to be a fun day barely any sleep and taking a nap will wreck my sleep tonight anyway.
I woke up at 530 on purpose.
I was rolling around in bed trying to sleep since about 0300.
Because my oldest half brother needed to wake up early and my half brothers both can't fucking get out of bed without someone there to make sure they actually DO.
How old are they?
Oh I worked out what's disconnecting me.
Turns out this phone's just real good at killing dormant processes to save RAM/battery.
'The final book will have a lot more info on how to do a good Debut but I've delayed this draft for a month already so that can come later.'.
Cheers Gnome =P.
Interstitial skill checks mainly determine in what order the sides place themselves on the map.
Which is cool.
Aww yiss my favorite legendary.
Also played a round with us having no tanks. so I went widow.
And we still somehow won.
I need a wikipedia stylish to block images when I go reading up on medical conditions.
Or you could just not do that as a hobby.
Anyone knoe a good lamb shank recipe?
Never even made one.
This is great.
Show up one day with an antire papercraft army.
Guess this is the new at least slightly cannon overwatch ot3 now.
No moonwolf its not even slightly canon.
Two out of three are already in a relationship.
Thats 66% canon.
In an as far as we know monogamous relationship.
Its a cute ship but lets not kid ourselves.
Fuuuuck my knee ibpuprofen doesn't even work.
Its time to amputate.
Yess bionic replacement.
I know Open Bionics was doing something with the NHS.
But only for kids.
Damn kids taking my bionics.
Here is a dumb joke you pun people will enjoy.
That is a white page for me.
So disc priest has pretty piss poor aoe healing under stress. A cooldown that removes the CD of shield to spread atonement and then we have to spam our dps thing.
That tank pulled two packs featuring giant aoe-spamming mobs the scorpions at the end of nelths and then blamed the DPS for focusing the not-aoe target when we wiped.
Sorry for not focusing the not-aoe*.
MairBear thats a shame because last expansion we have pretty good stress healing.
Couldn't sustain that very long.
But we could.
I I'm not suddenly caught out Ican prepare but I am still learning of course.
The artifact is great for a huge heal but needs some set up.
Also 2.5 sec cast with a slow-moving projectile before it actually hits.
Also remember sometimes its better to just let someone die.
Even if they are not doing it wrong.
Getting through -1 party member beats dying.
Although I can't believe that the Dominant Mind talent is not an insta-pick.
Can't comment on that.
No clue what it does.
Or the ecosystem it lives in.
Contenders Aoe knockback and slow around target. 30 sec cooldown reduction on psychic scream.
Those both don't sound that good.
Dominant Mind puts a 2 min cooldown on Mind control but you no longer lose control when casting it.
It makes it ACTUAL CC.
So you can just get an NPC to help you for a bit mid pull.
Oh it also means it can't be cast on players but when has that been relevant.
All those assholes who are playing a terrible minigame.
Known as pvp.
It's for duelling a 'friend' and jumping into ditches with.
This talent is quite obviously the worst on its row and perhaps one of the worst in game- Umm.
Okay a minute cc isn't GREAT i get that.
But you are comparing too an aoe knockback on a healer in dungeons never do that.
And a lowered cooldown on a melee range fear tha sends the mobs in all directions.
Which is arguably WORSE.
While a MC'd mob will probably break soon.
It won't hurt you at all in a dungeon.
Max 30sec duration and the danger is your group will hurp-derp away and leave it on you.
But this fellows argument is that + a max of a 17% uptime.
TIL 30 sec of 2 mins is 17%.
Well even if it is.
The other options are options a healer should never take.
Because you should imho never press those buttons in a dungeon.
Turning a useless skill into a mediocre cc is great in comparison.
Maybe i'm just bad at wow these days.
Well I did find -A- use for scream. and that was when I was in a boss arena being bitten by summoned adds.
No danger of agro and the dps were tunneled.
Plus some mobs are annoyingly immune. But if they are susceptible you get their full spellbook if they had one.
So dangerous aoe cleave mob that needs interrupting becomes amazing aoe cleave pet that trivialises the pack it was in.
More mob skill access.
Its dumb and useless but i love it anyway.
Shadow priest get a different option.
A good one ?
Rather than the knockback it takes scream away and replaces it with Mind Bomb.
Mind bomb ?
Which is a 2 sec countdown aoe stun.
I'd take THAT on a disc priest.
4 second ae stone would be sweet but it's shadow only c.
Everything is going to shit just stun the mobs while i heal the tank back up.
And that is why I love mistweaver.
Instant cast 6 sec stun so even better.
Eugh 7 min on hold with my GP for a conversation that lasted like 30 sec.
!note MairBear Tass getting rework at last.
!note MairBear Got my stash tab so basically done with this season of D3. Lemme know if you need help on anything though.
Finally witness a mythical all 10 players same hero in Heroes Brawl.
Annnnnnd it's Kerrigan S.
Zerg units for everyone!
Well half of them took maelstrom as opposed to ultralisk.
I will miss playing Dva once the nerfs hit.
Its so much fun just ruining enemy hanzos day.
RYUU GA WAGA *crickets*.
They didn't take that away though.
Just damage and survivability.
Because apparantly out of all the tanks.
D.va was somehow the one in need of a nerf.
They did fix hogs hook as well.
To be fair D.va does have too much armor.
All of the other tanks have a form of built in sustain.
Reins shield recharges roadhog has a self heal zaraya has a regen on half her hp.
D.va has... dying ?
What they should do is drop dva armor a bit decrease roadhog damage and maybe increase reaper damage.
Problem with dva is that she just cant die to reaper atm. or to anything else easily for that matter.
You're in threads and stuff.
I assume we are not talking clothes here p.
Do you know what the deal is with the lack of Chip of Ironicus?
Can't say I do tbh I haven't really seen much of a mention in the thread so I just imagine real life got inbetween.
Yeah figured that sort of thing.
Just curious if you'd heard owt more specific.
Nope I assume you're following either of them on twitter anyway.
Huh neither do in this case.
Going to guess Chip's busy with gamedev if anything.
Given History Honeys is maintaining fortnightly.
What they really should do is nerf hog damage.
Yeah the whole hit shift key hit left click - grats you've killed 90% of the hero pool from full health is pretty toxic.
And that dva thing does feel a little bit overshoot going to 400 hp 200 armour when they could maybe shuffle it to half and half first.
Healed 50% of damage taken got 2 votes.
This shit is rigged.
I'm not sure if I vote much nowadays.
Red team wins it's kinda a stomp blue team cards rarely deserve anything.
My chain on that mystery heroes Genji Tracer Hanzo Widow Sombra.
Oh but we give you DVa in overtime so we give the illusion our randomisation is fair and balance.
Hey we'll give you a comfort pick for once!
Means nothing cos the map is weighted against your team and dragonstrike now curves so you'll die anyway - gg.
I will vote on my teams cards.
As long as they are not torb hanzo widow or symmetra.
Or didnt do really really bad.
Ok that last one seriously fucked up.
Red ended up 4 widow.
Who can all conveniently dodge a blindsided arrow-straight pinball rein charge.
I am not just imagining widows in a row neatly sidestepping waves and waves of rein charges.
> load into 'balanced' map for fucking once.
> get sombrero twice and red have a 3 man premade with hitscan 0 draw time hanzo.
BALANCED AND INTERACTIVE AS FUCK.
This stupid overload gimmick daily deck is winning games.
And thats not okay.
I know right?
Just randomly got the 5 minutes rift achivement while gettind more riftstones in a public game.
Are the D.Va Ana and Roadhog changes live?
Yess more ways to be a space-nazi.
Well if they go away instead of getting purged they're still gone so thats fine by me!
Harebrained Schemes need to do a Warhammer game.
Sweet need to use this to download steven universe tonigth.
Anathema what does it spider ?
No idea but it's fast.
Next to Heroes of the Storm Valeera the ...5th assassin in a row.
Plus all 5 have been from warcraft.
MairBear well people like to do dpz.
Also another stealthie so soon after Samuro.
MairBear you think they are gonna add people from DEAD GAME starcraft!?
Sc has more characters than Raynor Kerrigan and Nova? v.
Adjudant class when.
Also Playguu the hero Defiler.
Glenn I just got assaulted by Tataru and her band of ninja tailors.
Ninja.. tailors ?
I thought she was busy being a bartender.
Well ffxiv comedic scene so for a moment they possessed super speed and strength and posing dramatically.
Are they in league with the ninja haidresser ?
But she makes new outfits in her free time remember!
...I wouldn't rule it out but I don't think I'll get more backstory on them.
!note Noelor A good edit.
No idea but it's fast <- holy shit you are not kidding.
It is stupidly fast.
Does it have the latest SU? that's all I need.
I didn't look.
I'm downloading s1 of the expanse.
Oh is game actually tonight.
Likely last session.
That checks out.
MoonWolf ok so one of the things about Speed Tokens that I had missed before looking at chargen it means certain stances can be faster or slower than others.
Because they come with speed token generation ?
So Mountain Form says After you gain Speed tokens replace half of them round up with Iron tokens.
Power Form does something very similar I'll let you go ahead and guess the difference =P.
But you are also correct ie Shadow Form says At the start and end of your turn you gain 2 Speed tokens. You do not discard Speed tokens at the end of a turn.
Holy shit shadow can bank.
And generates 4 for free.
Shadow is going to be a speed racer.
It will remain Tracer's core Form.
Every time she uses offturn movement she makes blink noises.
If she uses three at once she goes wheee.
Or - yes that.
Unless its christmas then she goes hohoho.
Also song lyrics.
Carolling is an Important Tradition.
Especially mid superpower fight over a control point.
Next campaigh we're playing overwatch with panic ?
I mean maybe?
I wanna run Panic for defs.
Huh Fused Heroes no longer get an extra stance.
Wait what ?
I only get 3 ?
I guess the everyone gets archetype powers served better for balancing the three types?
But slightly more flexibility and options was the whole point.
Don't take my extra stance away.
Don't yell at me yell at gnome!
I will later.
That reminds me.
Is #badwrongfun still a thing?
Have not seen gnome there in ages though.
What server's it on?
A wild noelor appears.
Going to remain on lurkmode.
MoonWolf I joined this channel today and they're already discussing Exalted =V.
You jinxed it.
Best of all Starfinder is designed to inegrate easily with the Pathfinder roleplaying game How to make a giant fucking bloated mess.
Oh look. it's another toxic as fuck brawl where all the decks are literally ladder. . .
BwaS `hardly i played a just jade bits of jade druid.
You forget I ladder where all the netdeckers on autopilot are too cheapskate for patches.
MoonWolf Shadow Form can spend 3 speed tokens to create a trap!
How fucking convenient for this cunt of a mage that his mirror entity went off BEFORE their polymorph secret.
Fun and interactive!
This is not efficient trap creation o.
BwaS goes by play order.
But the actual thing you asked is in Wild Form.
2 Basic Tokens Fury - Deal 1 damage to an enemy within range. At the end of this turn push them 1 space.
Basic Tokens being Iron Power and yes Speed.
Two fucking games in a row.
Fuck mana wyrm.
Snowballing piece of shit.
Oh look I'm at half health turn 2.
How fucking convenient it's the mage with the coin!
And now because the matchmaking in this is overwatch-tier I now get to murder a basic deck priest.
Nope maybe not.
Turns out priest still wins fucking everything.
Get your own damn cards.
Oh hey a renolock.
Because kazakus is a casual's card. clearly.
Fuck this roping bullshit I have better use of my time.
MairBear i have literally never seen that card played.
Friend talking about it in his brawl deck.
A buff spam goons deck.
Does it work ?
Apparently it's fun and has won a couple.
My jade deck is fun too and comes with a side bonus of ridiculous self powered miracle.
Seriously innervate + aucioneer is just dumb in this.
Secret hunter was pretty fun.
'sleep with the fishes' was another one that I had literally never seen until I had it in warrior deck from the last brawl.
Zombie chow Rivendare Auchenai Shadow Word Horror.
Err excavated evil*.
What good is it me practising tracer if my teams can never capitalize 2 of the dumbasses chasing me halfway around the map.
5v4 not that much of a capitalising.
One of them being a healer?
Their only healer I might add.
Another Power Rangers 2017 trailer.
The only thing I can get behind is Zordon.
Logan and Laura's adventure road trip.
BwaS its still bad!
Logan looks great.
Its already out.
No Limits. Red Team 6 Dva's. Blue Team egh whatever the hell we want what could go wrong?
Love people who can't adjust to the meta.
Tip don't play no limits then p.
6v6 mystery hero is the only way to arcade.
Aka chain from widow into sombra into hanzo into winston.
Yeah fuck that.
How do you counter 6 dvas.
Lots of soldiers and reapers ?
Obvs 6 winstons.
5 pharahs and a mercy maybe.
Unless they are properly organized with shield rotations.
They always are.
It's red team.
Dunno I've seen some pretty bad red teams in my time.
Spotted on Stack Overflow while looking up something for excel 'My players went from 100% murderous cretins to 100% nonviolent diplomats how can I achieve a middle ground?'.
Oh. Long War for XCOM2 is already out. Faster than I expected.
 Spotted on Stack Overflow while looking up something for excel 'My players went from 100% murderous cretins to 100% nonviolent diplomats how can I achieve a middle ground?' <- there is no middleground.
Have your players command armies?
Every time I almost stop being upset over mass effect 3.
Somebody randomly posts kai leng in my life.
Remember when people thought bioware had good writing?
They did? v.
Anathema yeah it was you when you were hyping Dragon Age.
First dragon age was still decent even if full of cliches.
Lol. they're gonna be screening SAO Ordinal Scale flick in UK cinemas.
Well that'll be a weeb-fest.
I can see the black spraypainted cricket bats already.
BwaS are we going to see Power Rangers do you think?
To revel in its garbagity.
I'm I'm torn.
The ... five? six? year old that went to the first movie for his birthday says I should.
!note MairBear.
BwaS i guess 6 year old you wasn't very critical of movies yet.
MoonWolf Long War?
I hope Long War.
Long War 2!
Nothing worse than a team that fucking over-switches.
Yeah we started triple support doesn't mean you should all hop off to dps on your first wipe -_-.
Gotta love reins getting commended for dmg blocked.
They did their job.
Thats what you want them to do ?
They just stand facing red bastion.
Get chewed uo nothing behind them happens.
So here I am watching a badly animated semi 3d anime about talking animalgirls.
I feel like that crying otter eating a watermelon.
Have you considered not watching that.
And instaed watching more anime about a dragon who is also a maid.
I did. and then I couldn't.
Well I figured I was an episode and half in already.
Might as well finish watching this episode.
Is that a swimsuit with a skirt what ?
Well it is an otter.
I am not going to lie I am kind of interested in the premise of this silly show.
Kid wakes up in a park with amnesia animals have become animalgirls architecture is broken down.
Oh and theres weird crystal aliens randomly hanging around.
Kemono friends is it?
You furry =P.
Does that look like the face of a furry to you.
Thats just perfectly ordinary and acceptable monstergirl territory.
Its not furry if its monstergirls.
MoonWolf> is that a swimsuit with a skirt what ? <- this is a thing.
Has been for a while.
Its a bit silly though.
Don't think you really see them on adults that often.
I'm going to catch this guy.
And it's going to be Sassy.
Gungeon is the most realistic depiction of firearms in video games.
Second episode and this series is already in full lewd mode.
This is a seriously indecent season.
How lewd are we talking here ?
Full on frontal holding hands.
In public no less.
....2 seconds after I said that.
This is ironic considering what happens later in the manga.
Well is implied happens.
It probably won't happen in the anime.
...There better not be anyone with 4 arms.
That would be too much.
That is far too many hands to hold.
Hindu gods are the lewdest.
Asura's Wrath was constantly walking on a razor's edge of lewdity.
I lost my shit @ the 3rd post tbh.
God that thread is dumb.
That forum is pretty dumb too but whatever.
Nonetheless I laughed very hard at that post.
I am working on a Power Rangers 2017 5x5 bingo chart based on references to original series.
This loli reminds me of renge from non non biyori.
Must be the voice and violet hair.
9 slots remain if anyone has any they can think of p.
And strange mannerisms.
Bulk and skull ?
GlennCuttlefish she mostly exists to be the surrogate adopted daughter figure.
Got both of those =P.
Of course.
BwaS Jason David Frank showing up in a tenuous cameo.
Diagetic use of the theme tune.
At least one of them professing to be a Real Martial Artist.
Fights in a generic grey quarry.
Explosions for literally no identifiable reason especially while posing dramatically.
Make my monster grow.
I believe you mean grooooooowwww.
Also this outfit.
Looks pretty sensible right?
Yeah on the whole.
He legs are sticks though.
Rita btw has great aim.
Considering she chucks that thing from space.
This is that outfit seen from behind.
It has the barest minimum of both side and back to it.
Damnit lightning returns.
This otoh is a good message to see in any FFXIII.
Now don't let her leave your party lightning.
The LP's into the end game or Final Day.
So that might be possible.
Though also Odin the Chocobo might also show up to replace her somehow.
Odin the chocobo.
You know this guy from XIII?
He's back in LR but is a chocobo.
Thats even worse than chocobocolina.
I appreciate that that's how you remember her name =P.
Related to her in fact.
Noelor lightning is really not into this.
Interestingly the sync is actually better for it in English imo.
Crazy chocobo is still unironically the best chocobo theme.
But not for the reasons the thought it would be a good chocobo theme.
GlennCuttlefish is 100% correct.
Goddamnit I want to practise tracer and I get anubis all day.
Great. 2x 2stack 2 solo queues vs 6stack.
That gets my 'report all 6 for mmr sabotage' protocol right there.
6 randos vs 4stack.
Damn some guys played a 54k point game.
MoonWolf what happened to you yelling at gnome btw.
I was distracted.
Ok so in Panic 'A battle arena is a pre-made fighting zone with special rules'.
Its a boss zone.
Consider this after creating every Overwatch as a Panic creating a battle arena with Payload rules.
Well this is certainly a Twitter.
...thanks for the formatting there plume.
Today I am learning that GRR Martin is an even groggier nerd than I had previously realised.
Turns out he is a big fan of the New York Giants.
This makes him groggier ?
And .'. the named giant in the latest season is named after the jersey number of his favorite NYG quarterback.
And a character who only shows up to be eaten by a giant is named after the head coach of the last team the NYG beat in the Superb owl or something to that effect.
I would argue that this makes him less of a nerd.
For there is nothing less nerdier than sports.
So being a sports nerd paradoxically makes you less of a nerd.
That is incorrect friend.
Sports and the liking of them is incredibly nerdy.
But in any case I only said it made him groggier.
How is it nerdy.
And that level of reference is certainly groggy.
What kind of fucked up bizzarro world did I wake up in.
This is the alternate timeline where trump became president.
Oh fuck not one of those.
Something something darkest timeline?
Ugh this project has all its variables declared as publics but only has one function ~_~.
Oh They're going to make a Good Omens mini-series.
Yeeesss gooood.
There is no way they wouldn't add the Horatio back.
What's a Horatio?
Other than how many employees a pimp has.
I wouldn't call this the worst line.
Well neither did they.
Other than how many employees a pimp has <- in the grim dark future of endless space there was a really wealthy insane guy who looked a bit weird.
And decided that really the whole galaxy should be filled with perfect people.
Also known as him.
So he cloned himself A LOT.
Now he's a race.
MoonWolf oh so it's Anaander Mianaai?
Yeah but less ai and collective consciousness.
And more just literally millions of clones of one guy.
All being the perfect race together.
Are Endlesses Space and Legend fundamentally the same game mechanically m.
Planet horatio a world filled with tranquility and funky architecture. Also people with huge heads. Here calm and peace prevail in silent nobility...Except in the head polishing district where the squeaking is enough to drive a man insane.
Noelor nope different games shared lore.
Even CAPTCHA agrees I should download this rom it was real hoopy frood.
A well fired up sauna.
This is fine.
Nothing to worry about.
I suspect I am doing this series wrong.
What series ?
At this rate my order will be 3-4-5--1-2-0-6.
Yeah thats no kind of order.
That sounds like one of the orders a Haruhi series is recommended in.
Fuck those people.
Watch it in release order.
<- first one against the wall when the revolution comes.
There are things you can debate in music but only one true and holy fact Kazoo is terrible.
Struggling to think where in the Mists OST were the kazoos.
MoonWolf Unlimited Mike Works.
But what does it DO ?
This seems overpowered.
Well I mean.
Sing ? dance as a hologram ?
Light novel titles have GONE TOO FAR.
What does Nuiage! Nugashite? Kise kaeru! ! Kanojo ga kōkō debut ni shippai shite hikikomori to kashita no de ore ga seishun fashion o coordinate suru koto ni. even *mean* though?
Sew it up! Take it off? Change your clothes!! Because my girlfriend failed at her high school debut and became a shut-in I decided to become a youth-fashion coordinator. according to CR.
Speaking of CR they've apparently sacked most of their staff this week.
Havent really heard more than that tbh not really looked it up.
HotS' Latest brawl periodically gives heroes bloodlust.
So Red team always gets illidan butcher anything that having additional attack speed breaks.
Not very fun at all.
And blue team go hey I'm really good with jaina I'll pick her!
Plus I was forced to specialist 2 times out of 3.
Bloodlust hammer could be volatile.
This is adorable.
Get down mr president.
Noelor Sorry! I've been holding up the final stretch and I take full responsibility for this break. Everything but the final video has commentary recorded though and is just waiting for that audio to be edited. Speaking of Chip's told me that the last 4 Chipod Ironicasts will be coming soon posted back-to-back. Ironicus just posted in the U4 thread.
Noo too many skins I want.
Ok priority d.va > winston=hog=zen>mei>rein.
Actually since I have a decent hog skin might as well drop it a tier or two lower.
I got a tonne from the winter event and several other legendaries.
Finding ones to chase after may be tough.
I think I got most of what I wanted from christmas event.
Even so d.va is a must.
MoonWolf Fantasy panels Allowing the characters to keep their moral compass while letting Dan Shive draw whatever since 2002.
Honestly this whole mall catgirls thing is getting pretty old and stale.
Yeah I think he got a bit stuck in it.
I'm watching the T40s' LP of FFXV.
And there's finally a cutscene of the evil emperor talking to his cronies about their evil plot to get the rings or whatever.
So I'm trying to guess which of the cronies is the true villain it inevitably not being the emperor.
My best guess is this Sephiroth-looking fucker.
2nd place to the constantly-smirking schemey dude.
Sounds about right.
Are rift difficulties supposed to be somewhat exponential?
Ok that makes senes.
They are a 20% increase of hp over the previous every rift.
Every 5 is double the damage needed to clear it.
I got my face kicked in by 65 and 64 I was 5s over after having to leave halfway through to repair.
I don't know what the damage done scaling is lower because thats hwo arpgs work.
There is also a less obvious factor which is sustainability thresholds.
Where a few percents can be enough to turn an encounter from i can do this mostly by standing there into i need to kite.
Huh Mage and Wraith games.
Well thats not going to be close to the flexibility actual mage give syou.
Probably not but who knows right now.
Pokémon uranium has a gym leader who is a male dancer wearing a skirt who uses fire types.
Does he make gay fire puns too ?
This would be kinda cool if they didn't have literally every NPC in the town comment on Hey isn't it weird that our male gym leader dance in a skirt?
MoonWolf nah just regular fire puns.
I applaud the developers restraint there.
Do romhackers not know kilts are a thing?
Its a rpgmaker game.
And uhm. that probably wans't the idea.
The idea was is oh no its a gay man with a skirt its funny because he's flaming.
Some obscure post on my fb feed didn't recognise the page that I'd supposedly liked.
Oh it's flipping Hummingbird I used for anime list tracking. They just rebranded. Without telling anyone.
But supposedly they've spiked because of drama going down at their competitor.
Fucking trumps america is here people.
I should feel bad for using Archon mode to easily kill treasure goblins since I start with 47 stacks of it. Yet I dont.
There just comes a point where they're stress relief pinatas instead of frustrating runners.
BwaS well you don't die when it runs out so i can't be that overwhelming.
There’s a nasty stereotype that anime fans and Nazis are closely related as indicated by the number of virulent alt-right trolls with anime avatars you’ll find in any Twitter cesspool. <- and just like that with the first sentence I can ignore that article.
I mean an Archon is 1 hp behind 400 shield at some point it gets overwhelmed.
...oh Uranium also added an evolution for Corsola.
Into what ?
Not a fan.
Ah the magne- approach to evolution for a mob that already was flipping coral reef.
MoonWolf there is a series of new water-types based on ninja weapons.
There's Frynai a small-fry with a kunai tail.
Thats about the regular level of pokemon though.
Saidine a sardine with a sai tail.
And this is DAIKATUNA.
Why is it just trapped to its face though.
Omg this thing's pokédex entry.
It often wields Frynai or Saidine as weapons. The sword on its head is made from steel folded 10000 times.
MoonWolf because they wanted to also get a swordfish reference in there.
Finally ground the gems for Champion \o/.
MoonWolf are Conquests actually reasonably doable?
Or just bs?
Mots of the are reasonable the t13 rift in 5 minutes needs a good group with enough dps so you may need to fish for that.
That is uh not a one.
There's T10 in 2.
Oh wait you meant Destroyer.
Avarice is trivial.
Gold is ez and basically free t10 in 2 requires a group and fishing a good rift 45 without a set is doable but requires knowing what you are aiming for and getting those items.
Yeah I actually got the rift one for Destroyer.
All I have left is levelling gems even more a couple bosses and a Conquest.
350 kills in one chest once againt requires a group and fishing for it.
Sprinter seems fine?
Also probably needs a group though.
Sprinter needs a group that knows what its doing.
Mairbear tried to get the other variation of that conquest doing all the bosses in a timelimit a few times and yeah.
Its not fun if you repeatedly fail it just by a minute.
Anyway if you just want one conquest go levle your gem of avarice.
Get it to 50 then go to ruins of corvus at T10 or thereabouts run through the whole place not killing anything and make sure to hug all the walls to generate all the groups of tiny enemies.
Boon of the Hoarder?
Then murder your way through the whole place in a good pace making usre not to drop your gold counter.
Was confusing it with avarice band.
Anyway that'll be later.
Which indicentally cna be helpful for that conquest but its not needed at all.
Peopel also get that conquest by using the cow level.
Or the ultimate scrub method.
I do have a couple of bardiches.
Getting about two tab pages full of bounty caches.
You still need the gem for the cow level aproach i think.
A website alright.
I give todays political content in imgur one thing. Makes it easy to escape the time trap and close it.
My twitter has also been nothing but american politics.
I've not read it much.
Fat seal? just chillin'.
My main feed has been mixed. My other one is a lot better.
Man the dubbing in this is something.
Every street is full of japanese american urban youths.
Which dub ?
In a vs ai game of hots with my not ideal at games father so it's on noobie adept difficulty. our varian gets mad at him not being top tier skills...
So when are t hey adding some.. non warcraft heroes.
Like maybe some more diablo stuff ?
Next boss will be Kel'thuzad.
A ranged warcraft assassin.
You could add Leah.
Making the hots community both mad and also overjoyed.
Or a loot goblin.
Where's baal mephisto pretty much any other boss.
Your passive is that you cannot be stunned or slowed and have ridiculous movespeed.
But you also drop little bits of exp when you get smacked.
Think of the skin opportunities.
They already have like 7 of the things.
Normal rainbow blood gold green blue slime white darker normal pet goblin.
Your ultimate is summoning Greed.
In all her glory.
Your second ultimate is opening a portal back to your base.
Assassins Creed if anyone's wondering rather passable.
I didn't dislike it as much as bits of Passengers.
Aimless and meandering a bit I found action wasn't always coherent but it was good enough for my tastes.
Uranium has a new evolution for Eevee.
Nucleon of course.
No that would be actually clever.
Just Nucleon.
I sort of like it ?
Should we feel bad about that ?
A fakemon to surpass metal gear?
MoonWolf only a little.
Lolinazi anime is getting even better. She just doesn't learn.
Or well I guess she must at some point but for now I am enjoying this ride.
Now I am not saying that this town is full of assholes but.
Great finally found the old sensei.
Time to get my ass handed to me again.
This is what senseis are for yes.
This game has the second most ruthless sensei I have seen in a video game.
Well thats just ridiculous ragna.
Get down from there.
GlennCuttlefish also this with the tag Stop hitting yourself Carl. Stop hitting yourself Carl. Stop hitting yourself Carl.
Oh ragna and your counter bullshit.
Apparently that counter is slower to activate now so that is sadly un-achievable now.
MairBear> did the bloodlust got Valla. Fucking wrecked everyone's shit.
Great now the sensei almost murdered me by throwing baseballs.
Other than that its been easy so far.
MairBear> okay now we have it with triple butcher.
I never play this hero and it's fun as fuck again.
's p good.
!note mairbear the last round gave us vikings against more hammers than we had. they cheesed with orbital bfg but we got their core to 10%.
Man this is what you get for promising anything. now I have to live with anxiety and deadlines on top of being out of smokes.
What have you now done?
Just promised a character portrait for a videogame stream. its halfway done and all just need to ink in the lines and colour but havent been able to do it for the last couple of days.
To be fair one of those my hand was killing me and the other day I was just enjoying a hangover.
Gonna be one of those rounds.
A good offense doesn't neeeed a defense gle.
GlennCuttlefish obviously the correct support for that team is symm.
Oh it got better the dumbasses started shit talking my healing when they kept running behind corners and dying to hog hooks.
So I just went genji.
Boy sure wish I could get that first win of the day again.
What is win?
Apparently its that thing you get when you finally give up and just go useless piece of shit worst widow ever.
Disco king.
MoonWolf you still on W10?
That force close command is a bit too easy to accidentally.
Anyway my dad's W10 machine is apparently refusing to actually shut down when asked to do so.
And I have little more to offer him than 'what the hell'.
Mine does that just fine.
You have entered the Docecamension.
Oh yakuza are we sure its a typo.
...how did that yakuza part even end there.
...oh i had forgotten to press enter a hour ago thats how.
Those are some p good stacks.
Man these brawls that land as a mirror with both players going infinite with a gadgetzan sure are fun.
Never go full gadgetzan?
Was just on the 50 druid class cards q.
Got to 40 from just the first pass.
Well then.
I watched the Stevenbomb that's due for official broadcast the first week I'm in Japan.
I... do not recommend watching it a day at a time.
Tumblr taking down all nsfw content umm?
Not like the whole nintendo thing hasn't made people tired of the place already.
Which nintendo thing was this?
Some external third party kept filing complaints to remove nws art from peoples tumblrs.
<- now if they onkly you know.
Added something besides isolution.
That'd b e nice.
This post applies to the PC version. No discussion has yet taken place regarding whether this system is being brought to the Xbox One version. wait what xbox one PoE? o_0.
I think Ive heard about that before.
Recently announced actually.
The community is... divided.
There is not a single thing the PoE community is /not/ divided on.
No i'm pretty sure they are united in a mindless dislike of D3 for being... D3.
Ok true D3 is really boring.
Glad they can all agree on something.
Even D3 fans agree with that p.
Its not boring the moment to moment gameplay is fine.
Its just lacks STUFF.
Lacks new items new builds bosses goals.
Its just grind rifts to grind greater rifts to get higher on a leaderboard.
Do bounties to get crafting materials.
There is no meaningfull final boss or map.
There is no this is my final goal.
I find the gameplay boring too can't pinpoint why though.
Unless you want to count the season journey which is just grind to arbitrary level receive no feeling of satisfaction.
Teaching mythic+ tanks to respect the game again.
Full 880+ tank with legends pulled 3 packs got murdered because of that ilevel shrinkage.
TIL nextflix stars = how much netflix thinks *you* will like a show not the overall rating.
I love how this series escalates gradually. In the first one you beat mere gangs at a time.
Well so far.
British Virgin Islands have twice as much netflix content as the UK expressed as a % of available Netflix US content.
Why does that matter?
Its going to be one of those weeks is it internet?
Kirisu just amusing. The real problem is US netflix having 3x the content fot he same price including stuff I'd like to watch.
This is the first week of trumps america.
Its going to be a very one of those weeks.
What no I am not even talking about any shit like that.
I am talking my connection dropping every 5 minutes.
Well i blame Trump for that too ?
Just doesn't have the same ring to it though.
Just doesn't have the ring to it.
Probably because he'd take it sincerely.
Both in that he'd take credit and claim it was a good thing that he'd somehow made Finnish internet worse.
Thanks TheDonald? keeps the number of syllables?
He'd probably also ad lib something about finland's border with russia.
Oh yeah if he actually were responsible it would definitely be because Putin asked him to.
But he'd blame the internet pirates uploading illegal movie torrents from up there.
Damn finnish pirates.
Raiders of the baltic seaboard.
To be clear I am suggesting that trump doesn't know the difference between Sweden and Finland.
Jefffromtheoverwatchteam doesn't either.
>Americans understanding geography.
Well there was that incident with trident at the weekend.
Is this a poll?
I cannot find a way to make those show up on my phone.
It is yes.
Plume defs still ignores them but so does Twitter.com.
Oh cool this keyboard has a hold menu on its ' key for doing ‘ or ´.
MoonWolf a friend has being playing D3 on PS 4 and posted a screenshot of finally getting to the cow level.
For a while the only comment on that post was me saying moo.
Now there is a second another of her friend's saying what?
You need more friends that are friend with this person to say moo.
I am v tempted to also respond to what? with moo.
But they aren't a mutual.
N. Unless the 'host' also goes moo.
Might make it the backup.
BwaS nah as a nickname mobile noelor.
Unrelated to the moo issue.
BwaS not the question but that is a good position.
They're putting a TB voice pack in SC2. Oh dear oh dear.
MoonWolf> the twin emperors entry speech on hearthstone is swapped in order and who says what from the meeting in AQ49.
N'zoth and yog-saron also have swapped voice acting.
Odd. my IRC seems stable everything else seems to be dropping every now and then.
The Force Checks Its Alarm Clock Sees It's Only 515AM And Goes Back To Sleep.
Followed by The force is seriously late?
Followed by the force better get its shit together or its fired.
The Force visits the Job Centre.
The Force is a loose canon.
GlennCuttlefish top comment.
But why ?
Because drowning/suffering hypothermia in a frozen lake is fun.
The f is Pooch?
Ironicus assistant commentator for the long ass final Uncharted 4 update.
Oh and then.
The 50CBotS line.
Yes someone made the joke in thread.
I wonder when they got a pup.
What the even remotest fuck.
B ut its funny!
Had to rewatch just for the initial shock face.
Ironman + bugs always great.
As a friend on Skype said LW is fucked up.
I should watch this movie again.
MoonWolf reminder that you can archive entire games in Roll20.
Good to know.
But that won't solve my 86MB / 100MB problem.
0MB / 100MB <- rip game.
If i ever start again i'll have to upload tons of maps again.
You did id twitter person.
...is not buying ikea furniture a part of growing up now?
When did this happen.
I don't know.
Ask this twitter person.
And ruin my beautiful already ruined twitter post count? no thanks.
I am still confused as to what happened to 2 of my tweets.
Lost in the great tweet wars.
Trump didn't like them.
So apparently it's now possible to embed a Twitch stream as an ad?
Anyway I'm on bulbapedia and such a stream is on the page I'm looking at.
It has <4k viewers and the title is Type Null double shiny hunt!
Type Null is a gift pokémon.
You can only get a shiny one by repeatedly resetting your 3DS.
Yep seen some ppl like that.
I mean the xGDQ folk whenever they run pkmn try for a frame perfect max IV on their starter.
And if they fail they go back to beginning.
Noelor double shiny ?
What is a double shiny ?
Literally no clue.
Argh what's the Solar Hero throw charm called.
The answer was Heaven Thunder Hammer.
Also crashing wave throw.
People in the Metroid Prime thread discussing whether or not up is real presumably because Fae is commentating a game based in space.
Fedule pops by Okay so the first thing you need to know about string theory is th--no no no nope nope nooooope.
NOTHING IS REAL.
Y u do dis.
Anyway HTH is probably higher on my purchase priority list because I remembered I can use it to just punch guys into other guys.
Also Janos worked out how deal with my use of Hammer on Iron Technique.
Why stop there.
Punch guys into alternate realms.
Counterattacks with weapons that drain willpower on hit.
MoonWolf because I'm an alchemical.
So I don't get expansion charms.
Don't do t hat.
Being an alchemical does mean I get Piston-Drive Megaton Hammer though.
Which stacks with Solar Hero Form's bonus to multiply threshold hit suxx by a total of 4x.
If I got the invisibility charm I could ratchet that up to 6x on an ambush.
...omg that's an Appearance charm not Dex.
And the submodule's E4.
I could totally just take it.
It has no prereqs or anything.
Not actually worth it because I don't tend to actually have fantastically high hit thresholds on account of being a Str/Sta build.
That said I got stopped 3 attacks and 2 hits into my 5-hit flurry of punches tonight by my target's death.
Was it meant to be a boss and was it full hp before hand.
I dunno if boss exactly but she was an apostate alchemical so... not supposed to die in one flurry probably no.
Yes full health.
Also I just realised I had remembered the Piston-Driven effect wrong and should have done even more damage.
Yeah well 2e doens't really lend itself to the large single boss mechanic of fights.
Because uhm yeah.
You can just wreck them with a big enough combo.
Here are some things about DV in Exalted 2nd Edition.
- The acronym is not spelled out until its second appearance.
- At no point is it directly explained what it does.
It is *implied* to be a penalty in the attack write-up.
But only in the step of the attack process called Subtract External Penalties/Apply Special Defenses.
However other writing within the edition notably in errata assumes that DV is not a penalty but a target.
Because eg it explicitly states that the charm Serpentine Evasion applies an attack penalty instead of a DV bonus.
This fucking game.
So glad I stay away from blackpool.
You're lucky I haven't gone to bed quite yet.
Or literally 0 people here would understand that =P.
It is a description of a popular puppet show performed on English beach piers.
I don't want people thinking England is even worse than it is.
Goddamnti I thought I was almost done with this lets play.
But then I realized that youtube is in fact lying to me and there is still another 6 hours to go.
Which is oddly fitting for omikron.
Time for someone to write their 2 million word overwatch evangellion crossover.
Probably already done.
!note Noelor yeah DV is basically an external penalty but not affected by things which affect external penalties. There used to be lots of arguments on the forums about it.
Anathema because its dumb.
Thats why there used to be a lot of arguments about it.
It was unclear.
People just wanted ignore external penalty on your attack charms to be deadly.
So some combination of extended time without use + cold weather has made a lot of my metallic paints a bit odd.
Emily is reading a paper about weather monitoring and one of the problems reported in the paper is that someone tied their yak up to the weather monitor and the yak knocked it over.
There was also one where they paid some guy to wipe snow off of solar panels but to make his work easier why should I keep wiping snow off these things? the guy covered them or moved them under some cover.
Oh shit overwatch capture the flag.
I need that D.Va skin.
Yeah its the one I will spend 3k on if it doesn't drop during the event.
Would really like the zen and hog skins too.
Anathema I mean my actual query was over how Solar Hero Form's effect is supposed to work.
I.e. is it the same as Stone Fire Strike in which case its way overpriced or is it in fact supposed to multiply pre-DV successes which conversely seems way too powerful.
...I might mean Hungry Tiger but w/e.
They use different phrasing and the Alchemical charms both copy the form's word-for-word.
Anyway I'm going to go look at a better game for 10min and remake Tracer at the Dojo.
Going from memory Solar Hero Form lets you spend a mote to double your post-defence successes for the purpose of calculating additional damage.
I need those tracer and mercy skins too.
Mercy skin looked like a epic skin so I think I'll stick with my witch for mercy.
Somewhat disappointed in the Mecy one. Wanted something like Lunar Jaina.
I think its quite nice.
Its good texture work and it works with her design.
Its nto like a great new legendary skin.
But its good.
MoonWolf dyr I mentioned my password is round to the depressing will never hold anything?
A while a go.
A couple times this week I've typed will never hold hands by mistake.
Which is even sadder =<.
I'm sure there is someone out there who wants to hold hands with you.
D.va either that is not going to work or you really REALLY need to lay off the doritoes for a while.
You just need to fall from far enough.
No I dont think thats how it works.
Simpe geo.. phsysics.
Sure but somehow it just doesnt feel like it would add up.
Mercy looking v elegant.
Noelor omg po town.
Po town ?
It's where Team Skull live.
Cooked_Auto SABER GUNDAM.
Make it cannon.
I still keep forgetting the second part came out at some point.
Whelp /r/anime is predictably losing its shit tonight over kimi no na wa's oscar snub.
Don't go there its a terrible place.
Its about as bad as /a/ only they think they're better.
>appreciating animation that is not disney.
I NEED THIS.
Whelp time to grind gold for the hanbok dva.
Rein's event voice line are you chicken. I like.
GlennCuttlefish well you know how nerds is.
Second lootbox white mei skin.
That is not the right screen you screenshotted sharex.
I think i'll wait for tomorrow to get more stuff.
Because the servers are dying.
And blue team on the brawl has literally never played a ctf map before.
Yeah turtle with bastion solo support lucio on the flag that'll work.
Lucio is for the attack.
Not the defense.
Speedboost that flag away.
The boop anyone who tries to get to your carrier.
Off of bridges.
Also just y'know roadhook bullshit from red team or the genji that gets reflect headshots when I'm aiming 10 miles above his fucking dented xbox for a skull.
Wait the event is active now?
But matchmaking isn't great at least when i was playing.
Took forever to find a game errored out a lot.
Oh yeah I should probably patch this thing.
> matchmaking isn't great so no change then.
Ok you know what the biggest gamechanger this patch is?
Lucio can now wallride backwards.
Too bad the mechanic remains imperceptible as fuck leaves you spamming space bar and falling off at the slightest bump.
Which is every 2 yds.
CTF team went full camper with hanzo torb and symm.
Of course the red team was the one whose soundwaves conveniently get the distance to send you off.
Oh yeah and the red symm who despite getting spotted busy dropping teleporter still has the dps to just shred anyway.
Its pretty clear where you can ride usually there are some spots on ilios and dorado that are a bit strange.
This team's solution to going a goal down in CTF - switch to extra defence heroes.
Hah even with the new hook mechanics.
Pulled a raging winston down with me.
Is hook 2.0 in?
Last minute of route 66 attack. drop self destruct on the end zone. get a quad kill.
Helden sterben nicht.
I think it was supposed to be but I am not so sure after a couple of hookings.
Making me play it instead of doing my Mythic+ before reset.
Sigh r20 is crapping out again /.
GlennCuttlefish> well the dva hp/armour adjusts are in so maybe the roadhook stuff came with it.
Well done red team.
You fucked with matchmaking bringing a level 500 odd.
Ran triple torb against tracer stacking on payload.
You clearly deserve any and all wins your toxic premade gets tonight.
Oh look at this a duo-q that both roll genji.
Who really really like to hop on to the point 1v6 when 3+ of us are corpse running.
And then the classic.
> switched to hanzo was genji.
Lijiang new meta.
First 8 or so boxes only one epic so far.
Blizz are trying my patience with this lunar event.
WoW has new stuff.
OW has this one.
And HotS has it where there's a grind for a golden cock.
Just stumbled on yuyushiki how did this pass my radar so unnoticed.
2013..might have been during the time I hadn't picked anime back up again.
Make a contract with it.
Put... put your faith in it.
Are Blizz actually going with Mei's waist is a bug?
Now thats just dumb.
Did the new costume break?
No she has a thinner waste and people were campaigning for her to be changed.
Now its suddenly a bug.
Ehh. it might genuinely be a bug or was just designed poorly.
That seems made up.
Anyway MoonWolf did you see the Message to Trump on Zondag met Lubach?
Which part seems made up.
I linked it in channel even.
I've been offline.
GlennCuttlefish the waist bug.
Her new skins are rad though.
Love that i got one.
I love Snowball's bunny ears =3.
Better than my fireman skin.
I also found mercies calligrapying the floor animation.
Also ctf is fun.
Hope they don't just leave it at this and never do anything with it anymore.
Needs maps designed around it specifically to flourish.
Yeah but i love playing lucio and symmetra and ctf is like their ideal game mode.
What map is it on m.
You play it on a modified liang tower.
It works suprisingly well.
Not going to claim its super balanced or anything.
But its fun.
There is nothing balanced about this game tbh.
If only Zenyatta had a skin that replaced his orbs with hard-working hive-minded insects.
Then at least we'd have ballants.
I hate you.
Oh come the fuck on if that wasn't POTG nothing was.
It had everything action drama a sad but uplifting ending.
Rezzed half of my team while diving into a D.Va ult.
Did *they* end up also in the D.Va ult?
They lived and held the point.
Since you get a second of invuln time when rezzed.
Good res timing.
After bullshitting my way through multiple dva ults as symmetra it was easy.
Well I'd've given you PotG.
But I guess Torbjőrn's corpse just wanted it more.
I think a junk that killed 3 people with 1 ulti got it.
What a rude boy.
Rudebjörn for life.
I just realized.
At some point I have turned into mercy main.
Its not okay.
Now you do a surprising amount of damage again.
Mercy is not even the optimal healer.
You're even the optimal healer.
GlennCuttlefish its okay i'm a support main.
With a side of mei and trashperson.
Sometimes i even get to play soldier 76.
Nothing wrong in being a support main mercy is just not optimal atm.
Zenyatta all the way.
GlennCuttlefish but what if I can't do shooty games very well c.
Just play a lockon gun.
Or a beam gun.
Mair you gitgud thats what.
Maybe I could git gud if they ever let me play on Red c.
There no point in doing ctf any more.
Well except maybe if it turns out to be good XP.
Its not good xp.
Valeera great at doing 99.99999% of an enemy's health according to that match I just played.
Petition to rename Unlicensed Apothecary to Trolden Imp.
Really don't know why you'd ever run that thing.
4 games on heroes only 1 triggered the lunar event and couldn't complete it S.
Run it no get it out of atiesh/portals... D.
BwaS the lunar event is bullshit... and if you complete it but the timer elapses while the chicken in moving...
You don't get credit.
With this patternspider update tweets now look a little different.
Advantages include better emoji handeling.
Also now shows the right tweet in a tweet chain.
Thats all the advantages.
Anathema thats the raw tweet text.
Thats what the api gives me.
Html decode it.
I just closed VS.
Well at least it doesnt say *username*Verified Account anymore which is a plus in my book.
Wait that's a bullet that shoots guns that shoot more bullets. Thats pretty fuckin brilliant.
Cooked_Auto yeah now it just gives verified accounts a checkmark.
I don't know what that means.
I just see it as an alternate v.
Blame friends on skype.
Glad to see her reaction is the correct one at least.
Oh boy time to get back in the rat race that is overwatch.
GlennCuttlefish> I really loved that movie as a kid.
Don't think I have seen it.
This show presents a scenario I had not thought about before.
What happens if there are TWO dumbasses instead of the usual one in the cute girls trope group.
They try to take over the world?
MoonWolf> MairBear hint for tavern brawl this week roll shaman.
Good to know.
GlennCuttlefish what if they're all dumb ?
They usually are.
But you know that really dumb airheaded one.
Legendary in the event loot box ... and it's punk tracer.
Beating people up with chess while they play regular decks is hilarious.
My speaker jack broke off in the socket so now I am bereft of sound x.
Well I went with shaman to clear dailies and I snowballed hard those games.
I did not.
I went shaman and ended up vs a chess.
Razorgore mirror match is... bad if you go second V.
Because the hero power buffs the enemy eggs too.
MoonWolf MoonWolf.
Enemy naga lady full board of 7. One of which evolves into Unlicensed Apothecary. ... insta killing her D.
Oh hey your favourite new card.
This brawl is an amusing trifle sometimes and a real pain the other times.
Because snowballs and face decks = 90% of my opponents.
As in even when its a bad call and it obviously will lose the game for them they try to nobrain face rush.
> snowballs and face decks = 90% of my opponents.
So hearthstone then.
Oh neat.
How horrifying.
You're not a programmer until the day you make a code comment saying something along the lines of I know this is dumb but it works and I don't have time to do it right so...
Modding Bethesda games it's like Sheogorath is built into their crappy code.
Those are both incredibly true.
Gold.
“You took an eager interest in that Jedi’s explanations” said Vader in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour.
Ignoring for the moment that vader is wearing a literally all black everything.
As in mood.
It's fancy Recency talk for being angrier.
I thought it was slightly less indirect and refered to becoming red-faced.
Idiomatic though I think.
2 more boxes still only a single purple so far this event.
Something tells me I will fall short of getting most of what I want.
I haven't got any yet.
With a few boxes.
Specially since this lasts what a week?
Waitno its more.
Wonder where I got the week from.
In which case I might actually have time to practise drawing at some point after all.
Two weeks I think?
But still no luck yet.
Well this is a weird read.
Think I've got the dva bow emote but that's about it.
BwaS that feels a bit off reading it.
But it's a very outsider view.
Well that was a fun round.
Panic mercying with a head ache.
Our rein was one of those that considered it a valid tactic to patrol near the enemy door when we are defending.
I mean we won and I ended with like closer to 50% of our damage healed but still.
Really wish I could afford the game right now but I am still a few euros short from even getting a PS4 atm.
Anathema PS now htmldecodes.
Hope that makes you happy somehow.
Glenn I thought you knew about the chicken that you can win in a bowling ball game v.
Does this happen in yakuza 0?
Because I have avoided any and all information of the game so far.
Ah. But yes. This is a thing that happens in 0.
Quick give me a stereotypical RPG role.
Rogue it is.
In a surprising move I'm playing a Wizard in a future DD5e campaign.
The fact that Crystal Dynamics and the DXHR developers are involved is very interesting.
Took them long enough to try and make a game tie-in.
Been a while since last time yes.
But it also seems like they're going for an MGU instead of a movie tie-in.
!note mairbear potential balance patch coming tomorrow to increase frequency of the cock in Heroes.
Year of the rooster tie-in.
Alright just you know.
They're putting more cock in HotS.
Goddamnit this shit event drop something for once.
I am tired of 3 greys one blue boxes.
Oh how convenient red team double symmetra hollywood pt A defence.
Only one thing to do.
Kill them before they start ultiplying.
I love playing a ctf symmetra.
As does everyone else.
Preventing the C from ever happening.
Sym and torb are pretty BS in ctf.
BwaS due to the nature of hero mobility either you stop the C from happening at all or you loose.
Because once a tracer or a winston has that flag they are OUT.
Nah they can be stopped.
But that requires your offense being on point with their shit.
They kept the dragon watering scene amazing.
Woo got around to doodling something again. Still haven't got over my habit of avoiding hands it sees.
This is my show it was made for me.
Maybe I should have gone into chaoschild ep 1 being acutely aware it's a sequel to chaoshead. and having actually watched head.
What a deluge of disorganised nonsense.
Yeah sounds like a plan.
Who the fuck seriously thinks putting snipers in games is a good idea.
Fucking fun vampires in every single game.
Lucky bastards with really good eyesight massive screens fast machines and a well honed mouse sensitivity.
And steady hands.
Pinging MoonWolf for 0017 this is my show it was made for me.
You're a good friend.
Sweet Cubicle 7 got the WHFRP license.
And their major games is a Dr Who RPG and LOTR one. Hm.
They do the Laundry one too.
Suddenly Im imagining AOSFRP.
The background for AoS is just so dull.
Hey might actually make it better in the hands of competent writers.
Not to mention the planar nature of it could allow for multiple themes as well.
I want grim and perilous adventures men struggling against all odds to survive where any fight could be your last.
Preeetty sure you could cover that as well =p.
Not if the system is geared for something else.
Well I was working on the basis that the rules would be mostly unchanged or slightly updated but still keeping relatively similar.
Unless C7 is going to be using one of their own systems for it.
Well WHFRP3 is a terrible mess.
If they do a WHFRP4 it'll be a new system I think.
Well yes I imagine that the mechanics for 2nd is a whole other licensing issue to deal with so they'll probably just take whatever makes the Dr Who RPG tick.
Anyone want a copy of Day of the Tentacle Remastered or Pony Island for steam? Got spare keys.
What does the remaster add in DotT?
High resolution remastered audio and concept art browser.
With options to swap between remastered and classic elements for audio graphics and UI seperately.
Open china lootbox its a legendary get excited.
Its junker d.va.
Truly the worst of events.
Its a junk legendary GlennCuttlefish.
Junker dva was best dva until this event.
Sometimes after you respawn she says here me baby hold together 3.
I wanted new years d.va.
Instead i have junk.
Now you've used up your luck.
I got the white mei skin on my second lootbox.
That's how things work.
I'm eating all of glenns luck.
Anathema> that's canny cute.
I went with the blue spiky dva personally.
Which only gets an 'all systems buzzing' line when she calls mech.
Hear* homonyms are difficult.
Thats a shame because your language loves homonyms.
Well for once it happened that way.
Join match on last 30 seconds carry us to victory.
Ftrbzzs on Fintrade we're going to take that team from 15 to 50 people D.
!note Noelor this is neat.
Another day another lootbox I wonder how many greys in this one.
GlennCuttlefish get on my level.
Grey is the new yellow.
The background for AoS is just so dull <- don't you want to play an aelf though?
MoonWolf yeah that's cool.
I think one of the handful I found back when I was trying to random a map for Fellowship.
Its fine you can be an Aeldari instead.
Or a bonerattler.
Not a skeleton though.
We don't have those.
I mean I can afford a skin but even so there are at least 3 I would like.
Well 4 if you dont count the one I am buying anyway.
Reinhart one i assume also d.va and mei.
Which is the 4th.
Dva then hog or zen then winston actually.
I have zen and mei.
Saving for mercy really want the reinhart one though.
But i barely play him.
I have no interested in the mercy one.
But i didn't play halloween.
So no witch for me this year at least.
I played a buttload of halloween but did not get witch.
I think I ended up buying the witch.
Jesus christ that was like 5 minutes on overtime there.
MoonWolf but.... why.
I have no idea.
I've just read The Matrix described as an extended metaphor of coming out as trans.
And it's been a while since I saw those movies.
But... whut ?
There are some pretty direct lines in side stuff.
But the movies as a whole.
I don't see it.
MoonWolf D.
That is a very big number.
Now up to 25 million.
This seems silly.
We keep randoming ways to buff its health cos skelsaurus hex.
And I got the thing that summons 1/1 murlocs.
It's down to 0 now xD.
We found the overflow D.
Yu did it.
But is it an actual value overflow or just a display overflow?
I don't know if/why those would be different.
They might be and thats a good question.
MairBear you need to get hit by this 0 attack dino.
Are hydrae not dinos?
I think they are a form of dragon ?
Glad we cleared that up with science.
MoonWolf he reached fatigue before we found a way to let it attack c.
So I smacked with my 394 or so one to ensure we both fell to eye for an eye.
Apparently Ghaz' limbs are somewhat dino specifically tyrannosaur-esque.
But the faces are totally wrong being snakes.
I think warcraft hydras are listed as being old gods aligned so might be hard to be saurian.
Anguimorpha - 'snakeshped' - would be a likely infraorder for a Hydra... They fall in the larger family of scaled lizards.
Bloody hell xD.
Just saw a 5-times multiboxing BM hunter.
That is a lot of pets.
MoonWolf has it been sunny over in NL this week?
Lots of fog.
Also I know this is super late notice but do you want to get brunch in Amsterdam tomorrow?
I do not have the time for that now sorry friend.
I figured since i hadn't heard about plans yet you just wanted to do your own thing.
Never assume that I have plans =P.
Anyway tbh it's probably better if I just find somewhere to nap in Schiphol.
Given I was planning to do that tonight but can't get to sleep.
How long's your stopover?
2 hours or so i think ?
Longer than last time.
Cooked_Auto bliz edition. 6 hours. 6 HOURS. bliz edition.
How did I typo that twice anyway.
Just landed in Schiphol.
My ongoing flight isn't even on the departure boards yet =v.
MoonWolf My breakfast was a cheese and yoghurt sandwich.
Actual Dutch thing or aeroplane food ?
!note Noelor Actual Dutch thing or aeroplane food ? <- not a dutch thing.
Dutch people still real friendly.
Noelor bullshit we are not known for that.
Noelor today in trans-human lesbians a dad is upset his daughter doesn't spill deets on her girlfriend.
But you have to pretend its in spanish.
Yeah you don't need sunglasses.
Anyway I stopped for a manicure and the people there gave me a free chair massage which I checked more expensive than the manicure.
And then let me stick around for another half hour or so and nap.
Because when they asked if I minded a 45-minute wait I said I had 5hr to kill =P.
Hope you brought a good book.

Is this a K6BD joke I don't get because idr all the 6000000000 names in that series?
It just went full-on sailor moon for a page.
Like allison in a sailor moon costume and incubus in a tuxedo mask costume.
Incubus is both great.
Well he just sold allison a deal on infinite cosmic power at a vague and undetermined price.
So he'll be around a little longer!
That nearly autocorrected to Hippopotamus.
MoonWolf what us this pastry that looks like a poop.
Going to have to clarify.
I wasn't in the queue long enough get a pic.
I think it's cinnamony.
But it looked like pastry piped into a pile on top of itself.
Then covered in Brown powder.
Doesn't ring any bells to me.
I blame other non dutch cultures.
Ah yes the cool dad.
I think you mean El papá genial.
I did like...
¿Te uniste a una banda?
And we've reached the out limites of my spanish already.
You may have noticed a pause wherein I tabbed to G-Translate.
Also that last word is just the English word with an -a at the end.
Yaeh well when every part of the sentence is nonsense to you you can't go for context clues.
YAY pur..oh its just money.
You're just money!
Playing kerrigan on HotS Dragon Shire.
Hit her Ravage leap attack Q on opponent just as they got punted by the Dragon Knight.
Flew halfway across the fucking map.
The rare moments where teams actually appreciate my healing make it all worth it...almost.
Why is that even allowed.
Shoul djust force uninstall the game for two of those novas.
This week's brawl doing the given 3 choose 1 draft.
Played on braxis entire pool is SC heroes or SC theme skins.
Not sure if balanced though.
Isn't the SC pretty deficient in supports ?
You got morales for direct heals tass is shields with some heal feedback.
Though he just had a rework and havent tried him yet.
But they also add uther under his medic skin.
But it's brawl so balance goes out the window play 3 games grin and bear it 1000g and a portrait per week.
So you got nova zera stealth.

Tass uther morales trying to hold everyone together... and facecheck objective and get blown up >_<.
Oh and a murky to do murky things as well.
Did murky get a mech skin while i wasn't paying attention ?
He has one themed on the grunty blizzcon pet murky in marine armour.
Speaking of which rexxar's in as well with similar.
So fairly wide pool.
But the gameplay is full quickmatch so ppl pick stealthie whenever they have the chance.
Mecha anub'arak ?
Not technically starcraft.
Close enough honestly.
Did some colour practise for a change. lineart not mine.
Good gods second time today got complimented.
Well gwent was nice so far but it looks like i'm not playing that much untill beta ends.
Since they are wiping all progress at the end of beta.
Finally a new years legendary...and its mei.
Mei is the one I wanted the least.
Well after rein.
Well that sucks.
But its still a good legendary.
Certainly better than the christmas one.
Anyone want 80 hearthstone gold?
BwaS i'll trade you mine for yours.
I also need a spectator win incidentally.
Ana was a mistake.
Just about all of recent balancing problems could have been avoided by not adding ana in the first place.
I am not even joking.
Who the fuck decided that a healer should be able to kill anyone they get one hit on?
I see where youre coming from yeh.
I never land a sleep dart.
MoonWolf> kazakus potion in renolock.
Opponent ended up doing PO trade doomsayer shadowflame.
How can they think hog is in any way shape or form balanced.
It's brood war levels of balance.
Everyone has their own bit of broken and unfair bollocks.
Dont you just love teams that are afraid of passing the gate in kings row.
No i hate them with a passion.
Fucking push them break their damn support line.
Getting 1 kill every 10 seconds isn't going to do shit.
I thought Uranium got lawyered to death?
This was a stream recorded very soon after launch.
We are being audited this week it seems.
Not sure but it's the same 3 auditors that have done it a few times before.
Anathema one of the few auditing companies most likely pwc?
In todays terrible doodles a cat thing.
Cat thing is a good description.
I just cant get proportions right somehow. something in my brain always seems to rebel.
Yaay cat thing!
Accidentally read this instead of working.
I accidentally read a 20 minute read article.
Anathema it tells us something about your work.
I would also spend 20 minutes on reading that article rather than..
MoonWolf are you aware of Polygon's series Touch the Skyrim?
This sounds like its going to be about horrible porn mods or something.
A play through of Skyrim with an increasing number of mods added each episode.
Oh i remember that now.
I watched like two of those.
Anyway the first mod is trees are hands.
I don't even know where they found that one.
My brother is showing me it.
Its not exactly a well known mod.
You don't say.
I do I do say.
I'm saying right now.
Well ok then.
They scare people!
Oh god the tree hands have fingernails.
I mean obviously.
Oh Majora's Mask moon.
I think they added Cabbage Guy's cabbages?
The skeleton mod rather than create first-person skeleton hand assets.
Just has invisible hands.
And I didn't notice until they were wielding spells.
Its more immersive.
I mean how often do you look at your hands while you do things.
YOU CAN PLAY AS A SKELETON!?
Like the first month.
Skeleton was already a setup race.
Does it work with the sex mods? can you still bone people?
But you know.
You're a skeleton.
He can still get a boner.
Only if you install dongs of skyrim.
And that'd probably look really weird.
Mandatory for those mods anyway.
ACKNOWLEDGE MY TERRIBLE PUN.
Anathema it was very funny.
Also The Bee Movie Script.
Ftrbzzs don't lie to him.
Noelor but I have bad sense of humour so it matches his.
Based on a sample size of 2 I can conclude that all Finnish people like puns.
Made for each other that's for sure.
Anathema must be a cultural thing.
They... added a giant bear to Whiterun.
Just as a boss that's what's there.
Omg Project PEW MoonWolf.
Noelor its great though.
There is one for fallout 4 too.
Anathema one of our more popular news paper comics is all about puns.
Nothing but puns.
Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot is a follower now.
I'd forgotten the dunmer lady.
This is basically her whole character.
Tough dunmer lady.
But all Dunmen sound like they smoke 40 a day so they always sound tough.
Incidentally this is why skyrim has like 4 dunmer characters with more than generic dialogue.
Or maybe that's just what living in Vvardenfall does to you.
Because it turns out sounding like solid snake is HELL on your voice.
Unless you are Elias Toufexis.
What he sounds like that normally ?
The fuck happened to him.
Did you get punched in the troat as a kid or something ?
Cooked_Auto what even.
Apparantly there is a mime festival in Cambridge next weekend.
Anathema they kept that quiet.
Meanwhile in Skyrim everything started drifting very slowly eastward.
For no readily apparent reason.
Okay i think you're beyond what i've seen now.
The skeleton of a Thomas the Tank Engine is a coal cart.
Makes sense to me.
Good weather over there in japan.
They accidentally turned Skyrim into a time lapse with console commands.
Also that made ragdolls act even crazier presumably because physics is tied to time.
There is a mod that makes Whiterun xmassy.
Complete with a Xmas arm.
There is actually a really nice mod that gives skyrim a ton of individual lore friendly festivals based on ingame date.
So they're not using that one.
All the ai scripts are based on time right ?
More or less.
They still have the world time at... idk 10x.
Okay so there is two levels too that it has an ai that says at ingame hour x be here to do y.
Also NPCs are leaving their houses walking 5 steps then turning around.
And thats usually stuff like sit in this throne look like your eating at this table sleep in this bed.
But that still happens in normal game movement time.
So if you set the ingame speed to ridiculous.
They'll just be constantly switching job.
Yeah that one.
Mod installed Za Warudo.
That'll be good.
I did not realise Skyrim's engine was capable of freezing time.
Give it 50% chance it'll have dropping mamoths on people while time is stopped.
Sure its been a spell effect since oblivion.
Its actually a shout.
Its called stop time.
Za Warudo just lets you stop time at will so far as I can tell.
I was really hoping to drop mammoths of people.
And leave it stopped for as long as you like.
Didn't za warudo have a pretty strict time limit though ?
Physics is also paused so you can shoot all the arrows and they'll not actually fly until you release.
Yeah 5s or something.
Because JoJo initially couldn't stay active for the full duration Dio froze.
If Dio just used his stand properly instead of being a gloating badguy nobody would have ever stood a chance.
That said if Jojo used *his* stand properly instead of being a gloating shounen protagonist Dio would have killed a handful fewer people.
Nobody's blame-free here.
I... guess ?
Last panel of today's EGS btw.
Which one ?
Elliott's smart people.
Playing against roadhog is like watching badly translated anime.
It cant be helped.
You start seeing katakana flying down the left side of your screen?
There are translators notes ?
MoonWolf> rogue random class card effect v mage. into spellslinger. into bane of doom. into doomguard.
So much value.
It got 5 to face but got poly'd next turn.
Helped set up a rag lethal tho.
Give it another year they'll relase the HD eddition.
Its that plus a slightly better shader.
Oh boy had one of those moments.
We were defending the point just fine.
And then suddenly my whole team runs away chasing after who knows what.
Red mist is a terrible drug.
I will admit to being a user.
Goddamnit blue team.
Also why does getting a character I can use well in all random mean I give the enemy pinpoint accuracy for that life x.
Well that was a round.
27% of team damage taken.
I am not saying these guys liked standing in fire.
I had one of those dvas on gibraltar lately.
Stood in attackers tunnel just shooting at like a mccree or reaper on the high ground opposite over the payload.
Bahaha getting carded as lucio for healing in double support.
When I spent half the time green rather than yellow.
Nucleon looks cooler than it should.
But also is just stronger than any other eeveelution.
Because of course it is.
The Great Vagina Bones Heist of 2016 I'm excited to see where this goes.
Fan game has balance issues.
Alert the media p.
Today's recommendation this insanity.
Ft the cast of Let's Play Cubivore and some very poorly animated... Scots?
Damnit cubivore people.
I just want more flaps.
Noelor this is some early CG alright.
MoonWolf Dragon Lore is actually already finished recording it was Fae's pattern-only thing for a while now being released to the general public via I think the Casual LP thread?
MoonWolf resuming Touch the Skyrim with broelor.
They installed a kissing mod.
At least its not a sex animations mod.
It does not work well with the skeleton mod.
This does not suprise me.
Unrelated the sky is water now.
Did they install tha skyrim is underwater thing ?
Plus a second mod that... does something similar ?
Or affects how underwater works.
Anyway the Dark Brotherhood can't give them a letter any more.
Because the courier is swimming.
Oh no.
At some point they installed a mod to give Chinese gui elements.
But because they did not also install a language pack the gui is just full of boxes.
Why did they install a chinese ui ?
I mean why any of this.
There seems to be relativly little entertainmnet value in a chinese ui.
I guess they were hoping it would affect character and/or monster names.
Cooked_Auto someone was demonstrating a bug in another channel.
Welp v.
Mumble plugin has been removed for the time being because getting it to load the proper fucking .dll's each time i update it is too much of pain.
I can see that.
But what if I really need to see who is on mumble and dont want to spend time just clicking on that icon right there.
I'll write a new one.
Not in fucking f#.
Because anathema is a little functional snowflake.
Cooked_Auto good news Trump fixed the f-35.
Yeah no he didn't p.
Presumably with his ability to magically fix garbagefires.
He switched one imaginary number for another one.
Its totally fixed and all the issues will be gone now it definitly isn't still just as broken as before.
MoonWolf not my fault you don't know how to write assembly redirects p.
Maybe the .dll's it provides me with when i build should just work.
Especialy since it does work in debug.
So 2 legendaries in last 2 crates.
Both duplicates of what I had.
Well that was a quick round for me.
Get in see enemy has 2 hogs winston mccree and a mercy.
Noped the fuck out of there.
Look at that a couple of players left red team.
Better do some...
Matchmaking just gotten worse for me lately.
Keep getting the complete absolute 'my account is 1hr old' players on blue.
Balanced by red having equal level blatant smurf scumbag.
Well at least you're getting progression to loot boxes in the first place.
Blue team goes for hard stacking immediately countered.
Red team goes for hard stacking blue team plays vanilla.
Second time today I quit when I was against a stacked red team.
Full of hogs.
And one rebel lucio.
It couldn't be helped.
Quick give me an expression to draw.
Marvellous get rolling numbani def with necessary evil stack.
Annnnnd the exe crashes.
At least not a bsod this time >_>.
Todays drawing didnt really produce anything useful but at least it passes time.
The only thing mysterious about mystery heroes is why I keep rolling hanzo in it...
This on 66 attack with 3 sombrero.
We somehow won.
There finally finished shirt removal simulator 1.
The project got kinda delayed when my emulator glitches out and I had to redo a really infuriating boss fight.
Onwards to yakuza 2 in a hour or two.
Anathema dyk people are still playing PSO on pc?
I hope not.
Also its quite past ana bedtime.
30 seconds in women slapped 1.
I love calling a mage's bluff sometimes.
Drop a babbling book into 2 secrets oh mirror entity and potion of polymorph.
I need that minion.
Damn no Noelor to appreciate it.
Noelor oh no.
!note bwas.
Noelor I was in bed but yes I am aware. I know that my brother was still playing it in at least 2015.
So good.
CHECK YOUR BACKUPS PERIODICALLY.
Don't just blindly truts them.
> handful of random shell scripts.
I'll add to that facepalm.
Yep its a real yakuza now.
Trying to learn mahjong. again. for the...fourth time now?
Hey look this one does not break.
Shin Megami Tensei got its start writing fanfiction of a trashy japanese novel where loki fucks seven women ???
Also goood. morning ? i think.
I'm great at timezones.
Browsing LP before bed.
If my phone didn't give me home time in the lock screen I'd constantly be way off.
I have a central time for america setup in windows as an additional time on the clock.
Not so much japan.
It's the opposite direction.
Yeah but i always feel like japan is closer to america than it is.
Yeah not so much.
I blame maps.
Also map edges are not exactly good for showing how the wrap around actually is size wise.
Anyway with that anime mystery remaining such I'm-a sleep.
I love the vegan rap at the end of this death metal song.
I didn't sing up for rap with my deathmetal.
It's really good though.
I would listen to a whole album of that.
Well there is a lot of rap on the internet.
So you probably can.
There is a discovery problem though.
So there's the new yugioh movie on tonight.
Still a surprising amount of seats at the newcastle screening.
Weirding me out as your name was packed out.
Why does coffee make me sleepy this is the opposite of what it should do.
Dunno. used to happen to me occasionally.
Oh I hope not.
Its filled with spikes.
Oh I really hope not.
Really wish skytorrents had some level of catogory filtering.
Speaking of which is berseria cracked yet.
...I click on tile tile goes away I can steal enemy tiles?
I have a seemingly valid hand.
Why isn't it working.
Did I forget to spin around 2.5 times while singing the national anthem for uruguay at some point?
Maybe its the wrong month for this hand to work? I dont know.
GlennCuttlefish what ar eyou doing ?
GlennCuttlefish have you tried going super sayin first ?
Just had one of the best HS games on ladder in a long time.
Priest mirror nzoth v dragon. but ended up being dragon v dragon practically.
Basically went to fatigue and blueballing azure drakes and northshires to avoid the card draw.
Only took 45 minutes ?
Maybe not that long.
How to play japanese mahjong oh good. this video is only 3½ hours.
...oh good just the phrase I wanted to hear the rules are myriad and complicated.
...for fucks sake. I've watched 3 videos in last few minutes.
NONE OF THEM HAVE EVEN AGREED HOW MANY PIECES THERE ARE IN THIS GAME.
Jesus christ even the seating in this game is backwards.
So the player who draws the east tile determines the seating right? So east sits down...and south sits right of east.
Oh wait. this step was literally pointless.
Or you could just have the players sit where ever. now heres actual rules.
I swear to gods I will have some kind of physical meltdown over this.
Finish man reduced to literal puddle of rage over mahjong.
Sounds like my Canadian friend and XCOM2 v.
I am not angry.
I'm confused and frustrated.
Wait did I somehow completely miss last weeks dragon maid.
I must have since I have no idea of who these chracters are.
Last week they moved house.
And they had the classic draogn watering scene.
Even the lolis are raging lesbians it seems.
Yep missed it then.
Well sadly I dont have time to watch it now.
Jesus christ I finally won.
...the easy round.
Great now i have red mei too.
Didn't want red mei.
Would have prefered any other event skin.
At least I got the white mei.
Stupid time being so finite c.
Well that yugioh movie was all kinds of stupid.
Pretty long though.
Bloody control matchups.
It is yugioh.
A series in which I thought the abridged version was exaggerating things untill I saw the real deal.
Check his pulse glenny.
This game is basically what if twewy persona 4 and a jpop group got stuck in a blender.
Okay just beat a reno kazakus mage at rank 20.
Who finished off with jaraxxus.
Idk if anyone else will find that appealing but here it is.
You know what's good in dragon priest against a reno deck? them unable to answer your second ysera.
I think opponent doesn't have an answer for this is good in any deck.
But yes Ysera seems especially enjoyable.
MoonWolf I'm reading Radch 2 btw.
MoonWolf national dick festival.
Piles of dicks.
!note Noelor MoonWolf national dick festival. <- its basically that weird japanese festival in my head.
Japan is nice except for when I buy sushi and then when I eat the sushi it tastes foul and I have no idea what it is our hours to avoid more of it.
Wait which Japanese festival???
This thing.
Anyway yeah basically.
But with a pile of dicks instead of one big metal one I guess.
Its not not erotic because everyone keeps their gloves on.
Also everyone fucks in this book goddamn.
Just most people.
As is the medic I think.
So everyone who is not an ex-spaceship or doctor fucks.
Including the ancillaries.
I like Breq's interactions with her new ship incidentally.
Spoilers everyone involved in the Breq/Ship/Seivaarden situation is Terrible At Feelings.
Which is impressive on Breqs side because they literally have the ability to constantly be aware of Seivaardens feelings.
It's hardly Tales of Graces.
Also as a dumb sidenote Ships it is revealed not sure in which book have a hobby. Its shipping other people.
I'd noticed that of Breq.
Was not aware it was a common ship trait.
I felt it was portrayed as one.
But its been a while.
Also I'm generally pretty happy internally pronouncing the various proper nouns however.
With the aa's and aai's.
But Tstur? Really?
Whats wrong with tstur.
Too much consonant together.
Guess we won't have to make a discord afterall.
Wow that is just... awkward.
Welp back to being poor.
But at least I now have a PS4 ordered.
In the news today a time capsule buried by kids' tv show blue peter at the millennium dome in 98 was accidentally unearthed after they lost track of its location.
Still had 30 years left to go.
I mean how do you lose one of them?
Sometimes you just do.
Didn't even know that was happening.
Anyway I finished Radch 2 yesterday MoonWolf.
Waht'd you think ?
Very part two of three ending but otherwise.
Yeah 1 was a pretty standalone ending.
2 very much is not.
Also Tisarwat is a great character.
Neocolonialisn is a map of Tokyo covered in kanji and kana I cannot read.
And then just north of the station Denny's.
Today's Engrish three bottles on a shelf in the shower.
Why is this piece of shit game running slow this time.
Look at the temperature 98c.
I wonder if my fans are dying or something I just cleaned them a month ago.
Yeah mine runs around there a lot of the time.
This is a going on 4 yrs old laptop though.
!note Noelor.
Fucking laggy valeeras.
The FUCK are you doing with D3.
You sort of had a good idea with ancient items.
But we don't need super primal ancient items.
This is a terrible idea.
Walked past a lingerie pub earlier.
Honestly it's the pub part of that combo that concerns me.
That is a very japanese thing.
Maybe they were going for linger-y.
And no it's Japan.
They might define pub differently to how I would though.
Where abouts is it you're travelling through? o.
Then Sendai Sapporo Seoul.
Anyway also iirc sports entertainment is how pro wrestling advertises itself right?
Here that is bowling darts etc.
I mean then you could then start crying foul that they're GWs pet chapter a bit.
Well he's the most likely one from the lore other than maybe Vulcan reappearing.
Then again Corax went AWOL and Lion El is in seclusion in the Rock afaik.
Dorn is also AWOL for that part and Khan is rumored to be in Comorragh. Which considering the current plotline would also be a very likely candidate to return.
The new CYpher is not too bad either.
!note Noelor Here comes the CLAMP.
Little bored of all these last-season-legend reno kazakus 30 minute game decks at the bottom of the ladder.
Yea they may or may not be working on that.
So in another 9 months.
If you're lucky.
Oh great 40k are being dumb with their lore again.
Can i get cliff notes on how its dumb ?
A loyalist Primarch is returning.
Something something Age of Emperor something something End Times.
Huh Lucio is coming for HoTS.
But can he wallride ?
You be the judge.
Hate this week's heroes brawl so so much.
Encourages bad bad play and talent selection and the complete antithesis of how to normally play the hero.
What is it ?
5v5 all sgt hammer.
Here's a hint ambush hammer is not a thing.
Sure it is.
This is the one in a thousand case where they wouldn't get punished for it.
Not sure if all hammers games would be gridinly slow of stuper fast.
The last iteration was slow as fuck.
They 'improved' it by halfing core health on Towers map and slingshotting to 10 at start.
But ofc the matchmaking is a clusterfuck.
Blue team with a literal level 5 red team a full stack premade that got lost trying to find team league.
Hey guys how about we do a game of brawl as warmup.
!note MairBear.
GlennCuttlefish the hell are those mounts.
I dont know.
MoonWolf niskryaception.
We have to go deeper ?
Fallout 4 dialogue is disappointing so far.
Like my character just saw a walking mountain of angry claws and flesh just burst out of the ground and slaughter a bunch of bandits before turning on me.
And I cant even ask WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE.
Naw man you were too busy going hero mode in power armour.
And then... pvp happened C.
!note MoonWolf I'm in akihabara and I just found a keychain of the blacksmith lady Precia? from frickin' Rayearth.
!note bwas wait do the kancolle boatwaifus punch each other with cannon batteries?
There's keychains of everything.
!note MoonWolf update I found some of the girls also for some reason they are each associated with a suit of playing cards?
MairBear my LRT.
!note MoonWolf also I think there's a Fate / Grand Order anime coming out in March?
How the smeg is Cyber Dimension Neptune still a thing ???
Or however that title got translated.
The game based on console-tans from two-three generations ago.
Lol newest DX on steam at 70% off.
Omg I'd forgotten if I knew about Figma's model of Münch's The Scream.
A thing of beauty.
Tank mass pulls in the latest top difficulty 5 man doesn't bother agroing ranged mobs.
Pulls 4 groups Healer dies from agro. Tries again fails again rage quiets the group... rather than slowing down or y'know performing his role corrctly.
Trying to do picross with pencil and paper was a mistake.
Without a proper rubber.
My mistakes have made everything a blurry mess.
!note MoonWolf I'm in akihabara and I just found a keychain of the blacksmith lady Precia? from frickin' Rayearth.
Noelor Note by MoonWolf from 14 Hours ago Here comes the CLAMP.
Well that was a good combination.
Why did that all double.
I enjoyed that as a response =P.
Yeah i'm not sure why it doubled.
FGO is real big here incidentally.
Soooo much merch for it minimal for actual FSN.
They made it popular by making it maximum waifu.
When you're a flying farah and lucio keeps shooting you in the face.
MULTI CLASSING.
This is an okay multi classing system.
Fix your game Jake. Fix. Your. Gaaaaaameeeee.
Legs bug ?
Fallout 4 just crashed.
I'm sorry glenn.
But that is giggle-worthy.
Its fine it has quick save. and autosaves every time I exit inventory.
*gets punched in the face by a deathclaw as you exist the inventory*.
And thats why I save between every kill.
Hollandrians v.
Fucking denmarkins can't do anything original.
!note noelor re boatwaifus punching with cannon batteries not sure if I remember that part. Some did carry them on their wrist though.
It's okay they aren't alone.
I will properly check it out once I have my amp connected to the pc again.
No sound atm.
There's also this Cooked_Auto for all the other countries' offerings.
Yeah the dane video mentioned it.
...well that went well.
I have to help this dude win a bar fight.
So we go there start the fight suddenly he pulls out a gun and murders the fuck out of those people.
And then the bar owner yells at me.
I have to appreciate how this man is rapidly losing more salt than his body should have and yet he remains so calm.
To the video clip earlier.
Problem with /v/ awards is that there is always that one game that sweeps everything.
Except in the new IP category in which va-11 hall-a somehow beat everything including overwatch. I mean I agree with that but I expected overwatch to win in todays /v/.
Also I am reminded again that /v/ does not understand the word pretentious since no mans sky won the most pretentious game category.
That wasn't pretentious just utterly failed to live up to its hype.
Which other ones were in the running for pretentiousness?
!Note MoonWolf.
I am intently disappointed that someone else got to the 2030 joke before me.
Dammit iirc client.
BwaS I don't understand why you'd have guns on your wrist if you aren't going to punch someone with them.
Boatwaifus continuing to disappoint me.
Maybe there's some that go kinda aggro and up in the abyssals' faces with them.
But I guess it's about aiming flexibility beyond wiggling hips/rotating shoulders/bending over sideways.
This is anime.
They will 100% be posing anyway.
RWBY > Kancolle regardless.
Entirely due to understanding what you do with find strapped to your wrists.
Find = guns.
Rwby did a bit better at killing off a character and have it mean or advance something.
..what I just started overwatch and right from idle my computer claims 97c.
Fuck it time to run this to the ground lets see what happens if I try actually playing.
...what happens is my temperatures went down.
Probably just the boot up process.
Oh boy oh boy oh boy the FF thread is discussiong Shadowrun. This will be fun.
Thats a good opening line.
Well I'm not saying it isnt.
Fucking math goblins.
Basically scum of the earth.
Things i could do without my current cold the associated headache.
MoonWolf oh god.
The dancing quests.
I spent 30 minutes trying to find the last quest thing in the area.
Then I realized it was just bugged.
Fortunately I was easily able to progress by beating the required npc out of the ground he waas stuck into.
MairBear why are you even involved with sylphs agai.
Are you grinding rep ?
Created a new character to join with some friends. As I am both a cheap bastard when it comes to transfer and also don't want to just up and leave that guild out of the blue.
I may yet end up just transferring if it looks like no one's coming back for stormblood -but- if the guild defies what happened to my WoW ones. Every time....
Long story short. Why exactly are regions still a thing.
I have no idea.
I get that your game may nto support literally everyone being on the same physical server.
At least FF15 did cross server invites now.
But i should just be able to play with anyone who is also playing your game.
Or chat with them.
But that's within each individual block as it were. So while there's what 20 servers on the one NA shard. You're still isolated from the other NA shard. And same for the other spots.
Now physical ocations are still a tihng and i can understand that yeah if you want to play with your friend sin fucking australia prepare for lag.
But thats not a thing i expect anyone to fix.
Indeed. Now if my guild were assholes or boring I'd not have a problem.
I'd just spend money and move.
Stupid people being likable damnit.
Sure is fun going from 'watching HGC' heroes meta back to 'playing hero league' heroes meta xD.
Well I have now reached the point it seems where enemies have become damage sponges.
You'd think that a sniper sneak shot would kill a normal bandit but nope.
Now I remember why I stopped doing this.
The people who queue ranked who can only fill limited limited role options.
I am not sure how much longer I can keep watching this show.
Its fine and all that but the phrase this girl is not going to anime heaven keeps playing in my head ll the goddamn time.
I don'tthink anyone hsould go to anime heaven.
That sounds like a terrible place.
It has its merits.
There are no bullies in anime heaven.
Playing 76 and the ana gives a stim drone. pop tac vis. annnnnnd the tiny glimmer of red team immediately vanish off the map.
Cooked_Auto MoonWolf this morning I washed in a shower with a basin-ceiling height of ~180cm.
I don't even FIT in there.
I barely did.
You are a tiny tiny person.
But still on the higher end in asia probably.
China has some tall people historically from particular regions.
See these are asia facts i just don't know.
...175cm is tiny now?
!note MoonWolf Translator Zeiat is my problematic fave.
Omg medicine + cycling in cold weather = finally can breath through my nose again.
MoonWolf it happened again.
What did ?
A voice actor in FFXIV said a line in an amusing way.
And now it became a meme.
The boss at the last MSQ dungeon has an ability that he uses eveyr 30 seconds or so. And the Eng Dub voice line for the attack ...
Is good voice acting that is certainly not going to be a dumb joke i wont understand 2 weeks from now ?
He just says Sloppy but the delivery on it is rather memorable xP.
And I have done the dungeon but I didn't have Eng dub so I missed it entirely and had no idea what my FC/the FF reddit were on about.
I assume it will die out before too long.
No other boss will beat Malachai's *YOU* are being selfish!
You would say that.
Noelor have you met sphene yet ?
I finished the series on the train today.
Sphene is actually my problematic fave.
We need a sphene trilogy.
Zeiat can come.
MoonWolf it's the most memorable part of the fight.
Omg I got through three courses of this meal before I realised where the chopsticks were >.<.
Bad thing about listening to stoner metal ridiculous band / song names.
Eg 'Diabolical Dopenosis by Belzebong'.
Noelor great shame a terrible dishonor.
Why are you listening to this ?
The music is good.
It's good background.
Also I actaully wanted sludge metal but there is a big overlap between stoner and sludge.
This all sounds made up.
Sludge metal.
There is better ways to work out your beard fetish people.
Wow lots of toxic masculinity there.
In scary grown-up world news I've been invited to the wedding of one of my best friends - as a bridesfolk.
The social anxiety may kill me long before the wedding happens.
Unrelated is chanserv still down from the other day?
You're not a mod.
I'd have to rejoin.
Also autocorrect nearly turned that into a question about Chansey.
Well maybe if you took your chansey to the pokecentre it'd be up now.
This picture seems to beshipping d.va bird with sombra bird.
Sorry not d.va.
I'm great at names.
Just the best.
Trump like levels of good.
Well Holland is after all second.
Symmetra/Sombra makes less sense.
But a ship for every port I suppose.
Talking of which.
Ships enjoying shipping is confirmed mid-book 3.
When Breq her ship and Seivarden 2 of whom are very drugged sort-of sort out their collective feelings.
Seivaarden managed to fuck up her way into one hell of a relationship.
Feelings are rubbish |.
Anyway Seivarden is like I thought this was just a Breq thing but I guess it's all ships after all.
Its frankly impressive how bad Breq is at feelings with regards to Seivaarden considering the literal ability to read her emotions.
Ship and Ekalu are the only bloody adults on that whole ship.
Also several of the decades.
I've forgotten ship's name and therefore that of Breq's decade.
But her five The One Who Likes Fancy Tea Sets.
Is a good character imo.
Breq is Justice of Toren specifically One Esk Ninteen.
Ship is Mercy of Kalr.
Kalr Five then.
Kalr Five very politly raided the imperial tea sets #lifegoals.
The bit where she and Sphene are reassembling the tea set older than Breq was cute.
I kept hoping for Breq/Sphene or Five/Sphene to go somewhere but it never materialized.
Just Sphene hanging out with Zeiat because she likes to see weird shit happen i guess.
Sphene x Zeiat otp?
Nah i don't think so.
Trolling humanity together.
But i don't think Zeiat even gets romance.
I put the ? there for a few reasons.
Beginning to suspect this isn't a cold but actually flue.
Which is Great.
Ok so I get to my hotel room in Sapporo and there's a magazine on the table - standard here's what's on in town here's a list of restaurants stuff.
I decide to flip through the restaurant part see if there's anywhere that looks good rather than my just wandering down the road.
And then I reach the end of the magazine...
Hey half of them are wearing supe rclassy kimonos.
Something something eating out.
Waitaminute.. club taiga that looks nothing like toradora.
You've lost me.
Oh that somehow reminds me.
MoonWolf I spotted a very cute model of Saber in Akihabara.
And took pictures ?
This one.
No because they don't like you taking pictures in those shops =<.
But she was wearing pyjamas and holding a toothbrush and a mug.
I am watching the iplayer vod of the rugby from last night.
The halftime rock concert is pretty batshit.
And the mug had a lion's face and gao gao on it.
It was very =3.
MoonWolf re Twitter.
Not super cold then.
Well not for Sapporo.
But I'm obviously a tourist.
See that's where I was day before yesterday.
Just curious if it default to tokyo.
No it doesn't.
That's where I was yesterday where there were remains of snow visible in some places but none actually on roads or pavement.
You're going towards the cold.
I know this is not how it works.
Here in Sapporo the pavements are several cm higher than usual.
Because there's just a layer of snowy ice there.
I say usual idk maybe they're just always that way.
Maybe they don't have real pavements here.
Poor sapporo people. don't even have real pavement.
BwaS' sister is still way too invested in our mutual high school.
She just liked the following post on Facebook Well done to our U9 and U11 chess teams who came third in the English Primary Schools Chess Association competition on Saturday!
Unsure how widely used this convention is so in case unclear U is for under in this context and denotes an age bracket.
Actually on that note.
The under 11's... those rapid packs of puppies they don't even keep on the same site?
BwaS did I ask you about the alumni do at the Counties Club in town?
But don't read too much into what people hit the like button on on fb from following some fanpage.
BwaS U11 are main school U9 are over the moor.
BwaS it's that she's even following them.
That she Liked that in particular is secondary.
I don't think it's too abnormal to like the page of your old school.
And yeah alumni networking not really my scene sorry.
I was tempted to go only because it's the clerb.
And the thought of arriving thence with my hair and nails and I'd probs do my face up a bit too and seeing the looks on the sorts of people there...
But if you don't want to go then probs not.
MoonWolf did you FO4 at all?
Very narrow field of people who I'd be half-interested in seeing and zero guarantee of them attending.
I've been to those gigs where those things don't align and it's never fun.
Dan Shive's been messing around with its items.
Only 4 hats take ballistic weave because they nver really thought the weave layer of item crafting through.
Is the real awnser.
A heavy portion of his Twitter feed is ranting about FO4 modding.
Wait is ballistic weave from the base game?
Also re dan's twitter stuff from yesterday.
Extrapolating the speed of the comic and its increasingly slow pace.
It'll reach uni by the time I'M DEAD FROM OLD AGE.
I thought it was added by a mod.
Anathema its railroad only.
There are mods that make it avialable outside of the railroad because well.
Its objectivly the best faction.
Because of that.
Jackets as tough as metal armour.
Omg this guy talks so much.
Which guy ?
Oooh one of those over-lunchtime voip sessions! I love those!
Yeah it's getting ridic.
Was booked for 30m.
Anathema tell them that you have another appointment and bye.
That's what I say if my meetings overrun.
Anathema next time.
Ftrbzzs we can see each other's outlook calendars p.
Anathema juts put lots of private events.
Also there are discussions that take place outside of your calendar.
You know all those important coffee break discussions.
Do you still remember anathema?!
Sure I'll ship it.
I mean hella crackship.
And obviously unhealthy but still.
Anathema I echo what ftrbzzs said.
Put in private events on your calendar for like.
'call the vet' 'make that appointment for thing X' 'call grandma'.
I have the first 1.5 hours of my every workday blocked out.
Good time management.
It's so I can actually hit daily deadlines.
My Lync business Skype flags me as busy people outside my team aren't inclined to invite me to meetings it's just generally a great boon for my productivity.
Noelor> it's quite simple wrathion's a dragon deck card and mostly priests play dragons.
Noelor I just say 'no'.
With an angry face.
Ftrbzzs alas I'm too English for that.
Getting better as I grow older though.
Noelor UK taught me sarcasm and I hopefully taught the UK some direct communication.
But why are they also genderbended.
Her Majesty is cheating.
A symbolic 65 yr portrait taken 3 years ago.
Noelor UK taught me sarcasm and I hopefully taught the UK some direct communication <- you hope in vain.
Me to broelor I can't find that email from dad do you have it?
Broelor to me «dad's email address».
Broelor is helping.
Ftrbzzs I have a conversation wit an imaginary you whenever I make coffee.
MoonWolf well there was actually someone in the UK who was more direct than me.
Which is already something.
But it's the little things like answering truthfully when someone asks 'how are you doing'.
Anathema I'm sure these conversations are great.
Do you change your voice accordingly too?
In my head.
Chirpy ftrbzzs inside your head.
Did you really think I would speak /aloud/ when I didn't have to!?
If you speak to yourself it's fine right?
Right? or is this why everyone gives me silly looks?
I didn't say what question I was answering.
That's why I said reassuring.
Oh I thought you were using your newly learned sarcasm.
Anathema I was.
Oh look. fallout crashed again.
I'm amazed skyrim enhanced hasn't crashed on me yet.
Still no skse mods though.
So the ui is shit.
Anathema I wouldn't be so bitchy about it.
IF I WASN'T PLAYING ON A CONSOLE.
Do FO4 / SKEE on console get mods?
Which was a whole new clusterfuck in its own right.
Because bethseda had no policing on its new console mod system.
So people just uploaded whatever mods they wanted to have on there.
Just downright stole mods.
And i do mean stole as in took a mod reuploaded it credited it to them.
What feature do yuo think they will remove from the next TES game?
Cant remove what wasn't there.
I need to add more skyrim mods.
MoonWolf it's OK to add-in most mods to an existing save yeah? it's removing them that fucks you up?
So my other group planning to do a Shadowrun game set in Vladivostok and I'm going to be playing the wheelman. My current idea is a Finnish rally driver v.
Huh i have 105 chaos and a exalted orb. guess i'm not PoE broke anymore.
What's the ce ratio atm?
Anathema around 35C in softcore breach.
Wow that's low.
I wouldn't know.
Last time I played it peaked at 1001 but that was around the time of the secret crafting method controvosy.
Remind me what that was.
Some people discovered a way to craft great items kept it secret actively mislead other people to keep it secret made massive profits crafting great items.
It consumed Exalts so there was less Exalts in the market so the exchange rate rose pretty high.
Mr Trump continues to survive off chocolate chips steaks and Diet Coke hopefully he'll be dead soon.
This diet seems to lack anything that might be described as a vegetable or fruit.
Also doesn't the whitehouse come with a fucking chef ?
Shouldn't be that hard to get a balanced diet if there is someone whose job it is to get you and your family food.
He thinks he has special DNA so he doesn't need to eat properly.
Presidency is going to fucking eat him alive.
He has special dna thats why he takes statins to lower his cholesterol.
Because his body is special.
Well he isn't known for logical thinking.
I don't mind if the president wants to eat a bigmac you have shit taste in fast food but whatever.
But why are you going to be so fucking self important to get it served on a silver plate.
Your eating fast food eat it from a wrapper like a human being.
You too have shit taste in fast food.
Fuck fastfood chains.
I don't eat them often for obvious reasons but they are good.
Go to your local place that sells chips and get a burger there.
Probably much better.
Sure it is.
Doesn't mean a big mac isn't tasty too though and you know costs 1/3 as much p.
Skywind are terrible they re-implemented clifracers.
Our engine is outdated and patchwork.
Ladders are hard.
Wonder if we'll get TES6 before 2020.
Depends on if they started pre-production before they finished fallout 4.
Considering it'll probably use just about the same engine I assume they did.
No pre-production is very different from engine use.
Maybe but I figured it'll save on time regardless.
Anathema They apparently showed off Adeptus Titanicus at the HH weekender.
Look it was late ok.
Dunno why I picked DRG and then MNK instead on NIN. Hand Jiving is fun.
You know what HOTS needed.
For murky to be dota 2 techies.
Have to do sidequests to level up for next main story mission.
1-40 without doing any sidequest rubbish.
That'll be long an dboring grinding.
Eeeh or I could jsut do Palace of the Dead.
That seems very similar to Arrow.
Except the protagonist is nowhere near as pretty.
Anathema does arrow have an axe gang though.
I would have thought shock treatment would not be allowed in retrofuturistic hospitals.
But there I was getting quite the shock when I rounded the corner in this hospital and ran into a deathclaw.
Deathclaws are not that scary tbh.
They are when they are right next to you.
And I am playing a build with..2 endurance.
Apparently I accidentally hired a junkie to one of my settlements. There I was thinking what am I going to do with a junkie.
Then I remembered.
I have an artillery spot open in that one place.
Build a halfway there reno mage deck.
Take it to casual to give it a test drive.
End up against a unicorn priest.
Where everyone can live out their 0-0 draws with a bastion symmetra camp in peace.
Finally an OW event legendary skin.
Too bad it's zen.
Could be worse though.
I wish I had the zen one.
But noo I get duplicate mei ones.
Of the new one?
Omg sleepmakeswaves might tour the UK this year.
I have red and white mei and zen.
Hoping to get something nice this week though.
I shaved last night apparantly I look 12 years old now.
MoonWolf I'll swap something for your zen skin.
If only we could.
I've only got lots of sprays and the Tracer intro nothing else from the special event.
I can never again shave I will not go back to the days when I am getting hit on by drunken old men even after seeing my face.
Glenn has a trauma.
Not so much a trauma as a good excuse to have my horrid linux beard.
Linux beard 5/5.
I saw lots of those last weekend in Brussels at one of the biggest open source events.
Unfortunately my linux beard is on backwards.
I am now just imagining a quasi afro that grows downward from the back of your head.
...ok my fallout build turned into some kind of bullshit at some point. There I was scouting a hospital when I get spotted by a super mutant.
A whole lot of ammo and 3 legendary supermutant enforcer later in that one room...
What is your build ?
Hey if they refuse to fix their AI why would I change.
Sneak archer with a whole lot of vats shots it turns out.
Any crit banking ?
Side note the real purpose of crits in this game isn't the extra damage its the guarenteed vats hit.
Yeah thats what I am using it for mostly'.
Since sneak + crit from miles away seems like a good idea.
A shame that sniper rifle don't have extended vats targeting.
So you can't vats from miles away.
So full vats I can get off 17 shots on this pistol it seems.
Why do stimpacks make you thirsty in survival difficulty!?
Drugs make you thirsrty.
Stimpacks stimulate blood production and you need more water to stay hydrated.
It's the obvious conclusion.
Also hi I'm in Korea now.
Fun fact Korean mains sockets use the mainland European two round rods design.
The sensible design.
V glad I bought a multiplug instead of specifically a US converter for use in Japan.
Well you needed one to recharge at schiphol anyway right ?
I took advantage of having it to charge at Schiphol.
But I didn't actually plan on needing to charge there.
Because I have a battery pack.
But y'know that doesn't quite hold 2 weeks' charge.
Also the 3DS doesn't charge from USB.
Though I may try to find a 3rd party cable for such now I think on it.
Well that shouldn't be too hard in n-korea.
S korea searly.
Can confirm I am in Seoul not... Pyongyang?
Second best korea.
Or second worst.
Gwent unlike hearthstone does get fast nerfs.
Yesterday they patched the game and made my favourite deck type good again.
Today they nerfed it into the ground they made all the cards involved worse and didn't undo the few negative chagnes they made during buffing.
Apparantly i'm not allowed to play queensguard decks.
All the devs with a passing interest in balance work in the Heroes team.
Put out a new hero on tuesday give it the nerfbat by friday.
You need the OP period to drive sales.
Got rank 18 by win streak by playing a lowest curve play class cards deck.
Opponent was playing a beginner mage deck so I feel slightly guilty.
Oh boy this gon be good.
My team is me as mercy 3 pharahs and 2 zaryas.
Novice Network is normally good but can turn into trade chat it seems.
GlennCuttlefish MoonWolf.
Shots fired.
GlennCuttlefish MoonWolf <- reading is difficult.
!note Noelor.
Stupid gorillas with their superior strength.
*chest thumping noises*.
They weigh like 100kg but can just casually hang from 1 arm for extended periods bend steel bars etc.
Yeah because they have a completly different build from human.
This is like complaining a quadraped is better at running than you are or fish better than swiming.
Yeah the creature optimized for physical strength and tree habitation is better at it than you are.
Humans outrun most animals.
On endurance not on speed.
Gorillas are faster than people too though p.
I can't say this upsets me.
>Winston's melee does the same damage as Tracer's.
Everyones melee does the same damage.
Except for melee weapon melee.
Which is just a gun really.
Hammers are guns.
If I die I wanna come back as a gorilla.
You can enjoy living out in the quickly shrinking forest in the cold and the rain during rainy season and eat nuts and berries all day.
It'll be great.
Nuts berries are great.
Mm nuts and berries.
Free pizza lunch today o/.
Anathema what's the occasion?
Some Americans are here for some reason Pete is doing a long presentation.
Recycling people I think?
Ask them about Trump and watch them squirm.
My brother was in Florida just recently and he said people we so apologetic.
Anathema ask them in a thick accent and watch them squirm.
For multiple reasons.
Geneva people produced a fancy video with background music and everything to highlight things added in Fintrade Sprint 5 o_0.
This music is dreadful.
Anathema a bit like Fintrade?
This UI is awful.
Labels and values aren't aligned all over the place.
Not even programmer ui.
Just terrible ui.
It's specifically an internal-only video so I don't understand who the audience are.
'we made this stuff to feel better about ourselves'.
The two geneva guys that got put on our team are just awful.
No surprises there.
Cowboy coders in a team whopee.
'I don't read the spec I just do!'.
I ate a lot of pizza.
The acting CEO sent an email multiple lines end in !!!
One is even l!!!
Korea is weird.
Weird how ?
A lot of little ways.
I mean it's as different as Japan in the big ways.
But slightly different to that.
Like they have similar convenience stores that are much better than corner shops in the UK.
Except I went into one tonight and they literally had some potatoes baking on a bed of coals.
Just inside the door.
And two old guys just hanging out in there drinking.
Just you know open fire roasting some potatoes in a store.
As you do.
Also I ordered a cheese sandwich from the menu at a cafe at lunchtime.
And received a croissant.
With cheese ?
In the middle as well.
Well thats a sandwhich.
It was technically a sandwich yes.
They definitely had sandwiches made with bread I saw them in the cabinet.
Must have just been the chicken ones.
Oh also the croissandwich had hidden mustard but that's just me not being able to read the full ingredient list.
Unrelated my Facebook feed for the last day has been dominated by comparing about excessively heteronormative hairdressers.
... are people complaining their haidresssers are not CAMP enough ?
Is thats whats going on ?
Oh no that is.
Someone called them... let me go copy it.
Harbingers of the heteronorm.
Oh right it's the middle of the work day over there.
What are you up to in korea besides cheese criossants ?
So I'm making a Finnish race car driver for a Shadowrun 5 campaign and I'm not sure if I should go for maximum dickishness with his name.
Mostly so I can giggle whenever someone actually tries saying it.
MoonWolf not much tbh.
I went to a palace today.
Need to come up with a decent runner name too.
Which I cannot spell or pronounce.
And a museum with a neat cock exhibit.
Well okay then.
In fact let me go grab a picture.
I thought the cock museum was in sweden.
Iceland even I think.
Look at this Jojo-ass motherclucker.
He's pretty jojo.
Cooked_Auto that study was apparently done at my local uni.
So results may be dubious =P.
Its a sociology research paper.
Results are dubious by default.
But assuming they took their judges from the local populace.
Not sure I'd trust the standard.
The Metroid Prime thread has just officially derailed into PYD Post Your Dog.
Are they good dogs ?
By officially I mean OP-endorsed.
Judge for yourself friend.
The palace I was at today had some good dogs.
Those dogs are good dogs.
Is it a dog ?
I think it's a dog.
The second one is good.
And a dog.
The first one i'm just not sure.
Apparently they were very into the zodiac in Korea when they built this palace.
So they had all 12 around the main throne room.
They're all pretty worn though.
But that was the doggiest by my judgement.
Lot of wind chill when I was out today.
Like Sapporo I was wearing thermals and wishing I had thicker socks.
Here I just definitely appreciated my hat.
I wish I knew what made this phone just get bored of being on irc sometimes.
Being alt tabbed ?
Phones will kill background tasks if they feel like it.
Usually memory related.
Yeah memory makes sense.
I used to think it was time but ¯\_ツ_/¯.
They are loosely corrolated.
The longer the more time your phone has to eat memory with stuff.
Anyway switching it off on purpose to go to bed.
MoonWolf PoE 3.0 reveal.
MoonWolf seeing someone win with shadow rager.
MairBear pretty sure thats illegal.
Report them to blizzard.
Also yay 50.
50 what ?
Time to spend twice that much time just doing the level 50 quests.
You and glenn seem to hate all the dps classes between you.
I like lancer and summoner!
And glenn only likes black mage.
So thats cheating.
Glenn only -actively- hates machinist.
Thats becaue they are just slightly different bards.
Really hoping red mage isn't just a slighty different already existing class.
Its pretty blatant with machinist though.
And emoknight isn't a knockoff.
And while astrologion is a select which other healer to be its a lot more intersting and has its own mechanics.
I mean the turret and the reload buffs are different and the rotation is a whole other matter.
But yeah they just go bang a lot instead of twang.
Provide the same raid buffs have the same turn your instant shots into timed shots mechanics have the same utility tools.
Have a self buff provided by a shot that has to be maintained.
I think bard is actually better at AoE too.
What? I like monk as well.
Havent tried ninja but it seems fun enough.
I mean if you fuck up your hand jives you can't buff your damage for the next 20 seconds.
But when you press the buttons correctly it's alright!
Less dancing than monk.
Monk just press all the buttons all of them.
Are some of your buttons not on cooldown press those buttons.
But be standing in the right place when you press the button!
Even for your starter button!
I thought standing in the right place for your button was a dragoon thing.
Never stop dancing behind and beside the target! Never! What you're out of combat? Better spam that other button that charges up a move! Go go!
So dragoon you have a 4 hit combo at 60.
The 4th hit is positional.
Either side OR behind at random. That's it.
Monk you have the three hit combo rotations. Six different buttons if you ignore the aoe ones.
Some of them apply a buff so you only do them every 3rd or 4th rotation. Right?
Except every ability of those 6 has a positional bonus.
And when you have all the buffs the first and second are behind the third is from the sides.
But each of the buff/debuffs is the opposite. So when a single buff drops off. You have to swap up one of the behind/side skills. And so on! It's fun as heck but it does tire out the fingers to optimise dps xD.
Dps isn't supposed to be that complicated.
If i want complicated i'll heal.
But that's why monk is fun unlike other dps.
Is overwatch down?
I don't think so.
Oh it just claimed to be ready when it needed to update.
I'm not sure if it's because they're playing freeze mage but the ESL trinity series casters just pulled out an abacus XD.
Maybe freeze mage is just really boring and you might as well play with an abacus.
Gives yo usomething to do.
Cooked_Auto I am not sure I would fully trust that video.
Ok so obviously this is just some internal meme I'm not party to which whatever.
But I am super curious as to why some of the reactions are _.
Also I'm happy Pandora gave Rhoda a spellbook.
But don't think it answers the in-character question at hand.
Yeah because we needed more of this side comic bullshit.
This is cute though.
Ok.
Wtf am i looking at.
Someone's SA avatar.
Btw am I correct in remembering that you like Myst?
There was a full VLP of RealMyst on the casual thread if you're interested?
Nah seen l ike 3 myst 1 lps already.
Fucking kobayashi is a python developer i can no longer enjoy this anime.
Its ruined now.
MoonWolf this AST's rez macro..
I cast Reborn the Monster to ressurect Aelala Aela's original voice!
Fuck yugioh nerds.
YGO abridged nerd too.
Plus ast so it's fitting.
Bet you would have approved if it was resurrect.
So... yesterday? Day before? I said Seoul was weird in a different way to Tokyo but not in a way I could easily define.
I worked it out.
Staying in both cities is like visiting a science fiction setting.
But Tokyo is something like Mass Effect or Star Trek.
And Seoul is more like Blade Runner.
I'm not sure whta that really means.
Anathema i know right.
Guess I gotta play 3.0.
MoonWolf I mean mainly it means it's more miserable?
Well at least its not about to be invaded by spacesquid ?
Though I have a feeling a handful of the things that make it feel a bit dystopic are in fact due to their northern neighbours.
E.g. the cabinets full of gas masks in every subway station.
Yeah that would make it feel a biit dystopian.
This is great.
Neoreaction is an ideology obsessed with both the mechanics of power and autocratic governance and with aesthetics. Some neoreactionaries have a Tumblr devoted to their aesthetic vision called Post-Anathema I might need a new handle.
The world is an unfair place.
People like Steve Bannon get to have hair but I don't.
Anathema well would you want hair like bannons ?
Like in what way?
It looks shit.
Is what i'm saying.
He's got shit hair.
Well Final Uncharted 4 update out. It is indeed 1h 23 minutes long.
Following some chat about audio problems Figured it out. Audacity was using my webcam instead of my headset.
A good program.
A free program.
Audacity of Nope.
Hooray for a gadget legendary pity timer getting reset by fucking Finja.
Cooked_Auto this epilogue of uncharted 4 has serious lack of aunt chloe.
Which is a problem.
She was busy.
Too busy for pictures.
They got missplaced.
I mean Im sure they're around somewhere.
Ah the airport.
With its free WiFi and somewhat overpriced everything else.
As all airports do.
MoonWolf commentary on today's EGS I'm pretty sure even people who don't read the comic somehow knew that Tedd was a girl in the previous comic.
Man this overpriced airport coffee isn't even any good.
I just left about 1/3rd of it am now in security queue.
Being as annoyed as ever at the number of people still wearing all their coats bags still on backs etc.
Basically choosing to make their life less efficient.
The NCL security pisses me off.
I've not been through it when it's been busy.
Their policy of take anything that remotely involves voltage out separately.
That's p universal afaict?
Yeah plenty others are like laptop and tablets and whatever was in your pocket.
Taking if which reaching front of queue.
Because for some reason there's another several minutes of queue between the boarding pass check and scanners.
So comfy to listen to. 3.
Was GH the one with the horns?
That whole channel is great because its nothing but ambient tracks.
Just genuinely heard someone with a decidedly upper-middle class accent say cattle class.
As opposed to economy.
But like a previous time wanted all my bagged devices and chargers out eg phone and 3ds fun times repacking.
To follow from before.
Meh pack more efficiently tbh.
Ok I think I'm actually at the machines this time.
And thus I am scanned.
Person in front of me had something suspicious in their bag =O.
Famous last words v.
I had a great time at Vegas domestic security.
They did select screening on a central area that roughly went male teenage or older non-american passport.
While the queues of non-terrorists filtered around with us in plain sight.
Well at least you didnt have a middle eastern name.
MoonWolf the FF reddit has a weekly friday vent thread. Where you just blast whatever petty issues you've had in the week in all caps.
Is it full of FUCK PUBBIES ?
There's one person who has named himself the Salty Scholar and his raiding stories man.
Hah it's rarely about the pubbies.
Though there was one long story from that guy of an alliance in a raid that was full of people who were assholes lazy and at some points actively trying to wipe the run.
But seen no rage directed at new people/honest mistake makers yet xD.
But it has alerted me to one tragedy.
There are apps that parse your DPS that people break out in raids. I think they're not exactly allowed under the ToS so I don't really want to look too in depth.
But suffice to say there -are- ways people can determine their DPS and compare it to others C.
Still not something that gets linked so it sounds like it's only something progression and top tier raiding groups run into..?
Also Halo now has a CCG/RTS hybrid spin off?
Or this twitch ad is more confusing than most others.
Its on its second game even.
Gathering up recruits for Alphinaud's company is painful now that I know the plot in advance v.
I imagine it would be.
Especially given that a -begger- in Ul'dah refuses based on rumours about where the coin in coming from and so on.
A beggar has more awareness than the main cast.
Standard JRPG faire.
MoonWolf dear god I thought the PlayHearthstone stream had webcams.
By which I mean lifecoach staring into my soul rn.
But it's just a static picture.
Is it static.
Or is he just staring REALLY SLOWLY.
Awwh it swapped back to the other match where the players don't even have pictures C.
Just shaman face.
One of the problems with fallout 4 story is that I really could not care less about this mcguffin.
NV had best motive.
GlennCuttlefish but your baby.
That might very well have been stolen 200 years ago and is nwo dead and gone and so are your babies children and grandchildren.
This problem is never actually adressed by any character.
Yes but then all Fallout games past 3 has had this odd notion that only a couple of decades has gone past Armageddon.
Okay institute I might agree with you.
If you weren't psychopathic sciencenazis.
Ah but consider this.
They have a teleporter.
Teleporting is cool.
But GlennCuttlefish if they were agreeable.
Players would demand more freedom of choice!
I don't actually know but I'm assuming you can't join them?
Afaik the best choice.
Or that's what I've heard at least.
Bloody hell tumblr.
Started messing with the supply lines and such in this game.
The UI is not good for this.
Like I have no way of seeing who I have supply lines with.
Or no way of cancelling them most of the time in the game.
...huh. I was wrong there is a button to show them. now if only I could get a hold of those guys.
The game stream is green tinged now MoonWolf.
I wish it was a meta joke about the prevalence of jade decks.
This tournmanet stream is high quality.
But I given everything else... I think it's just production value.
Did you see the moment where they were streaming one game.
Commentating a third.
And playing the sounds from a second sorry botched order there.
Not wathcing it today at all.
Or just further around the Globelor? o.
Actually back in my flat.
Which at least one parent has been overzealous in tidying while I was away.
Oh dear... if my brother was allowed to tidy my place...
So I'm not the happiest Noelor 22-hour day probs not helping.
I'd be lacking at least 60% of my stuff. And have gained an pile of ashes.
Your parents come to your house and clean it for you ?
Nearly every book I own is in a different room to where I left it.
A pile of stuff I had set aside to do an actual clearing-out exercise on has distributed itself onto shelves.
Including y'know the stuff I'd have binned.
How're all y'all?
Same as always.
How was korea?
I didnt really like Korea tbh.
Full of maybe dogs.
And samsungs and hyundais.
Oh wow this epilogue is like half the video.
It is pretty excessive.
Like its cute.
But it feels a bit like writer masturabtion.
Cute but excessive.
I blame JK Rowling.
Jk rowling did it.
And clearly Naughty Dog just did it because she made it cool.
Rowlings epilogue was like what.
A few thousand words tops ?
3 pages or so yeah.
Not 20 minutes of reading.
So I thought my graphics card was shutting down and breaking apart.
MairBear oh dear?
TUrns out NVidia just decided to turn 3d support on.
Which apparently sometimes causes the typical seperation of colours other times just a red shift of the screen?
I wuoldn't know nvidia hasn't tried to turn 3d on for me.
Which video games ?
MoonWolf Yogg'saron just saved a game.
People still play that card ?
MairBear production quality still isn't great for HCT europe.
I did not listen to the interview.
Because fuck interviews.
The guy was silent and gave no indication of hearing questions. But camera fullscreened on him.
Awkward silence. Cut back. Okay next game.
This tournament is dropping some production balls.
C- on juggeling.
FF Stormblood collectors edition price �179.
From the promo pictures attached red mage looks hype.
Seems they wield rapier in one hand focus in the other and clip the focus to the hilt to use it as a rapier-staff for spells?
Does the CE come with a red mage hat?
It does not C.
Whoever that mysterious fellow is a cloth map and usual stuff otherwise.
Zenos yae Galvus.
As of this patch I still have never even met the name let alone the figure but let's be real he's on the cover and that's an Empire name.
Certainly a FF character.

Hype for RM though.
Noelor always been the raddest kind of mag.
All I know about Myst is that Jonathan Blow's The Witness is a clone of it... where are the line puzzles?
Instead of line p uzzles there are math and logic puzzles!
Myst has a day/night cycle What does it do? Makes it harder to see.
Noelor very realistic.
Well back from arguing for 5 hours about the morality of reviving sentient mushrooms.
Aka playing DD.
But hey after a year of IRL game time we finally reached the second level of the dungeon.
And now its time to get angry at videogames all night I want at least 2-3 levels before the event ends.
Mair red mage better get a duster weapon.
I need that for my maid set.
GlennCuttlefish so far they only get a chicken sword.
I should probably try to get mad at videogames too.
Not had any legendary from event.
I still only got 2 of the same mei skins so far.
Only legendary I got was zen.
Didn't farm enough credits to get to legend so just splurged on other epic/rares.
Wish I had a a zen.
Then I could get diva or hog.
Not a fan of that hog skin personally.
Stop featuring my worst moments in enemy POTG.
ChairmanLmao - player names.
I like it.
Sanzang Zenyatta and Bajie Hog in one box.
Just fuck you mair.
I give up.
Nothing but blues or duplicates.
Did you end up with zombie mushrooms or not?
We met one.
And then argued about making a new habitat for said mushrooms.
After we destroyed the old one.
I was just reminded that Clark Kent's ex was called Lana Lang.
Hey thats a perfectly legit name.
Also clark just has a thing for girls with l's in their name and for letters.
Like being called Lana Lang is a very comic books name but yes actually valid.
Both of Clark's major love interests being called L*** Lan* is suuuper comic books.
I blame the silver age.
Yeah that's generally what people mean when they say comic books as an adjective anyway tbh.
Ok continuing my gripes about this caravan system.
Even if I do get the NPC's to spawn in the sameish area I am in they are always ALWAYS outside the crafting zone.
Which means I have 5 seconds to get to them and run back inside the damned zone again.
I mean something is wrong when the easiest way to fix this situation.
Is by killing my settlers.
In the post apocalypse when you get fired from your job your boss kills you.
Glenn Then get the last FO4 DLC since the end game for that is that you become a raider and raid your own settlements.
Its really dumb.
You mean the only good piece of FO4 content bethesda made.
That can't be true because the build your own robot dlc is pretty good too.
But is ~fallout~ enough.
125620 › anathema you mean the only good piece of FO4 content bethesda made - sure but in the context of everything before that its pretty dumb.
Can I still buy seasonal overwatches tonight or has it ended?
Anathema I believe it's going until end of today.
The fall damage in this game is a bit inconsistent.
You either take no damage or die in my experience.
I dont know I want to side with the institute but the more I spend time down here the more I think these people are either outright evil or worse horribly incompetent.
Thats pretty much all of the factions.
MoonWolf btw I'm planning on being in Amsterdam for a weekend in the middle of march.
What are you going to be up to then ?
So the red light district and a coffee shops then? P.
Anathema I can't join because I'm busy -.
March is a stupid month because it's so busy.
But I'm planning a trip to UK in April.
Ftrbzzs that's a shame you're going to miss Emily she'll be in the himalays april may.
Dw though she said we should go to Finland sometime yesterday.
I will mention that tomorrow night if you are serious but that is end of June right? that might be a little too soon after she is back.
We can have our own midsummer party.
I'm thinking of taking July off.
Just to relax?
Anathema yeah I was working last July to fill in the Nordics region when everyone else was on holiday so this time I want to be off.
Ah that seems fair.
So hyped for PoE 3.0.
We don't even know what it is.
Its just going to be here is another act also we kept all the bad things.
It is announced tomorrow.
Its going to be disapointing.
Also that icon 3.
Damn these expectations for me. c.
I can never live up to them. Especially not the round gem presumably glued to the sternum...
You'll never have the ideal male body.
MoonWolf Umi is very not ok with that caev.
Its a bit aweird considering the amount of weird caves they've been in up to this point.
These charge attacks are p good.
Playing a bit of the 'happy camper headshots nazis 2' having had it in my steam library literally forever as a freebie.
It is remarkably fun until the nazis all spot you and it becomes like any other fps.
There. finished fallout4 playthrough.
Its a pretty good game with some flaws. Still one of the worse fallout games.
Fallout games are usually good.
Not that Bethesda has had a decent track record with them.
Feels really fucking good to win against a... kinda beast? druid who fused out nearly every single turn.
Okay this anime seems to be handling a character getting stabbed with a butchers knife in the abdomen really easily.
Bleeding out on the street but in the space of an evening gets patched up in ae and sent home for the night.
Well thats the first time my phone randomly going unresponsive almost screwed me over v.
Fucking hell. Tweetdeck has started infuriating me with its shitty scrolling.
I thought tweetdeck was gone.
No they only got rid of their desktop app the website still works.
'more stacked than high school girls have a right to be' is a really weird sentence my dude thanks the internet.
Fuck you the internet.
You are beeing creepy.
One of said characters.
What game even is this ?
Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE.
It is *intensely* anime.
Being a Persona/Fire Emblem... crossover?
Ah that thing.
Multiple layers of anime.
A good mod.
Anathema HAPPY FRIEND'S DAY.
Anathema MY FRIEND?!
Anathema that's what valentine's is in Finlandia -.
Happy friends day then.
Is that what I retweeted?
Anathema nah you retweeted a cat picture with the message 'wishing you a valuable and joyful valentines including those who don't celebrate it due to over-commercialisation misantrophy or Rasputin.'.
So I spent last night trying to install drivers for gtx 970.
Apparently I was working with a screaming and kicking baby and the drivers were a damn mission.
Ooh fancy new gpu?
Well old new.
I got it cheap second hand it still doubles my memory.
Oh I don't know gpu numbers anymore.
Still not exactly a bad gpu.
Anathema we're in the 1000 range for nvida now.
Yeah 1070 is recent I think.
1060 and 1080 were the high and lowend entries at the start of this generation.
Recently they brought the 1070 and 1080ti.
But 1070 was 400-500€ and this 970 wasless than 150.
They should use more numbers.
I kicked up Overwatch and it was pretty.
Then I tried to kick up for honour beta but the beta was ove r-.
I don't get that game.
For honour was where I got told my gpu didn't match minimum requirements.
MoonWolf I got to play a bit with my laggy gpu and it was a bit weird.
But I get the gist of it.
Although I thought it would've been bigger maps not 1v1 2v2 4v4 etc.
They made that game 5 years ago it was call chivalry and nobody liked it.
Ah classic rebranding.
But now that it has less options less modes and less players per map.
Its suddenly hot shit ?
MoonWolf just well branded.
11h 52 minutes to PoE announcement.
But I looked at what people said about it and it wasn't too positive so..
MoonWolf chivalry had npcs?
Anathema it had bots ?
I thought chivarly was more like war of the roses 16v16 teams no bots / npcs.
Granted it did not have guys with katanas or naginatas.
It's a shame war of the roses became both inundated with cheats and pay-to-win.
It did not have MOBA style creep minions no.
For honour has bots too.
For honour looked like most of the fighting was minion bots with like 4v4 players.
Like i said a worse chivalry.
!note Noelor oh god umi really did just break.
TIL I only have this in one wrist.
Do you have it in both?
Anathema I do.
Ftrbzzs so fintrade lost the source code for one of the versions deployed at a customer...
Anathema sorry what?
A customer has a build of fintrade that they don't have the source for because they do unique builds for each customer but have no way to keep track of what is in each one and in fact don't even know if the build / DB scripts will work until they try to produce one.
MoonWolf what keyboard layout do you use again?
Trying to help a French colleague set up his keyboard.
That's what I thought.
How do you accent on that?
Type the accentng character than the character you wante accented.
É is ' and then e.
Ë is and then e.
Is and then space.
' and c.
Nm found it.
Its a fairly intuitive system.
With some exceptions.
Like ß being alt s.
I get that sorta.
Supposed to just going for a short run today but I wanna do some weights too since I couldn't do my full routine last night because >monday evening gym rush.
Anathema damn 'em mondays.
MoonWolf I have shown French colleague how to US international and he is quite happy with it.
Victory over the forces of bad typing.
Not least because it turns out his name has a ï in it.
Oh that would be a pain to type on a uk layout.
Impossible I think.
You'd just have to alt-code it.
I don't really consider that typing?
This always reminds me how my UK company HR could not possibly spell my name correctly because they didn't have 'ä' on their keyboard.
That might just be me being weird.
Ftrbzzs had I been them I'd've had it written somewhere I could copy/paste it from.
But I don't work in hr so...
Also our HR don't do their jobs properly.
Couple weeks ago I took a day of ill got an email while ill telling to fill in a form the form is a badly formatted word document.
I have filled it in but HR wasn't in that day so I didn't know what to do with it so I still have it.
Email it ?
The form is meant to be printed and written in I think.
Make a photo email that.
Fields / spaces to put answers were created by long strings of ____________________.
Chris Evans is a true hero _.
Goal body and goal personality combined <3.
Noelor it was in my email signature where I asked them to correct my name.
But I guess that was too hard -.
They don't teach how to copy paste it's tough.
Well finally seriously started bloodborne.
And by seriously I mean played long enough to run into a boss.
Which then killed you.
Wait you didn't have access to change your own email signature???
MoonWolf Once again Sectopods strike with impunity.
His mistake is letting them do stuff.
What no? one shot cleric beast.
Also they lost control of the package.
Did I mention they lost control of the package?
Only about 15 times.
But now I am faced with my biggest enemy in these games Build decisions.
I dont want to get locked out of anything but I fear I will not do any damage if I spread my points around too much.
Cant remember what the LP I watched suggested since it pretty much covered everything.
Ftrbzzs were you saying earlier that Valentines is Friends Day in Finland.
Directly translated yes.
Is that your third Nick now.
Blame someone you don't know.
Don't get me wrong.
I am on board with it.
Anathema apparantly 3.0 isn't a new act.
Its 6 new acts.
Really hoping its not 6 paper thin new acts with tons of reused assets.
MoonWolf A+ presentation from that Playhearthstone event featured on Trolden.
In another episode of Blizz should just release a Lucio album.
MairBear> it's good to see those ben brode headshots he released a couple months ago getting their intended use.
Yay a reinhardt potg D.
Just had red team mystery into triple tank. ended up spending 4 mins as mccree just spamming M1 on shields and getting fucking nowhere.
<- original was better imo.
Also ben brode headshots?
Had an attack symmetra on my team who just would not use m1.
Theres a genji right in our face nope instead just runs away even with me healing them.
First time I have ever singled out anyone in my calling out of bad playing.
But m1 is so good.
And easy to use.
Not according to this asshole.
Silver eliminations. Silver damage done. Sombra.
How hard is it to play symmetra.
Join a backfill team second round my team captures the point and.
Lets the enemy capture it.
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH MY TEAMS TONIGHT.
Anubis point B red team conveniently randoms intro triple tank.
Really fun having 'tank shredder' mccree when there's rein barrier stacking.
5 games 0 wins so far.
Hanamura B. Red get quad turret comp.
This is not the day for overwatch.
All three of us playing seperate all 3 of us having typical blue teams.
No day is the day for overwatch.
Well I thought loot boxes were being dicks to me.
Since a legendary I got earlier in the event boxes was just from the classic set.
But now it goes and drops the event mei skin.
After nearly 2 hours of playing I have one victory.
Seems people just dont want to win today.
I mean in that last game. I had a reaper that did nothing but hide behind walls and follow me the mercy. Which I can't fault.
What I can fault. Is that is all he did.
And no one on my team EVER learned despite me pointing it out.
Point being I would just bring out my gun while running and still get him to 50 hp or so. So any assistance would have saved me every time.
Bah the students union at my alma mater are changing the name of the bar in the name of diversity.
Sure is esports to release a pink 'change strip' for v-day.
2 hours 40 minutes.
For 3 fucking wins.
Jesus christ these players.
Took so long I missed last chances for boxes.
Aw shucks.
Jesus went triple gold as 76 on mystery get potg and we lose 2-0.
Lol at that little speed stripe.
MoonWolf lol.
I'd be quite happy.
How will I pick a build though!?
Ftrbzzs PoE 3.0 Juneish has 6 new acts.
Anathema oooooooooooooooooooh no.
*counts hours in day*.
*counts amount of holidays left in year*.
I can take July off.
And it shall be the PoE holiday.
If I visit then are you going to be all go away I need to play PoE ? p.
Anathema bring your laptop?
It cannot run PoE.
Well that's just something you need to fix then.
Travel or Laptop that can handle PoE.
Anathema let's just hope it comes out in July and you visit in June -P.
I can't visit June Emily might not be back until mid-june and probably needs a couple of weeks to recover.
Midsummer in Finland will help her recover.
Or get liver disease.
One of the two.
It's like hitting the reset button on your body.
A really intense purge.
Purging the finnish way.
Sounds like something you should advertise as the new fad.
I will discuss dates with Emily tonight / this week.
Oh god where the hell do I find a drill small enough for 1x1mm magnets D.
Cooked_Auto you start with kalsarikänni shitfaced in your underwear and develop into kaatokänni falling down shitfaced.
Then there's the coma stage and you are revived.
Considering I am going to play a Finn in a Shadowrun Vladivostok game I should remember stuffl ike that.
Cooked_Auto you need a Finnish 101.
Anathema has some experience mainly about sauna and running around naked.
It's okay I can ask Glenn or you or the other finns I know on Discord and game with.
I typed senpai into google to get a definition.
Ftrbzzs and weird liqoruice alcohol.
Anathema am nam nam.
It autocompleted with noticed me.
Hell. Ive asked some of my russian friends for what nickname he should have.
Ftrbzzs see also Japanese onsen.
I am going to have to look up a wide range of finnish cursing just because.
Which albeit I've not been to Finland but to my understanding basically similar onsen are just wetter.
And less whippy.
The whippyness makes them finish.
Damn unintended puns.
Cooked_Auto I can give you a Finnish cursing 101 on mumble at some point.
Just listen to ftrbzzs playing Overwatch.
I don't need a course on finnish cursing.
You never know when it could be useful.
Surrounded by drunk Finnish people who can't make up whether to beat you up or not? cures in Finnish make friend and slip away.
A finnish healer angrily cures in finnish.
I'll just curse in dutch and see where that takes me.
>making friends with Finnish people by talking to them.
Its perfectly possible. if they're drunk.
Unlike what you might have learned from anime.
You don't have to punch or shoot people to befriend them.
I've seen that happen as well.
I literally had breakfast 2 hours ago why am I hungry again!? I added extra pumpkin seeds specifically to stop this!?
Anathema eat more.
Noelor in my porridge.
Anathema or move less like me.
Anathema so I got a new gfx card by chance when I mentioned on Twitter that I need an upgrade then the person who gave me his old one offered me to join their company's lan party this summer.
He is head of design in one of the biggest hipster software companies here -P.
So I'm totally going.
Anathema maybe put more actual porridge in it.
...As in bacon bits in the porridge?
Or just.... also eat some bacon.
Anathema Simon said yes to UK in April so we'll let you know dates.
Ftrbzzs you could do late May and be here for the beer festival p.
Anathema I can't because of business quarter end.
I can't ask for holiday for quarter end months.
Like this month is fiscal year end.
You got an idea of dates in April?
After easter possibly.
That's the week of the 17th.
Possibly 18th to 22nd.
Why is your business offset by two months?
Wait no that's just one isn't it.
Noelor because they decided their fiscal starts in March.
Oh is it actually offset by two.
Just how it is.
Offsetting makes sense because you get to do YE when people are actually around.
But you only really need to offset by one so you're doing it in late Jan / early Feb.
Indeed don't know the background why it's March.
But that's how we roll.
I blame the US hq.
Maybe due when tax year is over there.
Might be to line up with that.
Fiscal years are weird yo.
My employers run a Jan-Dec financial year and tbh I wish we didn't.
Makes January even more stressful.
MithrilCo ran Feb-Jan I think.
Someone has a cat snoring on their desk in this skype call 3.
Tell them to pet their catte.
Somehow pronounce it that way.
My English textbook has a sidebar on the difference between typeface and font.
Omg one of the authors used linux.
Even after all this time people still consider using linux outrageous?
Had I viewed a plain-text website on my own laptop which runs on Xubuntu Linux the text would have appeared in... DejaVu Sans Mono.
Most readers of English are better accustomed to typefaces in which a capital 'M' will take up rather more space than a comma than they are to monospaced typefaces.
Boring people is more like it =I.
GlennCuttlefish not outrageous.
But still unusual.
Also definitely the first time I've seen it come up in a textbook that is not itself about computing.
MoonWolf did you see the stuff about Legacy Leagues?
Gonna play that.
Omg will need to pick some good leagues.
I hope they are going to use that as the way to access old league in the future tooo.
Legacy league launches areound the same time as the new Mass Effect though.
Anathema love that image.
Yeah I want it as a wallpaper.
Assuming you just mean the background to that I agree.
What is it?
Art from PoE expansion.
Just general promo art or ???
Well it's probably actual lore characters in it but I dunno who yet.
Anathema its the background art for the god powers thing.
Its the gods at war.
Lunaris and solaris are fighting in th emiddle.
The guy on the far right is the final boss of act 6.
....wow I should not have googled that.
Turns out Nants ingonyama bagithi baba translates to there comes a lion.
Circle of Life.
It's ya lion.
When does the season end in d3 btw?
They normally run for 3 months so I guess towards end of March or start of April.
A while yet then.
If you need help i'll help.
Tbh it's more.
When it does finish I want to be sure to log in and collect all my shit in non-seasonal mode.
Because if you'll recall I logged into my crusader when we did the D1 stuff to find I only had the armour on her back.
Next season we'll finally have a crafting materials tab.
And a gear/spec switcher.
And primal ancients which are ancients with 30% better mainstat rolls!
Are you excited for all this new content.
I'm not.
They're good QOL upgrades that they implemented too late for people to care.
And a lazy tier of EVER BETTER GEAR.
I don't want ever better.
I want DIFFERENT.
Not even new orange gem effects.
The tooltip art outline is red now though!
When's Bone Lord.
Noelor oh i'm wrong.
They changed primal ancients.
They are not 30% better.
Instead they have maxed rolls.
Which is... i mean.
I guess thats at least not as power creepy.
Its still pretty lazy/boring through.
Still just numberserer.
But at least they are not mandotory you must get this in order to be able to compete.
And they won't meaningfully push the clearable rifts number higher.
Its still bad though.
Just not as bad ?
Email from Kickstarter asking to confirm my address.
For Ex3 =V.
Btw not even a feature that K$ had when that project was launched.
It's just as well though.
Given I still lived with my folks back then.
Not that I expect they'll move soon.
But before I next move probably.
Had a conversation about alphabet soup with a colleague this afternoon.
Who kept saying LGBGT.
And I could not work out how they ended up using that sequence of letters.
What did they think it stood for.
Misread the Q? got mixed up with the sandwich?
And now I started thinking about it and got confusing sandwich.
Lesbian guacamole bacon tomato and then my brain caught up.
My next subway order!
Please don't order a lesbian at subway.
You'll probably only get hurt.
Why do you think subway sells unsafe lesbians?
I think that BwaS in particular is not safe in proximity to lesbians.
Just in comparison to others here.
Especially if ordering one in a sandwich.
BwaS what's this about another Dark Materials m.
Also the elephants were bicycles btw.
!note noelor and it's been a long long time since I read them and I remembered them as one wheel.
BwaS they're bipedal but oriented front-back.
I re-read a couple years ago.
The series as a whole didn't really hold up diminishing quality over the three imo.
But how many wheels did they have.
Ah okay found a wiki on them.
What are we talking about ?
These fucked up wankers.
That is not neither a prequel or a sequel.
It is both.
It could be concurrent.
Lego Batman seen perfect.
MoonWolf the article says it covers events before and after.
Also I found a perfect facebook page.
This is my new anthem.
And this one is for MoonWolf.
What even are these.
The perfect Facebook page.
The dankest memes.
Anyway they're from.
Anyway I'm torrenting Revolutionary Girl Utena now.
Thats pretty gay.
This is what I've heard.
I also ought to finish up SMC honestly.
Such language.
Well there are children present.
And a fairy!
Fuck the fairy.
But there are children present.
Right that's the new heroes mount farmed out.
God I've got too many of these now...
No such thing.
You must hoard them.
Guard them from interlopers.
Like a hat-dragon.
MoonWolf did you keep watching Dragon Lore?
It is a gradual descent into insanity.
That first episode seemed pretty free fall.
I'm up to E11 and the commentary is 50% weird noises and giggling.
Also Fae informed the audience of in the context of Katy Perry's opus 'I Kissed a Girl'.
If only you were lp'ing a slightly less horrifying cgi game.
Like dogs with flaps.
Gimme mor eflaps.
She's LPing Okami with Liquidypoo?
Might watch that.
And streaming Recettear every monday hence earlier screenshot.
Yeah but weird youtuber streamers.
Do you want thread? a goon is actually showing up with Japanfacts after each episode.
I'll take a link to okami thread.
Oh I lied it's PWNovel.
I get some of the dudes in TFN confused.
Okami incidentally is a horrible pun name of a game title.
And i hate if ro that.
This has already been affirmed in thread.
They porbably think its really clever.
Good news MoonWolf.
Also Master Onigiri is a double edged pun in that it can be read as either rice ball o-nigiri or demon slash oni-giri.
I'm starting to become afraid to watch this lp.
Look it's a japanese game about japan and japanese folklore.
A certain level of pun is just to be expected.
I've ended up with control of the quote board again.
But I can't think of anything other than pizza rolls not gender roles.
Linus Torvalds believes the technology industry's celebration of innovation is smug self-congratulatory and self-serving. linus is a hero.
Anathema typical Finn.
'this is shit'.
'but it's making millions!'.
He's not wrong though.
Innovation is like digitalisation everyone talks about it and few only know about it.
But they make millions.
I mean innovation for innovations sake is a terrible idea.
Or rather how that is implemented every time.
The official scrabble dictionary has ar as in the letter 'r' as an acceptable word. what kind of bullshit is this?
No clue but i'm sure there is some giant as thread on a scrabble forum that can explain it to you.
Well I disagree.
I'm equally certain that the we disagree camp is well represented in this thread.
It also allows the names for the notes of the major scale.
Do re mi etc.
Oh just over a week less on PoE 2 I should back that.
Also finish PoE.
Why'd they use Fig instead of kickstarter?
Ok fine jeesh I give up.
Its time to brush my hair when my full size sennheisers get tangled in it.
Then again I dont feel like moving my arms today. maybe tomorrow.
GlennCuddlefish just put your hair on a bun solves so many problems.
My hair is too glorious to be trapped by such things.
Or would be if i ever actually took care of it.
Bleh. I hate mild flu's. not in enough of a coma to sleep but dont have the strength to actually do anything. like untangling this mess.
My solution is to put my hair on a braid keeps it out of the way most of the time.
And when it annoys me I show the scissors to it.
Your hair is not a person it is not afraid of scissors.
You may never know.
Spoken like a person with short hair.
It could be like Marvel's Medusa.

At least it's not orc or human again.
The last hero was also a night elf.
We still only have 3 Night Elves and only 1 high elf 1 blood.
Free 3200 dust.
I have a golden rag.
I love my golden rag.
Was my first golden legendary.

I'm not sure what shoebills have to be angry about.
I mean they're both a shoe and a bill.
I wouldn't be happy about that combination.
...why are they called that.
I assume because ornithologists are half blind or have really strange feet.
It derives its name from its massive shoe-shaped bill. Which I can kinda see why.
2 hours for my first win of today.
Oh hey seems berseria was finally cracked.

They just tile that shit too.
It is a thing of beauty.
Ftrbzzs MoonWolf.
Anathema where will I find the time for this all?!
I like sleep.
Sleep at work.
Its a short league.
So you won't need much time!
Is it? I assumed it would be the regular 3 months.
I'm assuming this is more for testing the leaguestone mechanic.
And they'll add that to standard or make it a global thing in future leagues.
Just with seriuosly reudced droprates on the stones.
MoonWolf I'm not so sure about that.
But i am.
I will bet you 1 ex p.
Or however many chaos that is worth on 3.0 release.

Good because i'm not farming you an ex.
I wouldn't want to hinder your start on a new league.
Why can't I have more hours in the day -.

...omfg they actually bought a copy of the corporate management book the CEO said I will buy everyone a copy to read.
They are signed by the executives....
And mandatory reading?
In the presentation the book was introduced in I think it was implied to be mandatory yes.
I'm not reading it.
Suddenly there's tests.
Okay probably not because penalizing you for anything related would probably be a breach of at least a couple of laws but who knows in the new lawless brexit england.
I'm in a good position of being the only full-time developer on the framework they mandated was the future of the company in the same meeting they mentioned the book on p.
Well then p.
Anathema what book?
Next you can tell them that you prefer the open organization by Jim Whitehurst -P.
Anathema well done they have expose the obvious mantra of people.
Hope it will be acted upon as well.
I don't want to read either of these books p.
Anathema Jim's book has more anecdotes and stories than management consulting approach.
Cooked_Auto 'he snored'.
I can relate to that.

Ha ha as if I had anything fancy like that.
I have....well I have nothing besides basic aspirin right now.

I'm ready for the jewel to cost multiple ex.
Like the jewels that make golems good.
A simple stable large enough for keeping and raising as many chocobos as you can imagine if 512 is the maximum number you can imagine. hee.
I'm having a hard time imagining more so yeah thats probably enough.
Anathema oh. good.
Well that dumb feature works.

That give you red eyes and evil black arms ?
Oh Moonwolf this should be easy.
It's the 18th and I'm still rank 22.
You've said this before about low rank matches.
Time to make some new player cry vs a jade druid.
Moonwolf craft Fandral at this time y/n.
Is he still standard? I forget when he arrived.
He's standard wotog.
So good until the 2018 rotation point.
Still won't for now though.
No more the i'm dying kind.
He's certainly more craft-worthy than anomalous.

People on reddit have talked about tactics of getting free dust.
Now I'm worried blizz will adjust their policy so I dare not do anything.
Well if somehow you don't have a rag or a sylvannas yet and have the dust to craft them you should.
IE craft them all gold get free dust disenchant the gold.
Because you'll get that dust back.
Hearthhead did the sums on that strat and you get a net zero.
Yeah its only profitable if you don't have the card yet.
Then its a free card.
However if you have them already its uhm good free dust.
And if you have sylv or rag golden you are in buisness.
Yeah. Will just leave my hall of fame cards alone.
<3 golden rag.
Aya's card art makes me forget how hilariously tiny she is.
Huh so it is.
My opponent mustr be so confused right now.

Horrific robot-on-robot violence.
I thought frodan's attire this week was relatively modest.
Then I saw the sidecam on him and his jacket lit up like fucking blackpool.
Gods now blizz are trying to upsell my least favourite card of the new set by saying you can play it in warrior!
Did they... change the class?
I'm watching the new SU.
Not really just someone at the HCT playoff stuck it in a warrior deck and the casters are gushing over the idea.
SU was pretty ='3.
Longest mage game ever BUT that was an amazing read.
Opponent has 13 hp and iceblock and is in fatigue.
Plays a flame imp that he got from kazakus. To bring him down to 10 so that his opponent can't Pyroblast him for the fatigue kill.
Still lost but eh.
Far more interesting than some trash pirate mirror between warrior and rogue.

MoonWolf I like this avatar combo.
Yeah he got that after completing the lp.
Oh is that the guy who did that.
Since Ribbons don't exist in FFVIII they are less accessible than nearly any other FF game. I mean yeah that would have that effect.

Mais bien sur mon ami.
Anyway that's not really fair though I appreciate the Camus allusion.
If you can read french you know which letters are and are not to be pronounced.
And... ugh explaining this is weird.
If you're listening to french silent letters affect the sounds around them in ways that make it if not obvious easy to work out what silent letters are there.
Like mais is definitely spelt that way not mait which may well be a different word.
In english otoh.
We actually get a lot of our silent letters *from french*.
Like people standardising spelling knew french so they spelt english words that way.
A handful come from dutch typesetters mostly g's I think? because iirc dutch g is very unlike french or english g.
But unlike french if you're reading or writing english it is nigh impossible to know which letters are silent and which silent letters to insert.
Without just... knowing the etymology of the entire english language I guess?
Our g is indeed distinct.
Test ~ bla~.
Spoilers for latest SU which uh two-three days ago I think?
Mario gives 0 fucks.
.....game dont do this to me.
There I was minding my own business progressing the story and the music starts.
The music I spent so much time listening to in previous games because fuck that boss.
It would be really crazy if Mario travelled to each area holding a Star Spirit defeated each guardian there rescued all seven of them and managed to use their powers to find a way to counter the effects of the Star Rod insane.
Well that was disappointing. only proves my theory that this game is much easier than the previous one.

Best i have is a weapon upgrade warrior that runs some pirates.
Aye but there's a reason I don't ladder control warrior much these days Dx.
Aachoo Bleshoo - player names.

More empty lines.
Ok so what I've learned here I think.
Thumbs up emoji.
Is don't use facebook to copy emoji.
Oh they are probably doing something funky like substituting images and making the alttext an nonbreaking space.
So you copy what looks like an emoji but really its an empty space.

Be ... a mermaid.
Pixelly tits everywhere?
Mermaid seems like a disadvantageous thing to be.
By my memory that game is fairly... land-based.
Yeah its a bit out of left field.
Apparantly your move animation is hopping around on your fish-tail.
Not a wheelchair?
100% of games featuring mermaids that I have Kickstarted have them sit on top of an external source of locomotion to move on land.
Be it wheelchair or giant crabthrone.
How many mermaid featuring games have you kickstarted.
Fellowship and Wizard School in which the mermaid is a total nerd.
MoonWolf important fact about lp.zone.
Updates for SSLPs can be collapsed into details tags.
Meaning they don't keep loading every picture every time you open the thread.
That is a good feature.
Also you don't need to load a page of an sslp thread and then wait a minute refresh the page.
And finally see the new post.
Also their spiders are blurred instead of black bars and don't appear on mouseover.

Noelor how many passenger yacht friends do you have ?
I have some friends who have probably been yacht passengers?
Totally sfw stuff.
Had a good laugh tho.
My other RPG group just ship various characters together or with NPCs.
Usually nws stuff p.
But has lead to a couple of injokes at least.
You say that like it never happened here.
True but in our case that usually leads to pictures being drawn or stories being written P.
The rule in the group is that if it's drawn or written it has happened.
Well that seems easily abused.
True but we're all comfortable with each other by now.
Noelor gotta live up to the Cynis family name.

Oh dear. I noticed I can powerlevel cooking in berseria. I also know you get an outfit for leveling it to level 10 on velvet.
This means my party has eaten 200 prickleboar sausages in the last few minutes.
That also means I've spammed my enter key literally a thousand times in the last few minutes.
One problem I have with the tales games lately is that the main characters just keep getting more broken.
Like I usually dont even bother with normal combat in this usually just going for linked encounters.
That might also be because I am not on hard mode this time merely moderate.
But even so I can just usually keep half the battlefield stunned or dead while regenerating health with the trigger moves.

I'm currently watching a very popular twitch chat because i need to see a cheer happen in real time for reasons.
And i've learned that koreans LOVE spamming ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ.
I have no clue what it means.
I've also learned the default timeout period for spamming on nightbot is 5 seconds.
Considering that thousands are spamming at the same time this does nothing.
No wonder witchchat is horrific.
MoonWolf it's a lone consonant but idk which because it's not one of the foundation ones.
Ok I checked and k.
Probs supposed to be kekekekeke or something?
In fact yeah hangul doesn't have an e vowel because Korean doesn't/didn't.
That makes some sense.
| is i _ is I · which isn't used in modern Korean is I think either a or aa.
_ is U fuck you autocorrect.
The only place in Korea I got a souvenir from was the national museum of hangul.
It is my favourite thing about Korea by a long long way.
It has a meseum ?
What do they have there just really old writing examples ?
That examples of poetry and signs and pottery with developing hangul on it.
Printing presses the products thereof.
You've read Hate and/or Hate+ right?
I have read hate and know mostly what happens in hate+.
But iirc the social role of hangul in a society where the alternative is Han Chinese characters is explored in that series.
Yes sort of.
The space reincarnation of it.
Mostly focussed on sexuality / marriage / feminism though.
Ok I guess it's more in Hate+ then.
Hate is a pretty O_o story in general.
Girl with life threatening genetic condition gets unfrozen out of cold storage to be used as a arranged bride in political move. decides FUCK EVERYONE dooms ship by uploading herself as an ai because she's dying.
Otoh make a cake for your waifu.
In hate+ you can give your waifu a harem.
The main girl hooks up with the ai program you're just secondary to the relationship.
Omfg really ffxiv.
I struggled with one of the Alexander themes which sounds like words. I looked up lyrics cos why not. No wonder I struggled. it's written in goddamn goblin speak.

MoonWolf does PatternSpider have a syntax for d66 rolls as in Meido.
I have no clue what a d66 roll as in meido is.
2D6 read in order.
As opposed to added.
Or an actual random number from 1-66.
There you go you rolled a 54.
Not sure how a 2d6 is supposed to produce results below 11 though.
That was what I was trying to express.
The tables in almost any Japanese trpg run from 11-66 with 36? entries.
Hey so uh.
Is whitespace entirely optional in html?
Any whitespace besides single spaces is utterly ignored.
A website can be a giant single link of text with just spaces between words / tags.
Noelor use for pre-formatted text.
MoonWolf sure can.
Is that meant to be blurry ?
Blurred because that's our database code but you can see how often lone breaks occur.
This is frequently what machine generated html lookslike.
Computer doens't need the code the be sanely spaced or indented.
Also you strip them to save precious bytes during transfer.
Unlike programmers who tend to want to be able to read their files when they edit them.
Anathema who the fuck strips whitespace ?
Luckily chrome will add line breaks back in.
MoonWolf probably google.
Thats because their whole site is just a giant script file.
Not much actual html in their served page.
Noelor May or may not be interesting to you.
Cooked_Auto you're actually the second person to link me that =D.
I hit the remind button.
You werent here when I linked it the first time =p.
Welcome to being civilized australia.
Took you long enough.
Berseria was getting too serious for a tales of game so I had to dress up as a maid and fly around on a pig.
Pretty traditional tales shenanigans.
I still cant tell if that is a really short skirt or just really weird overalls.
Apparently the Berserk game is out.
Also why is it that so often the best girl in a tales of game is a guy?
Why is he wearing some big metal collar thing that fits over his head ?
Is it a fashion statement ?
I mean how deep into spoiler territory do you want me to go here.
Personally i don't really care.
Its a mind control thing I assume. He had it on him when I stole him.
Dunno why it took forever into the game to give me a variant without that thing and by then I had gotten used to it.
Also the butler uniform in this is rubbish.
......well this is the best mount animation I have seen in a while.
Okay I'm curious at what they're hinting at here.
A+ comment.
Damn doomfist is younger than i thought.
Could be a number of things. either a new escort map or then a playable character Which I doubt unless its some kind of remote controlled robot.
Or her inside a robot body.
So to get all the titles to max rank I have to play for a minimum of...200 more hours.
Oh yeah this series has a habit of doing that. Completely forgot since this game has been so easy so far.
Whole party just died to...something? Whatever it was it hit the whole battlefield.

I have to stop and play cards.
Cardfight vanguard not even once.
Does anyone care about spoilers for the Berserk game?
Another child succesfully beaten in a silly card game.
Even if I technically cannot be called a hero in this game.
Does the berserk game have any plot points not covered by other material?
No idea the spoiler I saw was for the ending.
Great aint it.
I see I hit the inflation point of this game again.
3 towns ago my shopping costs were usually around 3-10k.
Last town around 60k.
This town 114k.

Signs you are about to watch a good LP Holy shit I thought you made that chapter card in MSpaint but no it's really like that.
Also not the same LP here's a Dragon Lore gif featuring its protagonist racing perfectly to its bullshit.
MoonWolf idk if you're still watching Vicas' Dark Souls LP.
But editing Vicas' snarky comments are pretty on point in today's.
1910 damn doomfist is younger than i thought <--- but are they still voiced by Terry Crews?
That would be funny.

Will need to discuss with all involved I'm hoping either Monday or Wednesday.
Anathema I can put aside Wednesday evenings only for you.
I'll create a doodle poll.
I'll play all nights free atm anathema.

Which is very annoying for someone like me to start with.
But also right now half the stories in it are wrestling-related???
I was mostly annoyed that they removed the obvious bookmarks button.
And has a tendency to stick pretty much any page you visit even once on the front.
I just view that as a recent pages thing tbh.
Noelor use Firefox.
Is the desktop version actually good nowadays?
Like without installing a gazillion extensions.
I meant on mobile.
I place a lot of value on the shared history bookmarks etc between desktop and mobile.
Which I assume Firefox has.
But last time I looked at it it was the Bethesda game of browsers.
THEN AGAIN if they still have backspace bound to Back that may be worth.
I dunno how chrome does it but you can get tabs and stuff from other browsers.
Plus on firefox mobile you can get adblock which you cannot get in chrome.
I might grab that for my tablet at some point then.
Weirdest bit of clickbait I think I've seen UK Funeral Directors Are Furious That People Know About This.
What are they furuios about though ?
The hell if I know.
Not clicking on that shit.
Did anathema get anywhere further with his DW plans this morning that DW maybe?
Not that i saw.
Noelor gonna be DW unless I turn out to hate it in play.
6 hp left opponent topdecks kabal courier and gets a fireball n.
Ahahahhahahah MoonWolf MoonWolf.
This paladin just pyrmancer equalitied.
When he was miles ahead on board.
Yeah thats a thing they do.
My strongest was a 4/3 he had a 6/6 5/3 and three 2/2s.
Did he not realize he played a pyromancer ?
And yeah he needlessly went face.
No cos he attacked face with all the things.
Played pyro played equality.
Played an 8/8 fordring too but I drew MC. had entomb for it though.
MoonWolf it's gonna be that time again deck 4 copies of random legendaries.
Well i'll get a free pack.
After 62 hours I can finally start searching for the 4 elementals.
Ok so that is what it looks like when my phone decides irc takes up too much memory.
What does it look like ?
2024* Kirisu has quit Client exited.
As opposed to.
2029* MoonWolf has quit Quit Blargh.
Yeah i'm working on something sorry.
Well it cant be written worse than ME3.
That URL is nothing short of *perfect*.
There better be some notable gamer-poop quotes too...
MoonWolf I'm watching an archive from a couple weeks ago of Fae streaming Stardew.
So far she has introduced two separate Best Girls.
You can't have two best girls.
There can only be one best girl.
Cooked_Auto ok but legit the pic a few tweets before that of using it as an emoji bar.
I very want.
MoonWolf they both seem like strong candidates.
Apparently one of them eats rocks?
Must have terrible teeth.
Or amazing teeth.
Fae do you have a straight friend? Yeeees?
Hs trinity series right now renolock grabs a zerus from a peddler.
Zerus becomes reno.
Dropped t7 at around half life v hunter with 2nd reno and jarax in hand.
He's really good at it.
Let's go harass an old man in a wheelchair I thought this was a nice game.
Noelor farming is a cutthroat buisness.
If i bought figurines imight get that.
But as it stands neat!
C'thun reno rogue.
Only at rank 20.
I got beat by a basic deck rogue other night.
Didn't play around assassinate two turns in a row followed by ass blade into deadly for pushing lethal.
Oh and then the reno priest with mind control on curve on a mal'ganis.
I still run mindcontrol >.>'.
It's a fun thing to do with 10 mana.
Yeah but its so SLOOOOW.
Unnerf plz blizz.
Buzzard would get unnerfed before mc.
None gender with left girl MoonWolf help I'm dying.
Try breathing excersizes.
I don't think memes are a gender this is a good video.
Is it ?
I'd have to watch it too check.
I mean what it actually is is two hours of Stardew Valley as backing for some very dumb nerdy craic.
Also currently a patreon bonus video for whatever that's worth.
I don't have the money to patron people ?
It's also y'know.
On youtube so in theory I could just forward you the link but you don't actually want to watch it.
I'd watch it as a proper lp probably.
Not as a longplay stream thing.
I might read Mega's SSLP of it if I have a spare day at some point.
So far I think berseria is my #2 tales game. The combat system is a bit too simple and the gearing can get kinda grindy but other than that its awesome.
Which is 1?
Was assuming that or Abyss tbh.
Dont think I've played abyss. Should do that once I get over the fatigue after this.
Well after nier automata maybe.
I love how miserable this game is at times.
The FF8 LP renamed Bahamut Thanks Obamamut.
Ftrbzzs MoonWolf.
've seen it.
Doesn't fix the biggest issue.
The best way to do damage is still to convert your damage to chaos and apply poison.
No true you can also convert it to fire and ignite them.
All Threshold Jewels now require 40 of their chosen attribute to be available in the area and no longer require it to be allocated. best change though.
The list of emoji is weird sometimes.
There are emotional cat faces.
But only one dog.
Also 5 different monkeys.
Clear anti dog bias.
🙈🙉🙊 🐵 and 🐒.
I get the three but unsure why monkey with body is included.
There are also two different whales!
I feel like I'm OK not seeing any emoji.
Normals ruin everythign how can we make text-based communication worse? oh lets add pictures.
Literally the opposite.
Omfg Big O blu-ray? I will be buying that.
Yeah I couldn't remember who here found that most interesting when I linked it =P.
I have it downloaded in some weird format but the quality could be better also the computer it's on is dead.
Fucking K6BD so pretty.
Their 1-panel updates are all ridic.
But so good.
You can find tiny details all over.
It's a good ridic.
Giant angel statues in the way of your city ? just build all over them.
Omg the angel-as-skyscraper-foundation thing.
Noelor are you ready for more magick knights ?
Best girl Umi.
Huh. finally a boss I am having trouble with.
And by trouble I mean taking more than 3 tries without using items.
Whats your difficulty atm ?
Still one below hard.
I must point out there are at least 2 difficulties above hard as well.
Have you played these games on higher difficulties?
I can do it but its a chore every time.
They are grindy as fuck.
Enjoy this 20 minute bossfight.
20 minutes is an optimistic estimate tbh.
I wonder how long that dragon took me in zestiria. time to check the logs I must have ranted about it.
Yeah some bosses took me at least 40 minutes.
That's a lot of Tidal Wave!s.
Well that was kind of bullshit boss.
MoonWolf I was wrong about the weirdest profession that clickable ads think they can make furious.
Give me a minute to upload.
So he has a move that covers about the whole battle arena deals ~70% of my party HP in damage and it turns out he can cast it again in the time I am animation stunned.
If only my pride would let me continue the other save where I beat this guy without getting max bonuses.
I'm sure they are not.
Maybe it's a new tactic.
Instead of making people click the ads because they're actually interesting.
Making them click to find out what the fuck even.
Might work for like two clicks.
Woo beat the boss properly this time.
Getting close to end game they finally started selling elixirs. I cant afford even one.
That seems fine.
In comparison its 10 times more expensive than the most expensive piece o gear I have bought so far.
It's not like you'd use then.
Hey I might need them.
I actually might need them later final bosses in these games are usually a hour long marathon.
Just discovered this emoticon exists on LP Zone possibly also SA and I haven't seen it?
!note MairBear apparently a FFXIV charname Yuki Hamsterlady.
Ok LP Zone is a for deals good place.
Also for reals.
Up here my general waste bin disappeared while I was on holiday.
Well time to stay off 4chan for the next few weeks.
Nier automata is out in japan.
MoonWolf that photo certainly was something.
Its so embarassing!
She eating an apple.
Like a ... person would.
MoonWolf the Diablo 1 bag is *so small*.
Also so little actual gear slots.
Armor rings amulet weapon helm.
Best girl Umi. <- p much.
I'm happy we can agree.
I'm just as surprised as you are.
I would have expected to like Fuu more.
But Umi is just aces.
I mean except for the slut-shaming but I'll give her a pass on account of being a 13-year-old living in 1993 Japan.
Maybe this is also why they have extensive dialogue about kitchen and other household items and their state of upkeeps.
Also I'm on the wikipedia page for characters in this series.
So first of all Note many characters' names are either taken from or related to cars.
They muts be lesbians then.
Actually a thing on purpose what d'you know.
Cars are lesbians?
Nanoha has a character called Subaru.
Well /tg/ did write a Car Lesbians game once so I would imagine as much.
Not a coincidence.
She's gay as fuck.
In some language adaptations Umi's name was changed to Marina and Marine. nice consistency of obvious naming there.
MoonWolf find me a character from Nanoha that isn't gay as fuck.
Fuu is notably the only Magic Knight whose hair and eyes do not share the same color base nice.
Nanoha's adopted sister and brother.
Who are doing the whole its not quite incest but its pretty much incest thing.
In the manga Umi is apparently a fan of Häagen-Dazs ice cream Denny's and MOS Burger she becomes panicked at the thought that Cephiro does not have any of these.
Also this article has spoilers that I am really excited to see.
Noelor you should google subaru gay car.
Including where the name Rayearth comes from.
MoonWolf I'm aware of the Subaru-is-for-lesbians thing.
But yes it's great.
Its not CLAMP thought it sounded cool ?
MoonWolf well ok that.
But also it's an in-setting thing.
I thought subarus were for tossers who saw that blue and gold trim car win alllll of the world rally stuff so they drive them at 50 in a 20 zone fuck over the exhaust to make them sound like a freight train.
They can b both.
The slogan for Miryang is Miryang is also the city of cultural tourist destination and superb cultural relics and picturesque places combined with beautiful nature because I don't think they know what slogan means. v.
Maybe its better untranslated.
I doubt it.
The slogan for Busan is Dynamic Busan which... I don't even know what that is. Busan IRL is a nightmare to get around.
Decided to read a Cities Skyline LP in this case and all the starting areas are based on South Korean cities if you hadn't gathered as much.
Here's some other winning Korean city slogans I.Seoul.U.
There were more but that one stood out.
That one is okay.
Here's the rest.
There are a surprising amount of Koreans posting in that thread by the looks of it. Or people who has visited it.
Here's some other winning Korean city slogans I.Seoul.U <- it's true that slogan is a fairly common sight there.
MoonWolf am I right in thinking that D2 actually *added* ammo as something you had to pick up and/or buy?
Pretty sure that was the case.
And then they got smart and removed it for 3.
It'll probably be back for 4.
Yeah it was a bad idea.
Also i hope not.
I mean quivers as seen in 3 are nice.
You could get rare ones! in d2.
Did they actually give infinite ammo?
You can repair them for a refill.
Don't ues the last one though.
They go away then.
Sorry i am misrememering.
There was only normal arrows.
That was mods.
Otoh it looks like in D1 money takes up a bag slot so fuck everything.
5k per stakc.
Was expecting a number of 9s.
There is a very good reason i remember that number EXACTLY.
You played D1 far too much.
And you'd store your money in town in piles on the ground.
Because there is no stash.
The ground is your stash.
The roads of Tristram are paved in gold coins.
That would have been a cute addition to the D3 D1 flashback.
Mostly the town squar really.
Piles of 5k goold would have ben great.
Tristram is the town square.
Plus Adria's hut and the other bank of the river where Wirt lives.
There are both potions and scrolls of healing?
So there is poitions of healing/full healing.
And there is a healing spell.
And there are scrolls for basically all spells.
The blacksmith has an awful Accent.
It was a rhetorical why.
On behalf of my tortured ears.
It was a rhetorical videogames.
Butcher was pretty underwhelming.
He was scary.
Thats a very important thing for this whole game.
Oh I'm sure.
However when you learn you can trap him in a room and shoot him through the shut door.
What class is the lp'er ?
Ah yes a j-pop concert with an anime-powered eclipse and flying saucer.
Also an anime-powered bustier for that matter.
Pretty normal day in japan then.
Anathema This is honestly pretty cool.
Daejeon = First syllable day second syllable is tough because eo isn't in English. If you say oh and uh at the same time you're pretty close. v.
Oh god what.
GlennCuttlefish is Zestria worth a sale price.
Or should I just hold onto my money for Bersaria.
MairBear depends. I think it was one of the weaker tales of games but it did have its moments.
Oh its going to be one of those encounters is it.
Boss is 50 levels above me.
Well got him down to 10% or so and then a party member died.
Had to reset.
....the boss has a self resurrect.
Its really going to be one of those.
The boss has MULTIPLE self resurrections.
Grade rank Victory over powerful foe +110.
Deaths 16 -117.
GDI pokemon V.
For a lark and free mega stones I was prepping for an online competition. I decided to put a garchomp on my team so I transferred it from AS into Moon and it wasn't allowed I thought because it came from B/W or earlier and thus didn't have the not a hacked mon print on it....
So I caught another in Y levelled it up sent it over... still not working because the real reason is you have to have caught it/hatched it yourself?
Sooo back to square one so probably just gonna sub in something halfway decent and go with that D.
Cloudflare compromised time to change password peeps.
Pirate metal band.
Ok cool just checking.
Tweets i was not expecting from CS include this one.
Reading more of Dungeon World while waiting for tests to run it seems really cool.
The warning to not plan too much out fill be with apprehension though.
I searched for Space Pirate on Google.
Just that and with safe search on mind you because on the work laptop.
This should be good.
Pressed page down three times found Samus Aran in bondage.
Ofcourse you did.
Mostly safe search.
Fully clothed but still spreadeagle on some sort of platform.
Noelor sfw.
Worlds most elaborate loss edit.
I genuinely went to go check if that was real.
Thoes windows have no figures behind them in the actual thing.
I would not have been surprised.
One thing I dont like about berseria is that it still uses a shit gear system.
I want my quest progression super weapons instead of this random drop bullshit.
I have once again accidentally spent way too much time working on a thing.
Only to realise I've just recreated an existing function of Excel.
What did you do this time?
Recreated the old layout of pivot tables using lookups formula and on-event scripting.
Because I tried creating a pivot table and didn't like the layout.
Then noticed a table I someone else's spreadsheet that looked different and found there's just a tick box in the options to revert to old format.
Which in my spreadsheet ends up essentially the same as what I'd made.
Rip your time.
Tbh each individual part of the process involved learning something useful.
So I'm not too mad.
This might have been a terrible mistake.
I just entered the cutscene trigger in the final area. And I also just realized I did not restock on life bottles after the boss yesterday.
Nah. You know how I always say I might need things later?
Full stacks of just about any imaginable healing items except for elixirs.
Goddamnit internet stop dying again.
Oh dear just had a game of heroes brawl end 69 kills to 6.
With a 4 level advantage.
Goddamnit blue team?
All auto attack heroes vs numerous blinds.
With a bit of multiple melees vs kt.
And then I go into a practically complete reversal.
Solo warrior tyrael going full dive 1v5 mostly with only damage from 2 falstads.
There's only so much squishy a double support comp can keep up.
But 2 wins from 3 I've had worse.
God I love those moments when you're idly interrogating your decklists and you go what the fuck is barnes doing in my dragon priest list.
Hoping for ysera!
BwaS I wish I had thoughts like that. I just accept out of place cards as some reason I can't recall.
Fapon Maface Player names intensify.
MairBear i just realised that swordmaster is a synonym of edgelord and Fire Emblem and its romhacks suddenly made much more sense.
Omg Scotland.
Take anything seriously please.
Well the irish entry is just cheating.
And why did you link the welsh version.
I thought I just linked the whole page.
So did you hear how a while back someone got bored and created metallic hydrogen?
Well the scientists who were studying the thing lost it.
As in they dont know where it is any more.
What a weeb.
See Likes and Dislikes.
Also look at this straight-up magical boy with his henshin motto.
Noelor literally a kamen rider.
Also holy fuck I just noticed Teradeath.
MoonWolf only instead of a bug suit well this is a game about idols...
Does he at least have a silly device he has to slide/insert/press buttons on to use his powers ?
There's just a pose.
Same as the other Pers- Mirage Masters.
Holy damn LP Zone has a live-updating preview pane on its reply box.
Her weight though.
Tiki is a vocaloid in this game.
Took me a while to get where that was going.
Great. now I have that deus vult parody in my head.
MairBear btw if you are still considering getting zestiria on sale might be worth it if you are going to play berseria at one point anyway since the two are linked.
Linked story wise.
Or linked in bonus content for having a save?
Linked story wise.
Its the same world but the games take place....1000 years apart?
Also if you do get around to playing berseria for the love of gods play it on japanese voice acting.
This is unsurprising xD.
I finally got my shit together for the pokemon challenge and keep getting swept x3.
I won a round \o/.
A very relatable comic.
Of course that's how Reaper plays a sax.
I mean yeah.
But I hadn't really considered it.
Oh nvm it was the old one =p.
That was a quality Ranolsode of Steven Universe.
MoonWolf these txts from last weeks AH are <3.
Playing jade druid sure is fun when your deck tracker doesn't account for jade idol shuffles S.
Oh tales of games and your post game shenanigans or might just be endgame and I missed it go fight against this boss at level...I think I am nearly level 70.
The boss is level 150.
And that was FONV finally finished for once.
Oh they finally changed the Delete Local Content prompt to Uninstall on Steam v.
!note noelor clas ohlson in town are on a closing down sale if you're into that sort of thing.
BwaS oh my god todays herostorm carbot.
I haven't giggled this much to one of them for a long time.
Huh I know I shouldnt be surprsed at there being Claes Ohlson stores internationally but here I am =P.
So perfect matches them all.
Especially after that rework patch that made murky first ban material in grandmasters.
I love that carbot pandaren are just a giant circle with ears on a tiny rectangle body.
The abathur dragon knight one is probably my favourite.
Dear god a new reason to finish the new hildebrand.
<- This emote.
Oh dang it's different for each race and gender. So I get the eeeh it's alright.
MairBear hildebrand its mostly emotes.
Dear god.
Well that explains why my hands are kinda freezing after 40 minutes out there.
Phone claimed its -5c its actually -10.
MairBear the female lala one is kinda terrifying.
Maybe because I just hold healthy dread towards smiling female lalas.
Name one evil female lala.
All that tells me is that they are better at it than males.
Gaius was really 3 lala females in a suit of imperial armour.
Well would be except gaius did nothing wrong.
Bwas is the second person to tell me about that shop shutting down.
I still have no idea what or where it is.
Other than that the first person to tell me had found four or five small bins there each containing a single polystyrene cube maybe 5cm wide.
And that person took only said cubes.
!note MairBear.
Cavalry seem op.
Goddamnit I need to get off the internet for 2 weeks or something.
Getting too paranoid about spoilers.
Young and Lesbian Croydon's Baristas.
SEX ARCHIE is now listed on iTunes and Stitcher!
General Ironicus puts his voice to many tasks.
Legion gearing starting to get complicated.
Juggling ilvls vs legiondaries vs tier set bonuses.
Confession. I think I might really enjoy jade druid.
At times I wish there actually is someone reading my google searches and I am not feeling pointlessly paranoid at times.
Just so I can justify searches like authentic goat screams.
I was going to comment about voice acting for Godbert but I suspect his voice is not meant for the ears of mere mortals and we wouldn't survive the experience.
Berseria gets kinda broken in the ex dungeon. I can atm pull off 2 mystic artes in a minute fight.
In trash fights I can spam the move that builds limit gauge every 2 seconds.
Wait what? v.
Until blizz fix this problem I'm not playing arena - Kripp. On being able to go 2nd.
Oh my bad. Not just that. Also because he can't choose his opponents class.
Urgh I'm exhausted.
MairBear untill blizzard lets me maximize my winning odds.
Personally i'm not playing arena untill blizzard gives me an i win button.
Until blizzard lets you edit your opponents hand.
But doesn't let them at yours.
Its the only way for arena to be fair.
And yet he's a calm person who enjoys the game when it's the same rng in wild.
Like he was legit having a good time.
But of course going 2nd does damn you for 90% of arena games...? As does ... priest opponents?!
Seriously priest? I thought their arena game was middle of the road at best.
That title is completely unrelated.
Ftrbzzs Dave Webster is wearing a suit I am weirded out.
Anathema oh LDC?
Good luck to them.
Oh man so is Harry.
I'm very confused righ tnow.
I managed to accidentally find a fetish meet yesterday evening.
But everyone assumed I was there on purpose because I was wearing make-up and my leather coat.
Anathema he still around? wow.
So it took me a while to work out that's what it was.
Kirisu you should consider a career in undercover operations.
A friend was there and she was like oh is this your first time?
It was both great and awkward.
I can imagine.
MoonWolf D1 was hard-core only?
Eh... sort of.
It had actual save files save files.
No respawns but you could just load the save again.
Ah fair enough.
Oh hey LP Zone has @ing.
Lp has many modern features.
But it looks so bad.
Iirc make the site prettier is one of their patreon goals.
Are they holding the site being nice to look at hostage behind money.
Also it looks way better on mobile than SA.
I mean yeah.
SA is an ancient forum version invented BEFORE SMARTPHONES.
Well that's not hard SA still uses fucking tables.

I really hate that giant unscrollable bar at the top pretending to be a menu.
At least it grabbed my gravatar.
You shouldn't use gravatar.
Why not ?
They track you and sell your data.
So does THE WHOLE INTERNET.
P much that.
Google tracks me every advertisement tracks me youtube tracks me.
The gravatar ids are md5 hashes of your email address and those hashes are basically disclosed to anyone who knows where to look = yet another source of spam.

I think I danced too much my knee is painful.
Luckily I keep all the painkillers in my drawer.
_all_ the painkillers.
What are you anathema Geoff the 2nd?
I remember his pill popping in the office..
And his bad knees.
Never sure whether it was painkillers or sedatives.
I remember listening to his knees pop.
Yeah one of mine does that too.
I had a bad dream last night where I had to play guitar in front of people but then it was out of tune and I couldn't tune it without help and then I couldn't even play to the rythm.
I know you can play.
I think it was brought on by thoughts of trying to get good enough that I could join the scratch band at next years IVFDF even though I think folk is quite hard to play at least in part because they just give you sheet music and I cannot read music.
The more you do it the better you will get.
Brutal facts by ftrbzzs.
That's the problem doing it p.
Very hard to sit down and be shit at something after a days work.
Anathema slowly but surely.
I might need to get a teacher again knowing what to do next on my own is hard too.
I would recommend that.
But doing is hard.
I'd rather wallow in self pity and mediocrity.
Who am I kidding I'm not even mediocre.
But I do have the self pity part down to pat.
And the lack of self confidence.
I am actually doing as well just had to take a break from drawing with the flu and fallout 4. and tales of berseria. and in 2 weeks nier.
Granted I am in the research stage for a story based on my DD5e Ravnica character.
Huh they actually released the trailer in response to the leak. Nice.
I've started the process of creating characters for Panic at the Dojo which I'm running with my flgs group.

I wonder what the rogue one will be.
Volcano because we're taking Elemental Destruction out of Standard and Spreading Madness sees so much play right now.
Whispers of the Wisps. Could bring in Archimonde warlock legendary?
Archimonde if your opponent has 7 wisps you die.
Oh good the main site has the key art as wallpaper already excellent.

Wake Me Up Before You Un’Goro. oh dear.
Oh nooo.
The fuck was that game.
So here I am farming mats in the very first area.
Well not very first but almost. And suddenly I just get horribly murdered by these mobs.
I check their level and they are level 140.
Next pack and all packs previous ot this level 7.
Same mobs as everything around them.
Didnt even get any extra XP or anything.
Who Saw Anything Un'Goro Themed Coming Am I Right?
You Are Indeed Right.
It came out of nowhere.
Just like the devilsaur that stomped my level 51 hunter.
Wait is Elemental a new tribe keyword?
Or did I just not pay attention these last years.
Yeah it's new.
Nevermind it got answered.
I meeean.
Imagine having to summon 7 deathrattle minions in one game - did... did he never play Naxx before the undertaker nerf?
Well then it was double undertaker double haunted creeper double leper gnome oh look I won.
Oh shit you're right. That's only 6.
I'm sad the reddit theory was wrong.
That the quest would be survive to turn 7 an equally difficult objective these days.

It's so out of nowhere too.
Goomy The weakest of all Dragon-type Pok�mon it�s unable to breathe if its skin dries out so it sticks to shady places. / Its source of protection is its slimy germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing.
Goodra An amazingly friendly Pok�mon but if left to itself loneliness overcomes it and it oozes gooey tears. / It gets picked on because it�s meek. But then whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail.
But nope Sligoo has to melt and devour the world...
Noelor we were just discussing goomy and co.
Good lord Sliggoo's entries this time.
Noelor did you get too the tantric sex yet ?
Is the pokemon that cries when looking at what used to be its human face still grim AF?
MairBear idr it.
Anathema no 'dex entry for that one this gen.
Also Umi' diary.
This Pok�mon�s mucous can dissolve anything. Toothless it sprays mucous on its prey. Once they�re nicely dissolved it slurps them up./ It has trouble drawing a line between friends and food. It will calmly try to melt and eat even those it gets along well with.
Also umi's everything this episode.
Still best girl.
Still not sure how she got into a childrens game.
Ratings board didn't get past the Lost Woods.
Also see my comment about the progressive moderness.
I wanna say that's pretty standard for the time.
MoonWolf depressing password wore off.
So it's now metal af instead.
My body is made out of swords.
Its pretty metal.
Also v long.
Secure passwords are also pretty metal.
Oh I can't note to myself any more.
Reflexive pronouns are a fucking weird conjugation btw.
Damn those middle gloves got a buff.
>Kill a triple-Essence monster holding a Talisman while in a map with a Tempest.
>Kill an Invasion boss while it is possessed by a Tormented Spirit and under Onslaught.
Noelor why can't you note yourself ?
Anathema at least they didn't require specific ITEMS to kill them with.
Did they do that in Breach?
I haven't played in like 6+ months really remember p.
No breach was meaner.
They wanted you to grind out perandus stuff.
I hope you enjoy spending tons of chaos on all your maps to mod on perandus through the map device.
And then getting lucky.
MoonWolf are you playing in Legacy?
What's the party size 5?
Also there one where you needed to defeat a specific breachlord in a regular breach only she's the rarest breachlord in the rarest kind of breach.
And its the chaos damage one so she's murderous as hell.
Mostly people didn't see that breachlord in a regular breach and well chaos damage.
Hope you're playing a CI build.
Thursday evening I will be able to read the patch notes and try come up with a build.
I'm playing either essence drain or flameblast totem.
They nerfed bonus area nerfed = made it linear instead of quadratic.
Fine i won't have screenwide flameblast totems then.
Just 75% of the screen.
MoonWolf I meant I can't set a note on my phone such that I will get it on my PC.
Oh because of the name thing.
This is why PatternSpider needs a !remindme.
Feel free to write in in maintainable code.
Clearly you did not listen to me.
I'll figure out what went wrong with the mumble plugin.
What went wrong is that fsharp and fsharpcore have weird interdependencies and don't just give you exactly what you need in the debug directory for your libraries.
Even though it runs fine under debug.
Which is infuriating.
!note MairBear i'd play it in my murlock deck.
MoonWolf yeah but you can fix that with the right tweaks to the fsproj.
I tried tweaking it for 2 hours.
I gave up.
Rewriteing it in c# so i wouldn't have that problem again was less of a pain in the ass.
Its not the first time i had a problem like that with that plugin either.
Or just always reference fsharp.core in PS maybe with a binding redirect to the version.
That shouldn't be neccesary .net can load libraries at runtime just fine.
Every other plugin is a .dll loaded a runtime loading its dependencies at runtime.
Ok but we don't have this issue at work when mixing F# and C# so obviously I fucked up somehow.
MoonWolf I've probably noted this before.
But that looks like a Dutch Hearthstoner username.
Noelor that is in fact 2015 european winter champion hearthstone champion Thijs. who is dutch. yes.
Also some other tournaments.
Anathema know what i did tis morning.
Fucked with my stash tabs in standard.
Didn't write f#?
Also realized that apparantly my master progress doesn't get merged down d3 style.
I have too many to manage.
So i'm back to having no hideout.
MoonWolf it should?
Well it didn't ?
There was a post on the forum about it being delayed though.
It was a bit annoying going to my hideout and finding one guy there and none of my stuff.
And his level was 2.
I dunno how the merging works it might only be master xp.
What's your favourite topping? Is a question that is very sensitive to additional punctuation.
Noelor best to cover as much ground as possible.
MoonWolf I meant that What's your favourite topping? is very different.
Since its ambigious its best to let them know your favourite topping and if you like topping.
Ah I see.
Yes you're probably right.
...Why is my username in that link.
What does that do.
Just make me a metadata maybe?
!note noelor i have no clue probably tracking who links things to the internet.
Addressed an issue with the interaction of Wrath’s card draw timing in conjunction with Daring Reporter. ayyy that sounds good.
Not sure if that is coffee anymore after that point.
Bahahaha hate these types.
Its caffience infused sugar.
The best way to enjoy coffee.
MoonWolf Did you remove the OTS r20 room because I cant remember if I left that or not? v It sorta came up on a Skype discussion about previous campaigns in this case.
Wow Rage Orcs opening.
Oh gosh D8.
Did they clarify if Adapt is just discover from this pool of X or is it spare parts 2.0.
It's like a pool of 10 and each time you have an adaptation it's a choice of 3.
Harr Kabal theme card back and no Reno decks in my build.
Only 1 small time bucanneer to get 100 dust off.
I never drew a single one.
Gadgetzan packs were too busy telling me I should play anyfinadin >_>.
I meant to well played.
5/10 bm c.
So far hollow night is a fun metroidvania with one baffling design flaw.
You cant draw your map from the start instead you have to find the map vendor in each sub map.
Which you cant map.
Or have a map of.
Otherwise its a nice metroidvania with good production values so far.
GlennCuddlefish I think they're either selling lalafell poison or trafficking in corpses.
Buy your stuffed lala today.
All the adorable with none of the eternal malice.
Try our special stuffing-and-soil blend to grow new potatoes.
Cooked_Auto MoonWolf Did you remove the OTS r20 room because I cant remember if I left that or not? v It sorta came up on a Skype discussion about previous campaigns in this case <- i removed OTS to recover storage space.
!note Noelor.
Not sure why he's a team skull member exactly.... but I won't overthink it.
The Animate Weapon skill now has a maximum of 50 animated weapon minions that can be active at once.
Nerfed the best summoner build.
Ggg hates fujn.
Anathema remember how i said that leaguestones is something they want to carry forward instead of zana's map mods for accesing old leagues ?
This patch just took the league mods off of zana.
Siosa now sells all quest gems once you've completed his quest and the quests required to unlock the appropriate tiers of gem rewards <- best change.
MoonWolf wait are the notes out?
Guess I owe you an Ex.
Thank fuck I said on standard p.
I've since been informed that this change for now is only for the league and not yet for standard.
But i'm convinced they are using this as a test for making this the way it works.
I like how the first item on major features is lioneye's watch now has stairs.
...Oh no?
Noelor this probably makes some sense an an insult to your mothers femininity ?
Someone in the thread suggests it's an arcane way of calling her a whore.
THE JUNKIEST BOY.
Seriously this feature is starting to get on my nerves.
Cleared the entire zone without finding the map vendor.
Map vendor ?
Ok so get this crazy idea.
You make a metroidvania game right?
And then you dont give the player a map.
Instead you have to find the map vendor.
Who is who knows where in each zone.
And at this point you dont have a map for the zone.
And make it progressivly harder to find later in the game!
Oh and compass of course requiresa gear slot when on a map you have been on.
I think its been about as difficult in every zone.
GlennCuddlefish wtd game is this?
This in my mentions feed. someone quoting a tweet of mine from 5 years ago to possibly further their agenda.
Can someone tell me.
Out of all games.
Why do metroidvanias always have the worst walljumps?
Something to do with making game progress available behind them.
Yeah but its always the same flaw.
What they said.
Get gud scrub.
Its always the same deal its like walls are coated with glue.
And then you end up just sticking them spamming jump inputs and nothing happens.
I mean I most recently played Super Metroid.
And had the opposite problem.
But agree it's not a good tech to rely on.
If its well done its great.
Walljumps are the second best thing after double jumps.
Have you played Salt + Sanctuary yet?
For like 5 minutes.
It has walljumps doublejumps airdashes AND ceilingwalk.
Oh what a feeling.
Salt+Sanctuary a Soulsvoidvania with a Sphere Grid.
Someone should let Smurf know.
Sure japan whatever works for you.
What the shite.
I'll stick with Babymetal tanks.
But what if instead of metal they had muscle.
Poliece station evactuated because someone brought some old ww2 era grendes there.
Poor guy just wanted to do the right thing causes giant issue instead.
Oh crap its march already?
30 days until Britain commits sepekku.
Anathema it'll be great to see the pound go down even mroe.
GlennCuddlefish> february's a slack-off bastard like that.
MoonWolf so you're saying I should buy all the euros I'll need to go and see ftrbzzs now?
I mean it might not hurt actually.
Buy me about 60 of the bastards while at it?
Well here's what £/E doing now.
Reno dragon n'zoth priest at rank 21 on the ladder thinks they can harass with their legend card back lightbomb and dragonfire.
Double old murk-eye had other ideas get rekt son.
No worse than the Attack the objective! spam.
Symmetra pick on control map. puts teleporter 5 yds outside spawn.
Double zarya on offence. call out barrage ready. graviton surge dropped only after defeat is called.
With red zarya getting 2 gravitons off that round.
Noelor hun indeed.
Of course this exists.
Noelor if it makes you feel any better the creator is a bit of a nutcase from what I've heard =P.
Their game got banned from streaming on twitch and they lost their shit over it.
Among other things.
I am very surprised by every turn of this story.
Now we can be the idol group it seems.
We're putting server browser in OW it's an unreadable mess! all the games are either full or just have the host in there twiddling their thumbs. Oh and they all like to play our worst game mode!
But they didn't put capture the rooster in yet.
Pretty sure you can run CTF on server browser.
Huh apparently if you plug a Switch into a Macbook it's the Macbook that goes into charging mode. I wonder whose fuckup that is.
Omg I want these brawl heroes to be permanent.
Aya is just the best.
Aya has a terrible deck though.
I think i saw one card below 3 mana.
I know but I'd take her emotes and death noise over ALL the current heroes.
Also there's definitely a random element to it xD.
Played pirate before. Nothing. Played one thizs time 3 patches.
Okay thats bullshit.
I haven't got Kazakus yet and my opponent refuse to emote spam me c.
!note mairbear I found your reddit post.
This build looks fun p.
Ugh this just exploits so much idiocy with poe's mana system.
Lol 6 socket shavronne.
I notice this build has literally nothing to attack with besides hitting it with a sword.
A man can dream.
Wait no it has whirling blades!
Technically that deals damage.
Just whirling blades the monsters to death with your int build.
It's a party build.
The problem with that is that you need to be in a party in poe.
Have you tried that recently ? this game HATES parties.
Not recently but I did when I played CoC discharge p.
Oh bum I did cruel labyrinth last night with an old character on standard and forgot to enchant something.
Apparantly due to the way shit works if you have too many auras up in a party with an animated weapon build you can crash instances.
You're not doing anything weird even just brough a support build to 1 of the three normal summoning build.
What about SRS?
SRS tends to transition into Animate Weapon.
Some form of undead summoning SRS/Animate Weapon and Golems.
Right I should stop looking at builds and do some work.
LPZ slowly discovering Discourse features I guess.
Possible groups alphabet soup fan of LMC English or Chinese? patreon backer admin.
I don't get most of these groups.
Patrons admins gayblt sure.
But pengpals ? punchfolk ? alphabet soup ?
Peng is EITHER London Multicultural English for good/beautiful.
OR mandarin Chinese for fat traditionally with a positive connotation i.e. healthy.
The latter doesn't sound like pen though.
Alphabet soup is my term for LGBTQIAU+++.
Yeah that acronym has gotten away from people.
Sure be inclusive but inclusive is getting a bit... absurd for the actual usable as a word for people.
Hence alphabet soup.
Which I wanna say I picked up from Khaos/Minority Monsters authartist Tab?
I think I just found the most infuriating feature in a metroidvania.
A mystery lever.
I have no idea what it did.
GlennCuttlefish a veritable video game classic.
Lowered a platform 15 screens away.
At least you're not playing an adventure game.
Which btw MoonWolf I feel the need to tell you about a puzzle from the latest Dragon Lore update.
Oh sure. go ahead.
I'll get my cringing muscles warmed up.
You find a statue of a bird which... I think just clicking on it but possibly using an unrelated item on causes 4 holes to appear in front of it.
Noelor but the thing is this is a good game even with the few flaws.
You full these holes with metal balls collected from the surrounding rooms and an alcove in the statue's base opens up.
You retrieve a model talon on a rope from the alcove.
A few rooms later upstairs is a room full of pots.
When investigating the pots one and only one of them has a hole in the bottom.
Have you been playing fate of atlantis or something.
LP of a bad game called Dragon Lore.
Dropping the talon through this hole sees it appear above the bird statue where it clangs about and retrieves a key which shows up in the pot.
I could not see the key before that point due to that game's resolution.
How far away is the bird statue at thi spoint ?
I mean directly below you apparently.
A couple minutes of gameplay ago.
Filling random holes with roughtly whole sized balls is pretty straightforward.
The rest is pretty nonsensical.
GlennCuttlefish I'm glad you're playing a good game though.
I'm not stop playing good games and play something worse instead.
MoonWolf I dont think I have the time.
I have a week to finish this and yakuza 2.
Then its nier time.
I'm sure it'll get released on pc... eventually.
Yeah its out in japan already I've been having to dodge spoilers for a week now.
MoonWolf if that one trailer leak is to be believed it was supposed to be released on 10th on PC.
But I think it also got delayed.
Oh is that what you've been dodging spoilers for.
And if I think dodging spoilers is bad now just wait until the field trip to mine factory that is the seventh day when it releases in the US.
This makes sense.
GlennCuttlefish see i don't think thats going to be the actual date that trailer looked fine if they meant to show it they would have just showed it.
So stuff about it is wrong.
MoonWolf maybe so.
The fuck is even going on.
Is that fire ball ?
Spell totems + fireball + gwp I think?
Buttloads of cast speed.
And all the projectiles.
It gets better.
Oh god i got the the melee section.
Fireball with an MTX too.
Its dying so hard.
This guy does good vidoes.
ARRGH KILL THE POTATOES.
It shall give me nightmares in the years to come.
Hate weeks like this in Heroes.
Valeera free week so of course the one that shreds me in pvp feels like a wet fish when I use her.
Ridiculous that game actually.
Blue team abathur never leaves the spawn.
Locusts siege point goes no further than our fort line.
Has his hat on a li li all game and gets about 1k damage total.
Cheating the game to not get flagged afk.
From the way the OW subreddit is reading at the moment you could be forgiven for thinking it's a redirect for a certain isometric indie RPG.
This is not doomfist.
Where is my doomfist.
He gets mentioned.
Orisa as in OR-15-A.
Actually it's also a cultural reference.
Ok but how does it play.
Ps called it.
Its not a spider tnak... its a centaur tank.
I mean it certainly would fit the blizzard reasoning.
Tank meta is a problem.
Add more tanks.
GlennCuttlefish> Bastion meta is a problem. Add another Omnic with a Gatling Gun.
In todays episode of hollow knight Mistakes have been made.
Let's see what Jeff Fromtheoverwatchteam has to say about our newest robot friend.
I usually stream on beam but i might switch to twitch for switch cheers.
That sentence is why i hate the future.
Centaur lady robot is adorable.
As you linked that I was watching Jeff FTOWT explain that the robot is a lady robot explicitly because people don't think ladies can be robots.
Shodan and Glados say hi?
I'mma ship her with zarya and you can't stop me.
Good old fashioned power creep to take a dominating effect from one hero's heroic and throw it on the new one's rotational basic set.
Like alarak's silence.
You should be much more concerned about the aoe damage buff.
Than the vacuum.
The best wizard.
Oh god that head.
His name is Addlepate.
So now Bastion will shred you in .9 sec of wandering into his LoS instead of 1.1 sec.
These people should play return to zork next.
Its similar levels of bad and terrible cg.
Roadhog punishes players out of position. Where out of position defined by being outside your spawn.
Punishes players not currently behind a wall.
How dare players in an FPS seek to get the opposition in their FoV.
A real thing apparantly.
Symmetra's alt fire is your counter to Barriers! ah yes that orb with the projectile speed of a snail.
I have killed mroe people than you'd think with orb spam.
I once charged my ulti in the opening push of Anubis by just shooting the orb through the whole team multiple times.
1% hit is not in your favour however the 20% brings that up to 21% chance. Obviously worth.
Thats not how that works at all.
Deeper in the thread.
Evidence that it was worth taking.
I'm angry that worked.
Confirmation Bias is strong with MairBears.
Though legit I thought there was an odd aspect of the system that did actually confuse the numbers like it checks for a crit before it checks for a hit and if the crit succeeds it auto-passes the hit?
Noelor make sure you have sound on for it you'll thank me.
MoonWolf Fae on Dragon Lore Its like if you taught aliens that don't have a clue how humans talk or think how to play DD and then told them to make a game out of the campaign they did.
No seriously youtube I don't care about PDP's video titled Response.
Please stop putting it in Related.
Pdp needs you to know he's not an aweful person Noelor.
I don't really care though.
And also it has nothing to do with Dragon Lore.
If you are mad at robots right now play Horizon and be female Hanzo soloing the Omnic Crisis.
I don't want to play any kind of hanzo.
When I have a smaller single-player backlog I'll be interested in Horizon. Though P5 may well be out by then.
Oh Nier will definitely be out before my backlog is resolved.
Isn't persona 5 in like a month?
I guess MairBear has a hefty backlog.
I wouldn't call a backlog that can be cleared in a month long.
Cooked_Auto The Bullet is adorable.
Just wait until he gets the best companion.
Sir Junken is not As cute.
Sir Junken is the best.
Oh yeah ok he just got a little plume.
What a good little knight.
A-Gun-him of course.
Professional hearthstone commentary.
Code Geass was 2006? oi.
Not this shittu again.
Also this volume warning.
And here I thought we had finally got rid of lightning.
Well that outfit hasn't been offered outside of mog store since the Lightning Returns in game events.
So we're fairly safe.
Get enemy to 5 hp. With 3 ways to lethal.

Amazing gif there.
Lol @ this being a thing.
Anathema leveling is serious buisness.
Tempting to try zombie summoner.
Go for it.
Yeah think I'll do SRS / zombie / spectre summoner.
Maybe change to a more interesting build once I get some good uniques.
Should be solid.
Anathema some solid advice there!
Anathema the top comment made me giggle.
MairBear super important tho!
Can't risk injury.
MoonWolf I started reading book 2 of the expanse last night not sure how you can continue to argue it is hard sci-fi after the first Bobbie chapter p.
Outside context antagonist.
Anathema almost finished the 3rd book.
Then I got distracted by another book.
The whole point of the protocmolecule is that nothing it does makes any fucking scientific sense.
It's like.. it's out of this world.
Ok but aside from this wildly implausible / impossible stuff is a big but!
Mass Effect is hard scifi then.
No mass effect is sjust space opera.
How are we defining hard scifi?
Guess Peter F Hamilton's stuff is space opera too.
Ftrbzzs scientifically accurate.
Scientifically accurate and RELYING on that to some degree as part of it splot.
Its fine to break it stretch whats possible.
Any good examples?
So basicall anything with FTL is out.
Ftrbzzs The Martian.
No FTL isn't out.
Martian might be hard but it isn't science fiction IMHO.
Its just science.
Its a modern adventure in space.
Nothing about it is futuristic or more advanced not really.
Lots of it is stuff we can't do yet but might be able to in 50 years IIRC.
They have better rockets but they are not that much better.
Thats true for basically all their stuff.
Yeah but a lot of the stuff we can do today can't be done small enough / efficient enough to make it to Mars for example plus the one thing The Martian didn' really cover that well since it wasn't relevant to story is the radiation exposure.
Fuck that guy.
So when is brittain going to finally do the whole article 50 thing and start leaving ?
Should just go and join back up with Canada they're about as competent in military procurement so they have atl east one thing in common.
I don't news.
...I literally have no idea what degree of burn that is.
Sorry been reading too much about Canadian procurement fuckups recently.
It's quite something.
And the the UK has an Aircraft Carrier with no aircraft and also a recent history of majorly fucking up procurement of new equipment for exorbiant costs for no real gain.
Yeah that sounds like us.
See also our nuclear deterrent T B H.
You have one of those ?
Yeah we have a unclear sub parked off the coast of Glasgow.
And it costs a lot of money.
But obviously we can't get rid of it because... idk Theresa May needs gamma rays to stay alive?
MoonWolf CA's link is proclick.
Although someone suggested shipping her with d.va's MEKA.
Which was also hilarious.
Omg yes I saw that.

Why would you.
Ever think that was it.
Fae's brain is not great at words sometimes.

I'm fine with having a probe.
Could have given it a less shit name.
If there's no Artosis Pylon talent I will weep.
Also where is the reskins for all the othe race basic builders.
I can imagine the DLC skin could be Carbot.
They already have Mules but that one's been phased out from a number of heroes.
The mule talent was lazy as hell.
1145 PM GrimlockMaster Ok I just want everyone to be aware of the full title of the sequel.

Its finnish allright just was taken aback.

And then the POE servers died.
Well thats a nice bug.
Finishing the arena does not give you the rewards.
Which means I will not be able to get the max amount of spell slots or the best weapon.
Guess I will put that on hold. Good thing I just noticed nights of azure got released on PC.
And berserk but who cares about that.
Operation Jagged Hot center.
Wow holy fuck this game is off to a promising start.
Couldn't even get past the first tutorial.
Because the game had actually left the button required for it unbound.
For some reason this is a demographic category that facebook keeps in its advertising records.

MairBear very FFXIV.
Noelor that is really weird.
Found out why people only play agro reno or jade. Because if you don't play either you simply cannot win.
To be fair that one druid I was against played an Aviana Kun deck but because I wasn't agro he suceeded.

Jenna Moran has been writing Very Important exalted 3e homebrew.
Being on a horse-ness is substantially more surprising.
Hidden Horse Style is a combat style built around the idea that a horse your opponent does not expect is a horse that they cannot defend against. It emphasizes flexibility surprise and mounted combat techniques. This style originated with the spies of the southern tribes frustrated at how easily their distinctive horses would give their identities away but flourishes among the pirates of the west whose sudden unexpected.
Does it also require a towel?
But its final charm lets you retroactivly have been the horse your opponent was riding all along.
Your horse was prentending to be you.
And then you stab your opponent who now does not have a horse.

Could go with chef101 too.
As little as I care about the new zelda it does have some of the coolest dungeon designs I have seen.
In terms of aesthetic or map layout?
Observations of horses that had themselves practiced the tiger style sure thing Jenna.
Map layout. the aesthetics are not bad either.
I feel at this point exalted could not get more ridiculous if it was featured in a monty python skit.
Exalted came up earlier at my friends'.
The context being that Wednesday is apparently International Pegging Day.
Which reminded me of the time as an early plot in the alchemical game we made one of Autochthon's Divine Ministers the goddess of buttsex.
And that we later nearly met her but avoided her in case she was still mad about that.
International Pegging Day.
Who keeps track of things like that.
Well you played Overwatch with her saturday morning and I'm sure remember her username.
Oh right that one.
For Glenn and MoonWolf's benefit I have a close friend whose b.net tag is Lovebutts.
Some people just choose to be anal about things like that.
Jeez midnight in poland local time and they still haven't finished the Heroes tournament.
Observations of horses that had themselves practiced the tiger style sure thing Jenna <- i wouldn't argue with her.
Well dinner is in the oven but I expect dismal failure.
While preparing the meatballs it felt entirely too soggy.
Prediction proving correct so far. Dinner looked too terrifying to eat as of yet.
Pushed it back in for another 10 minutes so that it can ponder on its sins.
Its chicken mair. but in a form that started as soggy meatballs.
Another problem is that I did not have the right type of cheese so it just looks like a pale mess no matter how I look at it.
As it is now I am waiting for it to resemble charcoal before eating.
Ehh. turned out edible would have been better with the actual ingredients and properly prepared meat.
Okay jesus fine I'll watch this half in the bag episode youtube.
Just so I can get rid of that recommended link.
<- ok I am suddenly glad I uninstalled overwatch before this hit live.
GlennCuttlefish I'm pretty sure that's an SFM parody.
But it's close enough to the truth that I can't say with certainty.
This is ridiculous. Trying to get my 1 win in CTF brawl for the loot box.
9 games played now.
13th game is the win Dx.
Just so I can get rid of that recommended link <-.
MoonWolf Hidden Horse has possibly my favourite Terrestrial tag for any charm.
Its very good.
That one that describes the kinds of horses people can have?
Air castes have blue horses and depressed horses.
Urgh woke up exhausted with a headache so far drugs are not helping.
When I get home tonight I'm gonna try buy some gear and see if the build feels better would like to at least try it in maps / with and.
Sneakily checked poe.trade violent dead has gone from 1c to 2c overnight |.
Anathema how was your PoE session last weekend?
Not actually that extensive! Have only made it to Act2 cruel. I didn't get started until lunch time on saturday and spent yesterday lunch / afternoon having a nice roast in a pub with Emily some friends.
Wood pidgeon kiev for the starter was...interesting.
Ftrbzzs you gonna play too?
But need to find more time.
I was out most of Saturday as well.
Sunday I spent with my book that I still have 400 pages left of.
I've been reading book2 of the expanse when cooking / eating.
Shit is getting real.
I'm reading The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss.
But damn 900 pages.
This is me atm.
Anathema says it's private.
Anathema magma orb ?
<- my elementalist.
I see anathemas profile is a combination of exalted names and scottish.
MoonWolf you need to manually add the character name to the url for it to pick a specific one other than the one you picked in the web ui I think.
Well its the elementalist.
Instaed of the not elementalist.
MoonWolf what I used to kill stuff before minions were good / what I use to kill stuff to get bodies.
For some reason I can't find out who sells Desecrate.
MoonWolf don't suppse you have a Prisim Guardian or Victario's Influence?
I should add some PoE commands to PatternSpider.
I forgot this was a hildebrand chain for a moment but now it makes sense that this guy wants it to be a heretic simply so that the inquisition doesn't get its funding pulled because of the lack of heretical misdeeds going on recently.
Anathema i do not.
But i still have that two hander >.>.
Anathema because they added the solo selffoudn league there is now a vender of literally every gem you have done the relevant quest for.
Its the ghost in the act 3 library.
Hit him up.
Vendors now have a searchbar too.
Yeah I couldn't see it on normal still in act2 on cruel.
MoonWolf if I reroll I might be a Slayer so hold on to the hammer p.
If you really want to sell it go ahead though.
It'll sell for like 1 chaos.
~18c for all the uniques I want for this build.
3 of them are 1/2c 2 are 7ish.
I currently saving to 18c for the chestpiece i want and thats ignoring the cost of 6 socketing and 5 linking it.
Oh what one?
If it also had cast speed it would give literally all the stats my build wants.
After that i need the totems can't be stunned jewel.
Also good castspeed wands i can dual weild.
Anathema holys hit this thing is TERRIFYING.
Now I am not usually for cruelty against animals in your party but this cat keeps consorting with demons and worse of all eating quest items.
...well now that I read that sentence it did not turn out at all how I envisioned it in my head.
But the point is that cat is an asshole and I want to turn it into mittens.
Damn... power cut immediately after killing a raid boss that dropped loot when I was the only one who could take it n.
MairBear rip your loot.
Hit after I saw the window but before I could click so it got remanded to the abyss of aint no one using their weekly roll on an off class pair of pants.
Yay! The next boss dropped an even better loot D.
MoonWolf I heard you like rogue exiles.
Not that muh.
I should have taken today off work.
So... you end up with 8 exiles?
At least 8.
There could be more.
4 gaurenteed rogue exile each with an ally.
As opposed to 1 with an ally and with +3.
For some reason I started watching the tales of zestiria anime.
Is it terrible ?
I mean it is a tales of zestiria anime.
But no its actually not terrible.
There was one scene that looked really bad so far and I think that was used in the game as well.
I think this does things slightly different from the game or at least shows scenes in another light.
Cooked_Auto this showed up in my related videos and is always worth a reshare.
Just had dragon warrior opponent get a wonder turn 7 of brann double netherspite.
Now I remember why I stopped doing ladder in this game.
Noelor Yeah I've had that album for a while now and it has a couple of good other tracks.
Doesn't make it less shareable.
Am I right in thinking that all twitch chats are just irc channels?
Not technically but accessible as irc yeah.
This one obviously the best.
I cba'd finding that version.
MoonWolf we were discussing One Punch Man in Fae's twitch chat.
Gnome who isn't there but she DM'd him has in fact already statted Saitama for Panic.
Everything else -10.
Not how Panic stats work.
Hit should be for saitama.
It was actually something like stances that let you do nothing but build up tokens for two-three turns and then a power stance to unleash 15 damage at onces.
My alma mater students union bar getting renamed because patriarchy I suppose.
The 3 names they came up with.
1 a reference to the fact MLK visited us one time.
2 a reference to the old Roman name for the city that was an insignificant settlement at the time.
3 a British pub style name referring to 2 random symbols featured in the uni heraldry logo.
PoE is a bit daunting D8.
There is a lot to learn upfront nowadays yeah.
How soon even if immediately should I stop hoarding every white drop >.>'.
And immediately selling what isn't useful.
Starting out ignore white gear hoard currency beige keep your flasks upgraded only really bother with rare gear yellow you can sell them for useful currency items.
If you are using an attack skill keeping your weapon up to date is important less important for spells.
May be a little out of date.
Went with witch.
Lol this exists.
MairBear ingame name ?
You have picked what is probably the most overwhelming season to start playing this game.
You were the ones talking about it >c.
I'm just saying there is a lot of stuff going on.
When I get home I can give you a I don't need it now I've transitioned to 100% damage from minions.
Welp Ana just got the shit nerfed out of her on PTR.
Also junkrat no longer blows himself up.
Damage reduced from 80 to 60 healing from 100 to 50 grenade from 60 to 30.
Oh sorry those numbers were the grenade healing.
Also Zenyatta will be able to discord through barriers.
Discord through barriers will be great.
Does a discorded Rein's shield take extra damage too?
MoonWolf did you in fact see One Punch at the Dojo this morning?
Noelor i did in act see.
I actually really like that build.
Independent of being Saitama.
Not that I've even consumed OPM.
Maybe in the summer.
Wow the security questions offered on this service are very... American middle-aged normative.
What was your high school mascot?
What colour was your first car?
How old were you at your wedding?
Thats a thing we all have right high schools with mascots.
Some of these are INCREDIBLY insecure.
What is the name of your first child?
MoonWolf ^^^^^^ especially.
Things i can find out on facebook should never be security questions.
I mean security questions alone are terrible.
But those are especially terrible.
I ended up picking first school not on fb and hospital of birth.
Wait ana finally does less damage than maccree on a bodyshot? The skies shall be mine once more!
Also her grenade got halfed.
- sad for Ana nerfs.
I'm only sad if her shit got nerfed to trash tier.
But if she's just fair now then I'm overjoyed.
Did they touch her healing at all?
Yes her heal nade went from 100 to 50.
Grenade heal only though.
That seems a bit much with everything else.
MoonWolf I should use leaguestone things whenever I can right?
Just jam em in there.
The ones you get while leveling are level limited.
Saving them gains you nothing.
Don't use white Onslaught ones at all though.
You can trade 3 leaguestones to a vendor for a random one.
Yeah thats just a penalty for no gain.
Also some vid I found advised me about both chromatic items and how superior items have value en masse. o.
MoonWolf prophecies? D.
Prophecies are like mini quest thingies.
Well some of them are juts there are rats in this map now or a monster will drop a lot of rares.
Otheres are if you kill this monster with this specific item you'll get an upgrade for it.
Rule of thumb fill up my board of them and just wing it?
Personally i'd say wait for merciless difficulty.
Since they are tied to difficulty.
Ugh fuck whoever wrote this date calculation list.
I mean they've been consistent.
But they've used 30 days as the label for every calculation that adds a month.
35 days is 5th of the following month 60 is 30th of the following month...
Date math is hard.
If the label said +1 month and it always added 30 days that would be annoying but understandable.
But it's the reverse.
The software is adding an actual month and the label always says 30 days.
Including the word days this is a text string label.
They could have said months.
Write to the dailywtf.
Dear Mx Dailywtf.
Yup sounds about right.
This report is pulling directly from the database I said.
The fields will definitely fit their validation.
Nah mate nah.
Never EVER trust input.
Nope date field contains strings.
Specifically either a string that is a date value OR the string multiple.
Which I mean nice to know when a record has been signed to multiple dates.
Can't do maths to it.
MoonWolf price of that necklace I found has already gone down 1c.
Anathema I take it you bought early?
No no I just want to make some currency so I can afford all the items I need for my build p.
Not sold yet since you know cna't sell without being online and I'm at work.
I want a relic facebreakers currently the most expensive item in poe.
Valuable PLAYER INTERACTION.
40% more expensive that headhunters!
Headhunters = kill a rare gain its mods for 20s.
BiS belt for basically any build.
Tabula Rasa is 15c _.
Oh shit I just remembered Tabula Rasa.
One of the earliest oh hey MMOs are big bucks now immediate failures.
Though to its credit googling it did have Garriott on board.
May have started out as Space Ultima.
I kinda enjoyed it when I played an open beta for it.
But then again I never spent too much in it to make a bigger opinion than it felt okay.
I wanna say I played it at launch with my first year uni flatmates.
But also it would have had to be on Mac for that to be true.
Up to WoW I really only played open trials and such for games.
So my playtime to some has been rather limited.
But I remember liking Asheron's Call 2 the little I got to play it.
It felt comfy from what I can remember.
MoonWolf MairBear you should join ftrbzzs's PoE guild! it has like 3 people in it !
But we just made an ocd guild.
Rip us C.
Anathema I'm a monster.
I found out an exploit of sorts in necrodancer that makes Aria mode easy.
I can't remember Aria mode I mostly played when it was still early access.
Aria's gimmick is she cannot equip any weapon they don't appear and bought from gem shop kills you.
She has 1/2 a heart total. With a potion of extra life.
And missing a beat kills you.
She also starts at zone 4 and works upward.
Is she just extra hard mode ?
She is the hardest I've discovered so far.
But is also technically still part of story mode as she has unique cutscenes >.<.
Sure am glad I'm not a completionist p.
But yeah you have to be flawless and get damage boosting items fortunately since you die in a single hit it removes the draw back from two high damage items.
Or spoiler alert in that it will spoil the game if you do this mode go co-op mode and have player 2 be the guy who plays without beats.
Cos it affects both players. So you're freed of the missed beat curse.
I remember an exploit in early access in coop with one player as the monk the other player got all the shop items for free or something?
I still need to finish the monk too...
Was gonna go to the gym after work today but I feel a bit lightheaded from lack of sleep + hunger just now.
Following discussion with a friend scrolled back through my Twitter to find my fuck it done being male tweets.
Back in the distant past of January 2015.
That was a long two years tell you what.
2017 is going to be long too.
I coulda sworn it was at -least- 2014.
I've already had... 4 hair colours?
MairBear literally within the first hour of 2015 tbf.
Surprised the API could handle going back that far beyond an archive request.
You can scroll to the beginning of any Twitter feed.
It's not *recommended*.
For several reasons.
I'm sure it caps out at a certain N thousand.
You could scroll to mine in 3 mins D.
Pls do not.
Aww dammit MairBear.
You just reminded me of the disappointment of Blazblue's screenshot protection.
How? But aww.
Being a father robot to a teenage squirrel girl is still hard work.
MairBear because you had to reset your Twitter password iirc.
Only for Täger? to refuse to be photographed.
I don't think he bothers with any dots just a plain ol' 'a'.
Thing is right.
That game is out on PC steam so it can probably be screengrabbed from there.
We just need to pressure glenn into completing story mode.
Not happening this week.
Literally not the worst.
I mean that's more than I was expecting.
I was fully ready for a patented GlennCuttlefish hahahahanoooooo.
Heard it in my head and everything.
!note noelor I am actually open to the idea of playing blazblue if someone wants to see it just in no hurry to do do it on my own.
!note mairbear.
White Dwarf FB. Readers model of the week! Someone sending in a fucking gargant. Yeah wp there...
Calm down hugh.
Anathema ghosts in atziri are a thing in this league.
Just had an otherwise all basic warlock opponent drop a molten giant against me.
Handlock - IT LIVES!
No it doesn't.
Playing Rogue and my 400+ eurovision playlist shuffles on to the track named 'Miracle' <3.
MoonWolf got a temp lock for tryinbg to login too many times will get a tab tomorrow.
Well I need to go to bed anyway 'night.
Good old LFR the night before a reset.
Hitting bosses enrage timers and stacking determination.
So that was nights of azure. Rather mediocre.
Sylvanas on board enemy has 1 minion plays 19 strength c'thun into it...
Was he really gambling on a 50/50 vs a priest who hadn't played entomb of MC yet.
Anathema I'm so sad you left my PoE guild.
I barely slept last night.
Why did you do this to me _.
MoonWolf my LRT but imagine I somehow super-RT'd it.
Anathema oh god. To unlock the final character you need to finish an all characters run. I thought that would be each time you die/take damage/swap level it would randomise...
Necrodancer I should say*. But nope you have to finish the entire game with each character one at a time no game overs.
Ftrbzzs it was difficult.
MoonWolf my LRT but imagine I somehow super-RT'd it logged in 34 seconds ago <- hate you.
MoonWolf so in my work firefox I'm logged into my poe account in the browser and I didn't do it via steam!
Damn these noelormojis.
And not rendering in any way for me beyond being a square box with dots.
It was a purple heart.
0 regrets for joining the faeriefortune patreon discord gotta say.
Are you sure ?
MoonWolf nslaught Leaguestones that drop after this patch will now have 20% increased Quantity of Items found in the next area.
They won't be just a downside then.
Onslaught league sounds like it was pretty bad.
We made everything harder thats it.
Aww shit just realised I'm going to miss the first stream of Chaos Crew's new LP on Friday.
Because I'm having dinner.
Well just watch the video.
It's on beam I have no idea how it archives.
MoonWolf yes. Also it was a hardcore exclusive league.
Hope it just does.
Anathema get fucked hardcore players.
Back when SC and HC still had seperate league mechanics.
Think it was pre-release too.
Blue team pls.
99% on control point. and we recapture it 4 times.
Hmm probably should have had breakfast this morning.
And still lose n.
Yeah that is generally advisable.
I picked the wrong minion build this league.
Anathema yeah you did.
So how expensive is this now.
That one is quite cheap.
Not after that video.
Cheapeast copy of that weapon online right now 60C.
From what I can tell it's abusing a weapon that has a chance to cast Animate Weapon on kill + the bug that kills from dots from minions / totems are attributed to you normally when you kill things don't trigger from minions killing things.
Guess it'll be fixed tomorrow then.
Nah it's known to be difficult to fix.
Apparantly the item was 1c before that video...
Çan't die to reflect if its totems either!
Your totems do though.
So thats a pain.
Anyway I recommend tuning into on Friday at 4p.m. UK time.
MoonWolf new build idea.
When Remote Mine is linked in combination with the Trap Support inventory icon.pngTrap Support and Spell Totem Support inventory icon.pngSpell Totem Support or Ranged Attack Totem Support inventory icon.pngRanged Attack Totem Support gems the result is a skill that lays a mine. When the mine is detonated it lays a trap. When the trap is sprung it casts a totem which then can cast the linked.
But... is that any good ?
Ofc not p.
I don't know there might have been some weird edgecase where it magically produced tons of damage.
The only thing you can get out of it is extra corpses that go away when the breach closes.
Its really really pointless.
I just like that they added a Vaal counterpart to Portal.
I definitely appreciate this ship.
Noelor its a very silly part.
Considering MEKA are not in fact sentient.
And have blows up as a combat role.
But still cute.
Orisa has a blow up girlfriend.
Stupid overwatch. I want to love it. But it irks me so.
Want to trade my shitty reflexes for something that can shoot well.
MoonWolf thanks now I want to see a comic in which Orisa is very upset after Meka SD's.
Then very happy when it returns.
Well i'd draw it for you but i can't do any such thing.
So you'll just have to use your imagination.
Noelor why do you toy with orisa's emotions so C.
Heeeeeey gl- *presses tab fruitlessly*.
Where did you put Glenn?
Not in this channel.
Noelor cautiously saying 22nd for chargen / first bit of Dungeon World.
So last night in Ravnica 5e the party leveled up after washing someones hair. Not really but the timing was great.
Was gonna be next week but emergency holiday in Wales.
You could say that if we ran with XP but in this case we don't so it's a bit like 13A where the GM decides when we level.
Emergency holiday <- scary.
The sheep finally snapped.
Cooked_Auto the correct approach to levels.
Fuck calculating xp.
Especially if you are playing a game that gives xp based on monster kills and encounters have their set amount of monsters/Cr you should have in them and monster xp is based on their challenge rating/level.
We started at lvl 3 in this case as well.
Also known as a whole lot of extra work to say level up about every x encounters.
Aside from stat bonuses I only get one cantrip and one lvl 2 spell as a Wizard extra.
Noelor.
Now post it too reddit and get all the karma.
To get the reddit karma I'd need to draw a reapfield in the corner.
There better lines for clarity.
Now it's reddit worthy.
Looking at the posting rules.
I guess it qualifies as a mid quality shitpost.
There is ratings on shitpost ?
Well they don't approve of low effort shitposts.
MairBear so that was a mystery heroes game we played right ?
Because i died four times and was 76 all game.
So i was seirously doubting what i queued for.
MairBear I shared on fb.
...But with a z.
Hitting submit doesn't work CCCCC.
There I did it.
MairBear's first reddit post.
Diregarded Salmon ?
Did MairBear fix it yet?
Fix what yet ?
Who where now?
That Reddit link took me to a dead image.
Works for me.
Noelor.
Irrelevant but 3.
Okay off topic.
To downside of Mystery heroes is that you can lose based purely on luck and BS.
The upside is you can win for the same reasons.
Yeah don't you love it when your team dies and you come back with a completly useless composition.
So now the opposing taem has a free push to point or whatever.
Vs an enemy with a mercy who has ulted 3 times and has a 4th charged becasue no one can kill her?
Vs that ony guy that just keeps rolling 76.
While that was BS we did have one of those cases of inequality...
...plus our enemy running one by one was a perk.
This is an allegedly stunningly good sidereals 3e fan work.
How does it do for suprise horses ?
Not reading it now.
Oh man had a vs ai defeat on HotS for first time in a long while.
Featuring a split soaking cho'gall while core under siege.
And a valla with fuck-all wave clear.
BwaS you gonna be doing more? o.
Clearly you should have picked Viking to compensate.
Lost vikings on Tomb? eh?
How does playing TLV which I dont own get me xp on lucio?
Thanks for reminding me that the Proclaimers Musical exists Cooked_Auto =P.
Sounds insufficiently Scottish.
I mean it's Leith.
>film about a Scottish musical written by a Scot about a Scottish band.
>a British film.
English cultural imperialism intensifies.
Also probably affects its tax status.
It's okay as Grand Tour established in their Scotland episode that the Scots have practically invented everything and the English barely anything =P.
I can't imagine Clarkson even being on screen when that was said.
Sadly no one has even thought of uploading a clip of it on YT =|.
My other response was why would you watch that?
What should I add to my chili?
<- thanks for translating that bing.
Oh today we don't have a normal HS Brawl.
But a herioc one.
Gues i'm not participating.
What a shame.
Indeed no free pack for 7 days.
Blizz plz give free pack on heroic brawl kthnx bye.
Well you can go 0-3 on heroic brawl and get 1 pack.
1000g entry fee though.
Thats not really a good ratio.
Is a bit ridic they put it out <1 month out from next expac.
I still think it's a bit redic that the hearthstone new year is March/April.
TIL Lifecoach and Wifecoach aren't the same nationality.
Oh whats hers ?
Cool. so tonight I've seen patron warrior and flipping disguised toast priest on standard casual with my jade druid.
Tavern brawl paywall has brought all the funsies out tonight.
A hearthstone youtuber.
You know how si7 agent says ha this guys toast.
You can mishear it as ha diguised toast.
They could be patching valid things like the exploit that deck relies upon.
But no standard arena was the answer.
Its not technically an exploit.
All these interactions are as the cards say they work.
Unlike the same problem with entomb which is just wrong.
The madness potion interaction does make sense.
Gain control of a minion you already have on your side of the board doesn't feel like fucking give it charge!
Esp considering the nerf to the actual card Charge.
Okay the charge bit is unituitive since its never mentioned.
It wasn't summoned this turn therefore is not sleepy.
Would it be okay if the take controll for 1 turn cards had an explicit and give them charge on it.
Noelor it is summoned this turn.
!hs potion of madness.
Maybe but then you have to start considering the 'can attack heroes' qualifier.
So you summon a djinni and then you cast potion of madness on an enemy minion.
Djinni can now attack because it gained charge.
Because it copied the potion of madness effect because its after and after potion of madness resolves its a friendly minion.
And you do divine fire inner spirit shenanigans on it because priest to OTK your opponent.
And now you do the standard priest buffing into giant attack which the djinni also copies.
Because fun and interactive.
And now you have two 20+ attack minions that attack.
Man this zestiria anime is weird.
Out of 6 episodes 4 have been about tales of zestiria.
What was the rest about ?
Tales of berseria.
Also so far this series fails to capture how gay sorey and mikleo are for each other.
Strange gay baiting is all the rage.
Not actually having people have relationship though.
Who wants icky relationships to ruin our pure gay moonwolf?
You disgust me.
I wonder if they will ever make a third tales of game set in the same world. I kind of want one at this point.
Which world even ?
The one in berseria and zestiria.
From sound alone it feels like Vesperia should share world.
I know that's not how worlds work.
Yeah wouldn't fit in this one.
Building an aqueduct next to a source of fresh water and within one hex of the city centre gives extra living capacity.
With big enough tunnels sure.
So I just built an aqueduct on the other side of the river from Kyoto's city centre.
GlennCuttlefish living capacity in VI is an abstraction of how many people can live in your city in general not always literally housing.
No no let me dream.
There are now japanese people living inside aqueducts.
Presumably they'll have water-themed mechas when they have to battle demons that are a metaphor for Germans.
You know those times when you close out a day of Heroes.
Glance over the 'free week rotation' Heroes.
And suddenly all the plays you saw that day make sense.
Oh gods I just had one of those moments.
A moment where I fear people will not invent the machine to slap people with soon enough.
I was watching something naruto related and thought that looked pretty cool and then I feared I would not get slapped soon enough.
Fortunately the moment passed because its naruto.
Nice a Curse of Monkey Island LP.
Thats the...third one?
Commentary is a bit so and so and he could need a pop filter.
Well then you know whats better than a poor quality LP?
Playing the game.
Go go go.
Goddamnit here I am having regular dinner at half past 3 because I am good at adulting and this silly anime about dragons is making me need comfort food instead and its not even really sad.
Yeah I've heard that series is a gut punch at times.
Hah. According to twitch chat Heroic Tavern Brawl is just a cheap tactic to steal everyone's gold pre-expansion so people need to use the real monies.
They may not be wrong.
MoonWolf are rares worth identifying before selling if it's an item I won't use?
Not if you are low on id scrolls.
But they sell for more i'd.
Already at 33 or so.
Pick up every scroll late game maps it can be worth it to ID most rares even if you discard them on the chance that you get something good you can use / sell.
Aye I'm also picking up any 1 and 2 slot items regardless of quality.
Figuring that while it's not worth picking up an 8 slot white weapon for a single scrap of a scroll.
A ring or belt is maybe worth the space.
Pickup basically anything that is a set of linked red-green-blue.
They sell for chromatics.
Which are good to have a lot of.
Someone should let me see them win a game of HS.
I'm guessing this early on I should just hoard -all- the currency items?
I'd still only pick up the rare ones tbh a rare ring is gonna give you enough alteration shards to at least cover the scroll you used to ID it you can exchange 1 orb of alteration for 4 scrolls you should get 4-8 shards per rare 20 shards gives you one orb.
The extra time spent going back to town more often vs time spent getting more drops.
Later on you can hoard rares for other recipies actually too.
Selling rares for every slot = 1 chaos IIRC.
If you need id scrolls teleport scrolls conver into them 1-1.
2 rares with the same name = chance orb.
And wetstones 1-4.
I love me some chaos recipy but fair warning it basically eats a tab of your stash.
At high enough item level its actually a divine and not a chaos.
And lower its another one.
Wait not divine regal.
Which is a shame becuase regals are not as valuable as chaos >.>.
Regal = magic -> rare?
I used to know all this stuff.
Found an ex yesterday.
Also an amulet you might want.
I played for like 3 hours.
Does it have dex? I need the dex on my current amulet.
Oh that one.
I was considering Shaper's Seed for the allies regen 2% of life to help keep my guyes alive.
I don't know how to gear your character.
Just figured it could be good.
I'll try it out if I can fix my dex issue the minion speed might be good get the flying skulls places.
Goal for tonight cruel labyrinth.
Should be ez.
Aye I think ~3k combined health and ES now that should be enough if I'm not a careless scrub.
Yess price of Prism Guardian has dropped another c too.
I signed up to Tesla's marketing mail list a while back.
Basically for shits gigs.
You can drive a Tesla for as little as £564 per month*.
The mortgage payments on my house are less than half of that.
My rent is more than that p.
And its a shit house.
Anathema but it is.
We're still looking for a place.
It just seems that my vision of a cozy place and the size of it seems to differ from Simon's idea.
I'd be fine with a 2-3 bed max Simon looks for bigger.
Yeah my brother and his SO are considering looking for an apartment as well.
Why would you ever need more than 3 bedrooms.
He says writing from his 4 bedroom home.
They're going run it as an AirBnB obviously.
This is probably someones fetish.
All true facts.
I built a robot with my horse dentist wife is the name of my new light novel.
Reading it or writing it though.
I can't tell with light novels whats real anymore.
Is the titular wife a dentist for horses? Or a dentist who happens to be a horse?
Or is that the big reveal in the last chapter.
To all 3?
A horse dentist horse dentist?
MoonWolf the intent is the same as X is the name of my jazz quartet.
Or what have you.
X is a pretty shitty name for a jazz quartet ngl.
It only works as a logo.
Because the logo is a letter X made out of our four instruments.
Jazz quartet is the name of my trash metal band.
UNTILL IT IS DONE.
Which thing are you ok-ing ?
The band name thing was also good though.
Noelor you okay there ?
Phone being a butt.
Ftrbzzs when are you in cambridge?
I advanced the heating instead of the hot water so the bath I tried to run is colder than outdoors.
MairBear I guess the world rolled you.
Nah MairBear rolled himself.
Thats some arcane plumbing you have.
Good thing I have idiot proof showers.
Would be cold showers every night otherwise.
GlennCuttlefish It's not that bad D.
Noelor can confirm.
MairBear just like the old gypsy smashmouth said!
That is a terrible mental image.
And they don't stop coming.
And they don't stop coming.
Can't stop won't stop.
Anathema eeerm sometime between 15-22 of April.
We'll have our base in London and travel from there.
Free lodging at Simon's parents.
Was hoping a you were here on the 27th b I could persuade you to be my +1 to Brady Pub Quiz and get Pete to bring Geoff p.
There are about a handful of Brady people I want to see and totally not in a pub quiz.
Don't worry I selected just me.
Free beer + it's at the cambridge brew house this year.
So the free beer should be good.
Anathema not sure if I've been to the brew house.
It sounds familiar.
Ooh I have.
I remember now.
If true a very important Zelda fact.
Lets hope this is not a cruel trick to get someone to punch dogs in zelda.
Also update on discord they are immune to my personal shitpost style.
No Goblin knew we’d found the perfect translation crew for 100ft Robot Golf when they started filling us in on weird Frozen jokes that only exist in the Chinese redub.
One big thing we learned from releasing Roundabout on Steam was that people love settings and get cranky when there aren’t a lot of settings. We added so many settings to 100ft Robot Golf.
Source incidentally.
I'd say this is dumb but i know that TB at least literally has a part of his game review where he complains about the amount of settings a game has.
Or does not have.
Yeah that sounds like something TB would do.
Mists timewalking this week.
Forgot how ballsed up some of the dungeons that xpac were.
!note Noelor.
Fae You can be a witch in the sims 2 3 TIL.
You can be an almost anythin gin those games.
They have dozens and dozens of expansions.
These gay space rocks are wearing pretty amazing dresses.
Also omg the nose.
Also thanks for reminding haven't seen last week's.
Brb rebooting I guess.
Do twitter avatars carry transparency?
I suppose they wouldn't.
Good thing I don't care either way.
WELL <- lol.
I have an addon that lets me open private tabs without making a new private window for that.
I think I'm now Tedd everywhere except LPZ and SA.
MoonWolf Hikaru is good at helping.
Did i miss an update ?
Noelor> when did you get pigtails?
That's just a character I am/do like from a comic I like.
Your delegate has learned that Greece has denounced India I have never heard of this country.
But I know my friends think they're evil!
Oi turns out Saladin is paranoid.
Ie hates other civs if they have large militaries.
Paranoid or just a sensible way to aproach civ life.
Literally every other civ will just come invade you if they think your armies are weak enough.
Including Saladin normally - unsure if paranoid over-writes that or not.
Pretty sure hate makes it more likely for them to invade your of ally with invaders.
Also there is a Germany between the two of us so.
I'm more concerned about protecting myself from Barbarossa than assuaging Saldin's paranoia TBH.
My current total war campaign is stalled out.
Almost finished war with one faction allied with other big guns no other war status.
And my playstyle is never one to start them but go hell for leather when they do until they're dead.
More games should have rocket-powered horse-bikes -Noelor 2017.
And I will stand by that statement.
You know on the whole that doesn't really explain much but i'm not going to ask.
Well idols don't ride horses.
But their Fire Emblem-sonas are cavalry.
Its also gone fuzzy better throw it out.
Koi Ball indeed.
!noelor Tree of life is dead. better go get the one leaf it still has. Clearly the biggest issue right now is the leaf not the DEAD TREE OF LIFE.
Fine ass leaves.
!note Noelor Umi is def best girl.
MoonWolf MairBear.
I have this one.
Its a bit simpler.
Half a level and I can use the last two build-enabling uniques!
You can alt + click-drag to select vertical columns of stuff!?
I know you can do that in sublime.
Where else ?
Visual studio the console.
What even are cats.
Teenage girls it looks like.
Anathema just found one of these.
!note Noelor.
Also MoonWolf ^.
Cismale colleague tried femme jeans complained that the zipper is too small.
And I'm like... friend.
Wait until he tries the pockets!
Anathema also the pockets.
But that one is more reasonable.
And less of a You have forgotten who is supposed to wear these.
Also they have a lot less room in the crotch too I think?
Also this came about because I'm wearing new jeans I got from Primark last night.
And they have actually no pockets at the hip.
Not even the silly illusionary girl ones.
Anathema so again.
The intended audience doesn't need a vast amount of space in the crotch.
If you really want to wear girl jeans and have a penis this is why gaffs exist.
I just want jeans that fit.
Google it not on your work pc.
And skip past the fishing equipment.
Measure waist -> 34 inch -> buy 34 inch jeans -> ridiculously too large.
Could fit another person in with me large.
Belts are not going to fix this large.
These jeans I bought also don't have belt loops btw.
They were £8 ok?
Its ok though we are back into shorts weather.
So I have about 6 months before this is an issue again.
Please don't talk to me about shorts.
Anathema this is why you go into stores and try them on before you buy.
It's great fun.
There are people who try to talk to me there.
You can ask them for help.
They're paid to help you.
Yesss Halestorm have a new covers EP.
Only song I recognise is Ride the Lightning though.
Got a link to the track list?
Closing old sublime text tabs found one containing 'Radiant undying f1scal butterfly'.
Pretty sure that's a password for...something.
Damn sneezes that also cause one to bite one's tongue at the side D.
Yes that is certainly a very convincing argument as to why I should do that v.
Lol games journalism.
Why is that opinion controversial?
I am more amused than anything.
If it only was controversial at this point.
My point is entirely too many game journalists appear to be babby casuals.
I could've bought the argument if it hadn't been just been one paragraph summarized as Combat is bad and dull because it's pretty much low effort posting.
Wait a modest non gaudy SR book cover? Amazing.
Anathema finally linked my carcass jack lookup how many chromes i'll need to colour it properly ocme out to like 400. buy 416. Get it in half of that.
Cooked_Auto it must be a trick.
What colours? were you going for?
Two red 4 blue on a blue/green hybrid armor.
Oh 6l? nice.
Or just 6s?
No its 5 link i wanted the final blue in case i ever decide to 6link it and to shove the conc effect in.
So i can swap conc with aoe easy.
What's the second red? reduced mana? strength to spells? oh added fire?
~MoonWolf Cooked_Auto it must be a trick - Collectors Edition book. p.
Anathema fire pen.
For fire resistances.
Are you running flammability too?
MoonWolf you know the change blindness phenomenon that comes up in EGs?
Today I am 4.5 centimetres taller than usual and wearing a triple earring.
Nobody has said anything that I haven't specifically mentioned the heels to.
Zero What are thoooooose? comments? C.
Noelor you'd think people would notice that.
HS raised its european prices euro went up 11%.
Pound went up 30%.
Stop cheering the downfall of your country MairBear.
Can't help it.
Plus it's adding value to those euro's I've still got in a drawer somewhere.
I'm sure your euro profit will be worth it comapred to all those rising prizes.
Fuck yeah I'll be able to get a whole extra McDonalds.
Or half a Hearthstone pack.
Of course this timed itself out.
Noelor you'd think people would notice that.
Also apparently ES Legends came out so it's no longer NDA'd out the butt.
MairBear now i can tell everyone i don't like it!
Now I can tell everyone Eh It's alright I guess.
Still at least there's more than 3 decks right now.
Looked it up on twitter like 1 english stream 33 viewers.
Hafu started streaming it 10 mins ago!
And now I have to swap to someone playing hearthstone again.
Oh Thijs is streaming now.
I don't see a thijs in this list.
Naw he's heroic brawling.
My point being more that I'm jumping stream from deadgame to game sorely needing that expansion pls brode.
Just gimme the cards brode.
Just gimme the cards.
I can't play gwent because they are wiping my progress so its a bit pointless.
Omg this phone sometimes.
Tell you what Discord is at least better on mobile than irc.
This is the best Android irc client I've managed to find.
That's a product of its persistence though.
If I'm logged out by loss of connection or a zealous memory saving process the server still displays what was said when I log back in.
That's just a fundamental difference in approach though.
Irc is a fairly strict protocol and thus can't do late delivery.
Well it could but everyone would have to agree on how to do it.
Discord can just Do it.
And ircv3 was already a massive fight isn't implemented everywhere and all that does is add a few relativly simple additional features.
Discord servers store irc servers simply transfer.
I get it.
Personally i really wish we could make irc a little bit more modern its super robust and has a lot of support but its falling behind in features.
But the world is much more interested in making their own fancy new chat client / site with VC backing and profits.
And emojies that you have to pay.
Well for discord.
If you want to use emojis cross server.
Was going to say.
Wouldn't suprise me if they gave users the ability to buy ones for themselves too.
Its all about monitizing the tiny pixely faces.
Fae adds a new emoji to her server every day exaggeration.
But if they're unique to that server.
Goal for tonight get to mapping replace my ring.
But if you were a moneypayer.
MoonWolf want a Mokou's Embrace?
You could go join another server and regale them with fea emotes.
Anathema no no i really do not.
You got an Enlighten?
Its a gem.
Blame the developers.
Free Lion bars today.
I should have had less biscuits earlier.
No such thing as too many biscuits.
Yeah but remember one of my hobbies is climbing over things!
Overrated hobby anyway.
More biscuits increases the challenge.
Seems like you'd enjoy that.
Rolling over things is just as effective.
Become the katamari you were meant to be.
Urgh bug on deployed site used for integration tests -> take copy of db clone code -> works locally.
Fuck it I'm having chocolate.
Cosmic rays ?
I think I know what's happened.
I need to do lots more steps to replicate to see.
I'm going to assume problems with a fit bit.
In spite of how unlikely that may be.
If you create a user you can't then delete them without triggering the membership synchronisation process.
User gets added to the cache when created with no roles right? but .Roles is null instead of an empty collection.
I am a butt.
Hey at least it was simple.
Yeah but I introduced it yesterday in a fix for not being able to sync unassigned roles in external membership providers.
Okay should probably have been caught in review.
It was caught in the integration tests!
It's just they are new and still flaky so we didn't check they passed.
What is the point of testing.
If you don't check the results.
There is different kinds of testing.
Our unit tests are reliable builds have to pass them.
The integration tests use a system that interacts with the web ui the way a person would it's new and its taken a lot of work to get the tests reliable so we still are not 100% trusting of it.
There's not 100% trusting.
And then there's completely ignoring.
Well they also run seperately so a faily unit test will automatically fail the build but the build can pass and then fail integration tests.
Limitations in the system unfortunatly.
Once they are reliable I'll get email notifications when they fail.
Of course the FT uses 'plebiscite' instead of 'referendum' |.
Only two hours leeeft.
Don't know whats going on but the EU PoE servers seems to be dying.
Amstardam is just gone frankfurt didn't want to give me a character select and london let me load back into my game but then just timed out.
Are they patching?
Gave up well try later.
Well nier hard mode certainly lives up to the name.
First miniboss oneshot me.
1 or automata ?
GlennCuttlefish what difficulty though.
One of the difficulties is just damage = 1 shot regardless.
Thats very hard.
Oh! You said it there. Sorry.
2b must die move ?
Hard mode enemies only do 50% of your health.
I missed that.
Amsterdam frankfurt and london being gone sounds like the opening to a disaster movie.
Guess you need to roll more D.
Or does it also have parry.
Well in really hard mode if any hit kills you you finally have a reason to uninstall your healthbar.
No need for that thing.
Fuck it guess I'll do what I usually have to do in serious platinum games and try normal mode first.
Like the casual scrub I am.
I was never able to dodge this one move from the boss.
Somehow it just seems to reach farther away than I think.
Just parry it.
Channel your inner raiden.
No parry just dodge.
I'm 12 episodes behind in SU how did that happen.
Last one I saw was the end of the zoo arc.
How many am I behind?
Less than me!
Glad I was not more specific then!
MairBear they keep making new ones.
That's an unusual habit.
Well it was a good thing I switched to normal back then.
Thats 30 minutes of prologue and you cant save during it.
Also this game does not have autosaves.
They've been weekly since end of zoo I think.
Oh hey this came with some DLC since its day1 edition or something.
What do you do with a human baby when it starts to glow.
!note Noelor your RT just reminded me that Young Justice is on Amazon Prime Video.
Grmbl the one chip I would really need in this game is locked behind easy mode.
I am terrible at multitasking pad buttons.
Oh boy weapon stories are back.
Go back down on earth. first I jump off a building and lose half my health.
Then I get almost gored to death by an angry moose.
Was fighting robots accidentally shot a boar.
Missed my chance to see if there was boar surfing.
At least as of this point moose wrangling and hog surfing are off the table.
Boar surfing was confirmed in a dev stream.
Start an episode of SU up pop up full frontal nudity....
Giving the shippers what they want.
.... bad MoonWolf.
No interactive meta for you.
I'll just play control priest then.
With n'zoth and that deathrattle quest.
Who can reccomenda better site to watch SU from? ^^.
Hey this one offers more 'ps' and doesn't try to pop up! Seems my problem is solved.
Oh goddamnit not even this game can escape dark souls tier bullshit.
720 of them.
I hate this walk back to your corpse to recover shit craze.
At least it's not without all your gear like some games did a couple of years back.
Looking at you Dungeon Siege 2 >=|.
Have fun jogging through an area with all the monsters respawned and you have none of your gear after you died v.
Gave up on that game after getting to that one bossfight that was almost built to be as obnoxious as possible and use the game itself to fuck with you.
In this case a caster who throws AOEs directly under your party members and will most likely instantly knock on your own casters and kill them repeatedly as the spell will be cast on all members regardless if they are awake or not.
Which means you have to move around constantly and onto that you have to deal with spawned adds a shield that needs to be taken out and when that one is gone him throwing spells that will still knock your healers ass flat in one swipe unless you remember to move away just in time.
So I spent most of that fight without any real DPS as both my healer and combat mage was either unconcious or dead. Fun fucking times. v.
At least D2 let you get your corpse tpd to town by quitting and relaunching... stole your gold of course but that was a meaningless substance anyway.
Yeah but then the dark mage's position was nowhere near one of the waypoints either so you'd still have to hack your way through respawns to get to him. That and the traps.
So I uninstalled that and decided to replay Kingdom of Amalur instead v.
Which also wants to be an MMO but is less obnoxious about things.
Moose wrangling confirmed.
Time to ruin some other nostalgia.
Oh shit I found some kind of majestic albino moose.
Now I cant decide if I should kill it or ride it.
I dont think stabling is a thing so killing would be my pick.
The problem with daytime desert is that while taking a journey there I did in fact loose my moose by setting it loose.
Huh I was wrong apparently there are counters in this.
Ofcourse there is.
Think of who made it.
Oh lordy disguised toast is esportsing at pax.
So of course he yoggs for lethal with kun-aviana-maly druid.
Anathema oh i was going to tell you i'm saving up for a golem build.
Subreddit marginally more insufferable than usual today.
What with the plebs without a shred of understanding of global economics and inflation.
I dont like this.
This nier is entirely too positive in its attitude.
I mean ok the original one was not that bad until you got to the later parts but still.
I am sure it's coming Glenn.
Started thinking how these quests have gone I think I might have too high standards for misery these days.
Its not a happy game by any definition.
Just clocking in to say I'm a dumb idiot.
GlennCuttlefish look just finish 3 endings and then you'll find out that actually every single thing you did was actually the worst possible thing to do.
Just about the worst game of heroes ranked mode right now.
Effective solo queue into 5 stack that was way above their MMR.
Goes for the greediest of dive comps with perfect insane coordination.
Because that is the playerbase at bronze league according to Blizzard.
5 stack bruiser camp invade on other side of the map at level 8? sure why not.
Happened again worse than the last time.
Apparently balanced matchmaking is to put a tri-stack of diamond/masters league v bronze league me.
Well played blizz.
MoonWolf read the commentary on latest EGSNP.
Alright that farce over with.
Surprisingly only landed as low as Silver 1.
And here I was expecting Bronze 5.
Cosmetics and currency regardless so egh.
!note Nolelor OH THANK GOODNESS IT'S OVER.
Standard jade druid in wild. Nope'd out of that fight.
My curiosity to know what wild cards he's got outweighed my creeping despair of having to play vs a jade deck.
MoonWolf how much gold have you amassed in prep for un'goro btw?
Jane Wick pretty much. Still looks pretty good though.
I hate to be that guy in parties but this ninja is doing single target rotation.
Vs 10 mobs.
When 4 mobs is the hard switch for aoe being jsut better.
Great rez macro from the healer though D.
I love those runs of LFR where you zone in on a boss with multiple determination stacks.
And you kill them on your first attempt while there.
I love it when it's the end or one difficult boss.
When it's at the start it can be terrifying.
I'm pretty sure they just sang shake it like me.
MoonWolf I got myself embroiled in some heavy drama.
Serious drama ?
I did not ultimately break up an engagement.
Or run away to New Zealand.
Noelor i am really quite happy that this egsnp thing is over.
I thought you might be.
Did you read the commentary?
Where even Dan's like hoo boy that one went on a bit.
Omg why is this allowed to be real.
The ocean is it even rael.
Somehow i find myself fishing a lot in this game.
Slowly depopulating the horrible ocean.
Thank heavens for that! I was sure you were going to ask for help with yet another one of your irks─ irks...citing quests. -Damn moogles.
Citing quests very important quest where yu have to properly cite your sources for an essay.
If they add a beast tribe that's all about knowledge and books that would believably be a thing.
I wrote down this quote and the page number but not which book I was reading BUT it's definitely in this library.
Of living book monsters*?
Or is there 5 new book emotes that I have to spam at inanimate shelves?
That would be in line with a beast tribe quest.
Godsdamnit Nanamo you're an empress.
You can't do the princess hiding in disguise to mingle with commoners at this point in the plot.
I mean just wear a big enough hat and nobody will recognize her.
Hell just the fact that she is moving around without her perch is probably enough to fool most people.
...raubahn isn't following her right? That might be a bit diffcult to disguise.
Maybe if she took *his* hat and left him somewhere looking for it.
Raubahn is not the sultansworn were all looking for where she'd got to though.
And that's the nostalgia quest done and the best emote in the game unlocked.
Talking of the ocean.
I love the ocean.
Disguised Toast progressing in the PAX major.
Start of today's run bracket shows disqualification.
Twitch loses their shit allegations of rule breaking.
Oh turns out he missed sign up due to DST change in the States.
Willing to bet reddit is loosing its shit right now.
On second thought let's not go to /new/ tis a silly place.
Playing lowest fucking curve paladin class cards deck.
Jade rogue /put eater of secrets in their fucking deck/.
People DO that ?
Are you on wild ?
Nope standard casual.
Also beneath the grounds and full assassinate.
Think double journey below so might not have been reno.
A watched heretic never sins - this inquisitor is determined I give him that.
Will Andromada imprt ME3 saves?
MairBear so he's going to look away ?
No no he's just encouraging himself to be patient.
And it seems that Hildibrand's mother is a Dark Culinarian.
Not actually called that the straight man of this act merely said he had heard of dark knights before but this was something even more heretical.
Gazebo's are quite expensive and dangerous if not domesticated.
NieR a small child makes a pact with a weird demonic book for a cookie.
Just the one.
My enemy found religion.
5 minutes later I have a dozen suicide bombers chasing me.
Here we go playthrough 2.
Do you get to keep your stuff ?
MoonWolf because webcomics the Tedd that is now my profile picture everywhere is from August 2014.
Or two incomic weeks!
I think we're the other side of the weekend.
The other night when playing Civ I mentioned I planted an aqueduct on the opposite side of a river to the city it's carrying water to.
I finally zoomed into the city and it's actually carrying river water upstream.
This is gross Kyoto stop it.
You did this Noelor.
This is your own fault.
Now I feel like researching Sanitation has taken a higher priority.
So we can make sure they at least flush their poo out even further downstream of the aqueducy.
I don't think sewers actually need to be placed but still.
Miracle rogue v dragon priest.
Miracle rogue toying with a raza.
Dragon priest pushes lethal with double leeroy.
Gandhi actually spawned into this game with the secondary agenda Nuke Happy.
And cuaght up with SU for now.
MairBear wanna see a baby coo?
When do I not? D.
At least as long as that's a coo that is a baby.
And not a baby that is cooing.
The hell is a coo.
MoonWolf here's the adult.
You seemed to have typod cow.
MoonWolf they're from scotland.
I don't see what that has to do with it.
That type of cow is a coo.
In the same way a cow from very roughly your neck of the woods is a frisian.
Yeah but we don't just make the name of a type of cow badly spelled cow.
No it's correctly-spelled coo.
It's pronounced differently as well.
Coo are bullshit.
MoonWolf I'm browsing through Krosmaster characters.
It hurts a little.
That one is especially bad.
This is for generatic Panic characters.
Contemplating changing Ogre's Style on Qilby to Ogress Style.
Panic characters make your name a really terrible pun possibly two.
MoonWolf no I'm making Panic characters based on Krosmaster characters because my friend has a bunch of the models.
So we can actually play it with those!
Did uh.
I forget that the new season came out already?
If it did I completely missed it.
Did I link to a video this morning?
Dunno been playing nier all day.
Well just in case.
This game is fantastic.
Will check it once I have audio equipment plugged into my computer again.
Is Krosmaster Wakfu Bloodbowl?
If by that you mean the in-universe sport no that's Boufbowl.
If by that you mean the tactical boardgame based on the IP then yes.
Oh I thought it was a Boufbowl boardgame just based on what little I'd seen an interpreted.
But fair enough!
There's a bunch of different box sets one of them probably has Boufbowl elements.
So i finally got around to playing va-11 hall-a.
And in the cyberpunk bartending future.
Drinks are REALLY expensive.
Oh dear another Fallout ar.
Also that song is now also in all y'all's heads.
Google and YouTube are being a complete butt w/r/t changing my profile pic.
Right thats 5 endings so far.
Coolness poll Akimbo Circle Stance or Akimbo Shuffle Stance?
As in the name?
Literally the same fact.
Hm. so far I think zestiria anime might be better than the actual game. I am just worried about the pacing since they haven't even touched some major plotpoints by episode 16.
Wait what the fuck is Flashy Style.
At the start of your turn you may discard one or two tokens. These may be tokens you hold tokens held by an ally you can see or tokens hed by an enemy within range.
At the end of your turn you may move up to 4 spaces.
5+ Show Off Push any number of enemies you can see 2 spaces.
That seems ridiculous.
Noelor retort.
I forwarded that to Discord.
1010 PM Aithon what a good hipster.
I don't get it.
Meanwhile in Panic chargen I just got to write Bleeding Mountain Stance.
Better caues a lot of burning tokens.
It's actually about iron tokens and refusing to due.
But its called bleeding mountain.
That's not burning mountain though?
A bleed mountain clearly refers to a vulcano.
Ok well in this case it refers to a skeleton person who won't fall down.
Because Styles only have one name.
There is an actual Volcanic Style.
So you could make Volcanic Mountani Stance.
You might not though.
Doesn't seem like a good combo.
Would it let you set people on fire ?
It lets you set the ground on fire.
And maybe set people on fire a little also because you probably have a Flametongue ability if you have that stance.
Don't let me forget this exists for the love of everything.
Ftrbzzs my coffee hasn't been delivered yet I can't cope!
A clear case of fwp? P.
First world problem. I was being facetious if you're wondering.
I can't think with this much caffeine withdrawal.
I managed to almost sleep over getting ready for my weekly unemployment seminar because my phone had managed to brick itself and had to be rebooted. It's getting distressingly common.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish apparently there's a Callback Campaign in ff if your account is offline for 90 days or more a friend can recruit you back with some rewards which are of course greater for the recruiter.
This campaign has no closing date yet. So if you two ever do feel like picking it up in the future I selfishly request the honour of using this system xD.
QQ good coffee arrived literally a few mins after I had a bad one.
Do you get more silver/golden feathers ?
Anathema why are you undercaffienated ?
I get 5 goldens. The returner gets 7-days free time after they pay I think 99 aetheryte tickets and 10 silvers.
And the silvers can now be traded in for 230 gear as well.
The top dungeon is avg 230 entry.
Any mounts involved ?
However it's 5 feathers per thing >.>.
So you can get a total of two items v.
Nevermind fuck that.
Goldens give mounts.
Rather get the cosmetics than.
If its only 2 230's.
MoonWolf was resisting having the bad coffee.
Put it this way it's 1650 tomestones of the easier to get not capped one if you buy the chest and legs.
That isn't that hard to get.
Plus if you're a returning player there is story andungeons you have no done yet.
True just cuts out some tedium.
Anyway if i'm playing again it'll be when there is a good bit of new expansion content to play.
Damn jeff from the overwatch team is going to make my favourite hero lucio more impactfull / less must pick.
Which i can only read as nerfs.
3 dps dead in my group 4 dps dead over other two groups.
Our healers spam dps instead of rezzing v.
I'm finally WINNING in dps MairBear.
If i rez now that other whitemage is going to overtake me.
Also oe of our group.
Mair i'll let you know if I pick it up again.
Right now busy with nier for the next few days at least.
Speaking of which at the point I am at it doesn't really make a difference if I am playing at the hardest oneshot difficulty or not since even on hard I am getting oneshotted.
Maybe I should finally consider equipping some defensive chips.
Such a good game.
Damn right it is.
What are you talking about again?
Do the defensive chips have weapon stories ?
Chip stories ?
Really hope the same link is still on my clipboard.
I'm a goddam bear.
You are 🌙🐺 not 🌙🐻.
The Queen of all Bees Once Exiled now Returned.
Brb making a new lunar character.
I hear she's causing quite the buzz.
Really wish i could emoji my username.
At some point I'll be arsed to upgrade my irc to actually show those v.
They dont moonwolf.
At least not that I have seen so far.
Anyway back to Panic chargen.
GlennCuttlefish the worst.
I'm up to Trickster stances!
Trickster is a weird archetype turns out.
Who would have guessexc.
It's very defensive.
I was expecting it to be mobile but it's mostly more interested in pushing opponents though a couple of the styles have teleport so it's not like they're stationary.
Just three archetypes left then stances for the frantics.
And then I get to format them all ~.
Also having done all this I feel like Fused heroes are probably the easiest to make?
Somethng something cheap tactic.
MoonWolf no no.
They really don't need it.
Like the focus of Focused heroes is actually pretty constrictive if you're trying to make a good character.
Just being able to dip out for one form is great.
Like you have a Flametongue and they're quite good at burning things and have that recovery option.
But if you fuse to another archetype suddenly you can pick up real mobility options.
Okay is it NOW safe to put the game back on hard? I can deal with my own incompetence but when the game puts limitations on me its time to tune down the difficulty.
Or my Focused Trickster vanilla Rogues are reliant on throwing enemies into things for their damage stance.
Whereas Remington who is a Fused Gunkata/Trickster can instead shoot people full of holes.
While having much better defences than the Focused Gunkata cra characters.
I don't normally complain about busted draws.
But this mage is insane.
Top decks flamestrike two turns in a row in first 11 cards drawn.
Don't you though?
Much worse than usual.
Oh and they finished up with activated CT 2 draws later.
Yeah RIP you.
Well I now have no idea of what will happen in zestiria anime.
Because nothing like this happened in the game.
I think we should get St George's Day as a holiday too it is difficult working here sometimes.
Doesn't sound that hard to me.
Without offending people by calling them idiots I mean.
A real struggle.
Just compromise and have a day when their cubicle is filled with snakes.
GlennCuttlefish we don't have cubicles.
Or it wouldn't be a problem.
Someone mentioned My Little Pony.
And that show's theme tune was such an effective earworm it's immediately looping in my head.
The credits are probably the best thing v.
Route C is really making me miss checkpoints.
Has it turned out that everything you did was terrible yet ?
Well that would be spoiling things.
But think about it this way I am playing nier.
How long have transports been active again? I've been running everywhere manually through C path so far.
Aww yeah finally got my chocobirb ranked up enough to reach the transmog endgame.
MairBear at least you don't dress up as chocolina.
So erm turns out 90's saturday morning kids tv is pretty bad.
GlennCuttlefish you really shoulda told me blm was this fun.
I tried telling you mair but you only heard the words not the meaning.
It helps that PotD lets me play anything at 60 so I don't have to go through the rigamarole to try it.
I'm glad I am a compulsive saver in games while playing nier.
Watching a stream on the side and the streamer just lost a hours progress because he did not save.
There is an evil Yugo called Kivin.
Hm the R20 servers seems to be hiccuping with far more frequency.
Moonwolf cant entirely blame them since the reason he died is bullshit of a highest degree.
Noelor no goatee can't be that evil.
As I said more edgy than evil.
I guess what Cooked_Auto said.
Though also they are too young for goatees.
But he's not a direct evil twin though spawned from some curse or magic so obviously he cant have a goatee.
Final stage of first pass chargen for Panic.
Picking forms for the frantic heroes.
First pass at actual presentation of these characters will likely go through this and add some level of colour formatting as well.
Would defs appreciate !notes with any advice or feedback if anyone gets a chance to look at that overnight or in the AM.
But with that accomplished g'night.
Oh god D.
Omg he has a sculpted moustache beard and top-hat.
Ok I want them.
How much is one ?
Anathema what's the plans for DW?
First session probs next week was gonna be tonight but suddenly going to Wales tomorrow morning and I gotta pack and stuff tonight.
Then weekly? Or fortnightly?
I'm being asked what my availability is for something else Wednesday-based.
Was thinking fortnightly.
Cael hwyl yng Nghymru.
According to Google Translate.
Have fun in Wales.
This is genius.
Really tough zombies + they explode on low life + a belt that makes your flasks apply to your zombies + a flask that sets your life to 1.
Does that not undo the tough?
Or do you mean as in deadly?
They need to have lots of health because the explosion damage is based on their health.
And that's applied before the 1HP?
Yeah max hp not current.
For some reason read it as changing max to 1.
So what you're telling me is PoE has Danger Mario builds?
Anathema that gameplay looks really awkward though.
I love that it's a thing though!
Yeah that sounds like a Danger Mario build alright.
Danger mario ?
I was wondering how they would top first niers final ending. now I know. But that will have to wait for a while more.
Danger Mario is a build from the first two Paper Mario games.
In those games you mostly affect your build by wearing Badges which grant you additional active or passive powers.
And there's a set of badges all with Danger in their name which activate only when Mario is depending on which game/badge on 1 or <5 Hp.
The main ones being a massive boost to dodge rate and to attack power.
Man the original paper mario was such a good game.
This is more like if mario made his little companion blow up by throwing them at the enemy.
The wii one was so fuckign disappointment.
Anathema the WiiU one is real good.
Nier please this race is bullshit.
I have to race this guy over a huge chasm and they can fly.
Intall a flying hcip.
Make you rlittle robot dude do it.
2B is decidedly a gynoid.
You get a nier 1 style book but its not a book its a flying robot buddy.
Though note I'm experiencing NieR for the first time through the Chaos Crew streams.
Which I'm hoping will be weekly.
Well nier gets a magic books. sorry i spoiled that.
It's in the prologue bit.
I'm not surprised that it'll return =P.
You get a nier 1 style book but its not a book its a flying robot buddy <- unless you are day 1 master race.
You get a weiss skin for it.
Weiss as in???
The name of said book.
All I can think of is RWBY.
Anathema my main gems are rolled to 20 time to 20 quality em all.
Anathema so there's one character I haven't unlocked in Necrodancer I looked into it. Apparently it combines 3 character's restrictions into one. The monk you cannot touch gold or you die and bosses minions drop it shops are free. 'Bolt' the beat speed is doubled. And Aria the only-allowed knife die in one hit or missing a beat character.
And unlike Aria this character doesn't start with the potion that gives you an extra life.
Sounds like an anathema sort of character.
Sounds like RSI before the first floor D.
Noelor you'll like this part Her name is Coda being the concluding segment in a musical piece. And also Italian for 'tail' because she uses her tail to wield a dagger.
MairBear have fun with that!
MoonWolf this is why people want Eyes of the Greatwolf.
Oh thats a lot of damage.
46k people are watching power rangers on twitch.
What a world.
I don't understand but I don't complain.
Jump rope's a sport now?
Was expecting photos of IRL people wearing that latex tan colour t-rex outfit doing sport though.
MoonWolf is 46k more than bob ross?
I don't remember.
Global wild cat conservation organization Panthera hang on.
Anyone want 80 mutual hearthstone friendship gold?
MoonWolf did you have a look at my Panic sheet btw?
Sorry i have not yet.
BwaS could do with that.
Accidentally clicked trending not on twitter top is #pmqs with.
Jeremy Corbyn somehow missed an open goal at PMQs.
He supports arsenal it goes with the colours.
Corbyn is really bad at being opposition.
See thing goverment does.
Tell everyone that its dumb and bad.
And then try very hard to stop them.
He's very good at alienating people who should be his allies.
That whole 'vote for A50 bill whip party to do so kick from shadow cabinet if vote against'.
Followed by 'protest measures of A50 bill we voted for'.
Gotta love that.
Remember when he was the messiah though?
You don't get to stay messiah if you don't you know follow through on the whole thing.
Insufficient Rapture 4/10.
Imagine if jesus got himself annointed made some grand promises and then went and started promoting traditional pharisee doctrine.
That one was my own fault tbf.
I tapped yes to the weekly cache clean-up prompt.
And that lagged your phone to hell.
And obviously current chat session is saved in this app's cache.
Oh or that.
That makes some sense too.
What app is this even ?
Voting has occured.
You did a democracy!
Democracy or riot.
May the one who got the most votes win!
But only if that's the one we truly want.
MairBear actually how our democracy works.
But win is relative.
Since none will have an outright majority.
And there's that geert wilders something or other over there.
So it's taken me 4 months. But I'm finally working on uploading my holiday pictures.
Oh boy this boss is on some steroids. figured I'd level to 99 just in case.
Still getting oneshotted.
Wow. switched gear to full defense.
Cant parry bullets.
Or whatever that thing is shooting.
Shoot the bullets.
Not the type you can shoot.
I did win in the end by lucking out and the boss not using that pattern.
After 60 hours I finally found something I actually factually hate in this game.
So there is this traveling vendor right.
Who from what I understand has different inventory depending where they spawn.
But I have never in my 60 hours seen them spawn at the location that sells weapons.
Guess what 2 weapons I am missing?
In fact the asshole has been permacamping the desert entrance for a while now.
And you need all weapons for an ending.
Because yoko taro.
Ok plan b since it is a traveling vendor I am just going to sit right here and fish for however long it takes for them to travel here.
Catching them meese.
How many fish do you need to unlock the relevant fish ending?
Err. only fish ending I know of 0.
Wow. So casual.
However you have to fish up at least one weapon.
After playing this game through the proper endings I think I have all of those I still am not sure how I should feel about this statement.
So the game has a system where you can pray for dead players and either summon an AI from their corpse or get random buffs.
Corpses are usually found where they died.
The boss room I had some trouble with earlier.
Guys something very upsetting has happened.
This phone does not loop Megalovania seamlessly like my old one did.
It adds a longer pause.
Noelor the worst.
I thought you quitting IRC was taking our advice.
And then in the next 20 mins getting a better looping phone.
Aww man fallen in love with Probius login screen.
Too bad the whole 15k first fortnight thing otherwise he'd be an instabuy.
Even if I do play Terran.
Omg Final Fantasy Boybands has baby chocos that are chicken size.
Took a break. come back. this anorexic fuckhead on their sufferscooter keeps tormenting me.
The what in who what now???
There's a traveling vendor in nier automata who spawns in a random location.
I've been trying to get them to spawn in a specific location since their inventory is location specific.
And those are the last ¤#!%#!% bloody weapons I need.
Hate owning the overwatchers in heroes yet never having them on the daily quest rotation.
Oh wow a rare case of mythic+ weekly cache dropping a gear upgrade for once.
And interestingly drops as an item that doesn't support mythic+ yet.
Pro click indeed.
GlennCuttlefish MoonWolf.
I don't even.
We take defence you take offence just pretend it's a good old game of CTF you know we're terrible at CTF right? oh I've missed red vs blue.
MoonWolf I had to stat up a minotor sic with a wrecking ball.
So it has the Bleeding Dragon Stance ie the combo Gnome put at the centre of Saitama's frantic build.
But Deminoball is instead a Focused Punk instead.
Minotaurs don't seem like they would be punks.
Punk is just.
The be tough more threatening the less health you have.
Yeah but words mean things and punk and minotaur. don't in my head fall in the same rough categories.
I mean fair.
I dunno MoonWolf I reckon Punk Minotaur would lay down some sweet riff lines.
RIP Dropbox public folder v.
I'll miss it.
I kinda will since I used it for temp stuff and disliked having to load up DBs UI for image links.
I switched my screenshot uplaoder to imgur now.
I might go back again.
Even if I do enjoy making filename jokes occasionally.
Rip glenns filenames.
Wait what happened to the public folder.
You can no longer directly link to dropbox files in a public folder.
You now always have to share this file through dropbox.
<- so this is now your links.
Rip your filenames.
Whose fault is this.
Dropbox's pretty much.
Wants everyone to use their website.
They claim this is somehow better for us.
It wants to have more server errors like imgur.
Well time to find a better alternative then.
Imgur I guess.
Imgur works as long as you don't need things in a specific order.... D.
And have a number where it's tedious to manually rearrange like with these holiday pictures x.x.
Because apparently auto-sort is so last decade.
!note anathema Had to devastate my currency tab by cashing most of it in back into chaos but finally got the last expensive golem build jewel.
Random at the randoms again >C Tavern braaaawl.
Wait wahaaaaaaaat first the board gets flooded with party crashers. Then I get an Un'goro pack. available mid april.
Also wtf bliz you can't change new years day this often.
Sure they can.
Finished up focused heroes plus a couple fused.
Holy shit adding the colours to this formatting helped sooo much.
With legibility and helping me spot weird line breaks.
Have no idea how I'll print these now of course.
MoonWolf> yeah saw that one.
Gotta say tavern brawling for a pack I can't open yet pretty harsh blizz.
Randombrawling no less.
And I thought brawling the tavern for a card back and no pack was rough.
1st attempt warlock lines up activated bane of doom into a 7 drop.
2nd attempt mage coins out activated kazakus.
Ok nier explain to me Mankind fucked off to the moon who knows how long ago.
Oh and a skeleton knight eating a snipe then winning the joust.
The earth has been sitting there pristine forever.
Fun Interactive.
Why for what reason is pure water easily the rarest resource in this place?
Why did we emigrate to Yoko Taro's face?
Don't actually want spoilers.
We fucked off to the moon as earth was no longer pristine?
Not a spoiler thats the premise of the whole game.
Maybe the aliens also the water somehow.
I mean sure they have clunky robots but still this is ridiculous.
Yeah I was just staving off further details.
MairBear I'm listening to Undertale remixes right now and that fits perfectly.
Actually speaking of robots why do I need pure water to upgrade my gun.
Well you wouldn't want to fill your gun up with impure water.
Please dont require more water for the next upgrade.
Thought I was watching next season of RvB.
This episode appears to just be the Yellow trailer off Rwby.
!note noelor.
Trying to decide if it's worth it to get vba to handle special characters.
Hard to say without more information.
I mean the answer is no.
Because I can just replace the characters with text strings.
I take back what I said yesterday.
Fresh water is not the rarest resource in this world.
In the world filled with robots gears are the rarest thing. ok the game calls it a gadget but look at it its gears.
They're basically organs at that point right?
MoonWolf 100% yes to that edit.
Yes? I am saying this is as ridiculous as not finding buzzard gizzards in 50 buzzards.
Because in fact you cant even find those things in enemies.
You have to find them at gathering points.
Mine for gears.
At this point I am cradlerobbing for gears since for some reason one has a chance to spawn there and its near to a savepoint.
..get to the next step.
I require even rarer gadgets.
Well that explains that.
So I was going through what I am missing in this game. after finishing the game a few times I am still missing some tutorials.
LPGBTQ Zone nice.
Too many letters.
The P is for Play.
It is an joke.
Isn't it a joke.
Kinkshame autocorrect to milkshake.
Not even close.
At least it's not the other way round.
My kinkshame brings all the boys to the yard.
We'd get boys being brought - ues.
Cooked_Auto delicious mimic?
IIIIIIII just fucked up my code by typing colour.
Hm. guess its time for some maintenance again.
Noelor done that before myself.
Discord is a good time.
Yes that works.
Custom emotes is great in this case one of my discord servers have a bunch.

These characters are the same class.
I feel like that is an extreme version of a male sram. dont they usually resemble guys in skeleton pyjamas more.
Ok technically that's Dofus rather than Wakfu.
Wakfu Sram.
Krosmaster Sram meanwhile.
Now do a krosmaga one.
The one lady Sram in Krosmaster.
Not a fan of the krosmaster designs.
I think this is the original god Sram?
GlennCuttlefish this is the actual model.
Is there an actual figurine version of that game or..?
Yeah that's the figurine line.
A friend has a bunch of them and it's what we're going to use to play Panic at the Dojo.
Which is why I've been around finding images and checking out the various games' pages.
For pics adjectives to go on.
WIP finishing it up tonight as I type.
Oh hey some Rayearth.
Oh no a squank!
Xelor have also changed a lot turns out.
Noelor> Theresa May from 026 in this video clip.
Uggggh do I have to care rn?
Not really in your own time.
Panic at the Wakfu writeup finally finished! \o/.
Seems I really missed a phase of power rangers in its early run.
When the fuck did they replace the cast with alan rickman's character from galaxy quest.
Goddamnit yoko taro.
BwaS what's really stupid is I welled up a bit just *reading the article about the plans* for the Queen's funeral that you RT'd.
I mean it shouldn't be.
But yeah I don't disbelieve she's all that's holding the country together rn.
They finally made it to Zeo.
Turns out there's actually a rationale and a logic behind the Megazord I had as a kid and how you stuck it together.
Pink Yellow total slackers.
The least competant mercy.
But am i wrong though.
...well done.
They had to one up sony by adding colourful lights?
Well yeah they don't have to be realistic.
Honestly the crouching mount at the start was what sold it to me.
!note Noelor The most unsightly of squanks.
In all my days of playing yakuza nothing strikes fear into me more than those guys standing around the streets wearing green shirts or yellow raincoats.
They dont even fight you.
Oh no. If you accidentally bump into them they force a tissue into your inventory.
Yakuza why are you this way.
Also in todays episode of yakuza 2 I am going to be the top host even if it kills me.
MoonWolf 2/3 confirmed players have expressed interest in the punk minotor so =I.
I may start calling people that.
..what even is a squank.
GlennCuttlefish an anime who can't swear wanted to agree that someone is a skank.
Noelor the real question is wtf was the original japanese.
So now we have the word squank.
MoonWolf that way only madness lies my friend.
And yet curiousity compells me.
Continuing my spree of classic coding errors.
Why the shit isn't this working.
30 minutes later oh I added this line to help me debug and forgot to reverse it afterwards.
I remember back in wow plugin days where i had no debugger.
My code would just get littered with print statements.
Anytime i had a hard to track down problem.
I am perfectly fine with Monopoly T-Rex.
Cooked_Auto it won't stop it from being a shit game.
But at least you can be a t-rex.
Monopoly is awful.
But still t-rex.
MairBear BwaS hs card stuff for next expansion.
But not now apparantly.
Watch that space.
How cunning. air it to clash with the trinity series stream.
Don't really care trinity has been really boring to me.
I'll watch the finals.
Yeah finals this wknd 2nd day of 3 now grand final tomorrow.
Sorry thats what i meant.
The actualy final match.
D9 supposedly starting in an hour.
I got excited because i saw his stream go live.
And i was like i must have been off on the time.
Fucking america and its strange DST transitions.
Tbh I do agree with you a bit.
Not much entertainment in 3 russians mumbling on the merits of tunnel trogg v coin totem golem t1 opener as the fuse goes off.
MoonWolf there are no DST transitions that aren't awful.
The whole concept can go fuck a fugu.
!note Noelor it'd be slightly better if we all did it at the same time. instead of some countries going earlier/later.
Stream wwait screen goes away music stops. casters come on screen their mouths move. no sound comes out.
I don't even get that much.
What is this the playhearthstone stream.
Well... .thats a card.
180843 * /@Dude Not connected to a server line 53 thememanager.ini.
Well ofc it's epic.
From the makers of renounce darkness and the people who take 90 seconds to play aech turn.
Comes a card to turn your whole deck into a discover brawl.
Miracle warrior... gotta love the way devs play the game in their internal meta.
Boring but good 4 mana is not something that priests needs to fill. where are the 1/2 drops.
More discard loc.
HS finally introducing non minion based effects.
Here's this amazing card for priest! we're trashing dragon priest twilight guardian's going n'zoth priest will be your option here's an infested tauren that doesn't simply die.
I keep trying to make handbuff paladin work yeah... *dev awkwardness*.
The senjin felhound is one thing but we all know the two cards it will be discarding are your two doomguards.
Thats why you also play the if you discard you draw minion.
Okay i'm making a wild secret mage.
Please play avian watcher please!
Evidently sean you run grand crusader double to find mysterious to play your secrets for you.
But also electric pressure cooker can do the same but also rice cooking and pressure cooking.
190854 but is more complex.
Damn copy paste is bad.
<- shuffle 5 bad cards into your deck ?
Add 40 dust to your hand!
Going in a wild deck with other Elise and Malch.
Remember the eat a murloc crab.
Now there is a eat a pirate crab.
And it's beast so gives hunter an edge on pirates?
Bye bye audio again.
High production quality stream.
Brode's hacking in to the mainframe Sean's asking too many questions cut the feed!
Great gotta love losing to those paladins who drop three blessings of kings on a single dude token.
Han'on isn't bronotosaurus not an actual dinosaur...
Oh there's the token Rager card. ding ding ding.
I wanna see that hunter legendary v Jaraxxus.
Srsly less than a month out and it's still release date early april.
D9 with his whole I think up a new deck schtick and play it 3 hrs then upload the vod delete the deck never touch archetype again.
Plus the whole be a better gamer I love the community in my twitch chat we're so nice to eachother subscriber only.
Turns out people are nice to me when they pay $5 a month.
BwaS i'll take sub only chat over unwashed twitch masses chat ?
Sure but don't say there's an unrelated reason why everyone's nice to eachother and not protecting an investment.
People like Hotform have a nice chat by just moderating the outliers.
And you know on screen being a calm dude and not someone who provokes babyrage spam etc.
Cool back to the Heroes 'every map is single lane'/'fast feed only here for games not wins' meta.
So I'm playing the post-tutorial pre-pvp 'campaign' of that Eternal game...
And it feels pretty... bad. Huge deck size means that one player just snowballs out of control or you both sit with a field of minions never attacking unless you have flight and the opponent doesn't.
Reminding me yet again why I like persistent health in my card games.
Eternal game ?
Eternal Card Game. A few streamers have been cutting it into their streaming when HS proves too maddening for them.
One of the other digital ccg's floating around at the moment next to duelyst gwent shadowverse.
Man i looked at shadowverse.
But it has that creepy quality where its the sort of game where i'm playing i don't want anyone to look at my screen.
They went way to far up the half naked chicks alley.
Eternal has good art and animations. Not like the washed out colours of Elder Scrolls Legends but it lacks entirely in sound. Every card sounds the same no audio cue or voice line.
I keep seeing Shadowverse trolling whenever I trawl the Hearthstone general on /vg/ for art.
When I was in Tokyo there was a lot of people playing shadowverse on the trains.
Really took off there as a mobile game of choice.
I'm not playing that game in public.
Oh and Eternal's mana system is a bastard between HS and MtG.
You play cards max 1 per turn to raise your max mana. But they vanish after that not stay on board like a permanent.
So you can get totally fucked by just drawing minons and no mana or vice versa D!
MTG seems to think so!
At least the enemy can't target your permanents at least not that I've yet seen.
Like the more I play of Eternal the more I see the cards and I love the design of them. It's the mechanics that are flawed. MTG mana minions fully healing if not killed in one turn coupled with the mtg style of defender declaring where your attacks go.
But all the keywords and special things are pretty fun sounding D.
I knew Turbo had some issues.
But apparently Pink Ranger twists her ankle on a train track.
Taking her out of the fight.
I never got into power rangers. Is it actually good or bad in entertaining sort of way without nostalgia goggles.
Well its tokatsu so its bound to look cheesy as fuck.
Maybe a bit of the so bad it's good.
There's a lot of ham and camp going around.
Maybe I will give it a look after I am done watching my one current IRL show.
Well they just had robocop from space arrive in.
Who gets an oversized police car that looks like it was blatantly recorded with an RC toy.
Which then transforms into a bipedal mecha looking just like its pilot.
Make of it what you will.
A friend on FB.
I just don't see what's so emotive about a ladder though.
So now I'm listening to Snake Eater.
BwaS MairBear btw LoveButts got a new Overwatch account to pitch their MMR and not have to share with their fiancé so if you get a weird friend request that's probably who it is.
I might have declined it.
Are you consorting with smurfs now.
How low will you people go.
Oh yeah half life was not the only process I had that started with H when I was blindly shutting down programs.
I really need to pay attention more often.
Do a double take on rwby when was voiced by Vic Mognagna?
Oh turns out ever since they first started appearing in the show.
Evidently I will forget this and have the stumbling block again on the credits in a later season.
TIL there is stardew valley fanfiction. suprising amounts of it.
Like *actually* surprising or?
Because I'd expect plenty.
300 or so entries on AOOO and 107 on fanfiction.net.
The game barely has a story.
The hell are these people writing about ?
Many of these are over 100k words.
Because that's what fanfic writers actually stick to anyway not story.
People really like Shane Sebastian and Elliot.
According to this.
And suprisingly most of tihs is straight instead of m/m.
Yeah ok that *is* surprising.
Ive seen Stardew Valley smut so there being fanfiction as well does not surprise me the slightest p.
101621 › ~MoonWolf 300 or so entries on AOOO and 107 on fanfiction.net - Pretty sure the unique numbers are a bit lower because these tend to get crossposted a lot of the time.
Sure but i'm not cross referencing that shit.
Never expected you to.
Context and acknowledging shortcomings are an important part of statistical analysis!
That's... kinda amazing.
MoonWolf Crash Course are doing a series on mythology rn.
Today I finally learned the actual story of the Enuma Elish.
Probably watch that when they have more up.
Ft Ea and Tiamat.
Timestamp for Enuma Elish.
Noelor this pantheon really really likes randomly creating monsters and or overthrowing eachother.
Like a lot.
Yeah they're great.
Go to a dead in in ff boybands find an ancient dragon tooth treasure... not sure if that's a rare item a sign of dragons up ahead or both.
Sign of rare dragons up ahead.
MoonWolf that looks like a Dark Souls message.
It does yeah.
Not enough talk about lick but hole.
Can't forget 'great chest up ahead.
Or the somewhat hard to get ds2 memories of merchant.
And now there was a friendship bracelet in the next dead end.
Am I going to befriend this dragon?
Yes but in an anime sort of way.
But given Ignis' cooking skills it could be one of those animes. Where he makes some food for it and then it turns out it was just hunger-cranky.
Did he have another idea for a ressipayy?
He's not for a while but then driders and imps don't make a good stew I guess.
You are clearly not reading the right manga.
Was that even a manga? or just an ero-game that somehow got anime'd.
And its done. Nier automata platinum'd and finished.
Even if I did kinda cheat and buy one trophy that required me to idle for a hour from the shop.
What is this? A wow Mythic?
Playing FF15 killed a boss went outside the dungeon getting bodied by a pack of normal mobs.
Well successfully made Japan such a popular tourist destination that I took over the world somehow.
Just like real life.
Let's go for a drive together follow me but don't tailgate. - NPC in ff quest. Objective pops up. Follow the NPC or THE GAME WILL END.
I followed him we're at a gas station we spent the night now I can free roam again. Nothing of note happened no calamitous road collapsing into the abyss behind me.
Hah. No no.
Though I did unlock the last wing of the 8 man raids last night.
And to avoid spoilers as to what and how if I fail it will in lore be the end of the world probably.
Woo managed to move my computer without anything exploding.
I started a new game as China.
Oh neat the next continent is super nearby.
*immediately meets England there* Shiiiit.
The English or at least Victoria do not like people from other continents.
And who can blame them.
Also it turns out when I built my Holy Site in an auspicious valley between two mountains I was also building on an iron deposit.
So now my capital temple is also a mine.
Pollution for everyone.
5 wins questing as hunter. 1 of them only came from opponent playing abysmally with a poorly thought-out deck. 2 of them from opponent fusing out and quitting.
Sure is fun when new class cards reliant on hand size greater than zero in a class with zero card draw.
I see they made Couerls absolutely terrifying again.
High damage aoe that does more than my whole parties hp and an instant kill attack they spam and a stunning pounce. And if by some miracle you do damage them they sprint away lie down and regen very quickly.
If you attack while they are lying down? Insta kill.
No dodge or counter.
They instakill you that is.
MoonWolf Fae played Dragon Lore 2 as promised.
It was so bad it wasn't even entertaining after an hour and a half.
Now Organ Trail is happening.
So bad its not even good anymore.
Which is Oregan Trail but with zombies I think?
I'm watching a hs tournament.
Played nearly 2hrs of Overwatch Arcade loot box grind.
Only 2 wins total.
Oh no SU this week.
If there's one thing that's really frustrated me through trinity series it's MrYagut's accent and verbal tics.
And his team conveniently makes the full final.
They nerfed BLM enough as is.
They did c.
It's like they don't want one class doing more damage than the group combined.
That story really frustrates me.
One kid steals their stuff the other kid gets justifiably upset and is reprimanded for it.
Numbani defence. blue team already locked in double hanzo. roll hanzo as well because fuck the blue team. end up winning.
GlennCuttlefish <- managed to stand in leylines for whole duration not realistic.
0/10 was probably using hacks.
I think this NIN is an overwatch player.
Oh boy oh boy new black mage class quest.
What did I unlock!
Oh! I'ts that one spell that literally never gets used EVER! Yay!
The ground targeted 3 second cast small damage root.
Oh yeah that thing.
The spell I forgot about.
Because I never used it.
Well I did use it because it looks pretty.
But never in combat.
If the ground targeting didn't add time it would -JUST- come out ahead of blizzard II in combat.
But if I've unlocked freeze why would i be using blizzard 2.
Why not just blizz 3 and quickly get back to fire 2 spam.
Man what if you could apply colour modifiers to the catmoji though.
Do we really need that in our lives ?
Nay say I.
The future is in smug anime stickers.
What if we could colour modify the poop emoji.
I didn't know how much I did not want this. But now I do.
Your delegate to Tomyris' court Changying learned that Tomyris received a foreign delegation. The delegation was from China.
Very diligent. you should reward them.
He wants to feel useful.
Sure is something wrong with tavern brawl when the figured out meta is play hunter be on the coin coin hero power hero power every turn do nothing else.
Maybe taunt warrior can be good ?
When the GM uses the Dire template on something unexpected.
Not enough spikes.
It can shoot those feathers though.
Watching bbc drama on iplayer first minute sure I recognise this guy.
Imdb short filmography... oh right fucking pride prejudice and zombies.
I want one D8.
MairBear I am going to need an explanation for these shenanigans.
The mog trains a coming.
So here I was checking what is coming up next season in anime.
The project anthropomorphizes rice kome in Japanese into schoolboys.
MoonWolf got an ancient reliquery key woo.
Anathema lucky bastard.
I have like 5 times your play time.
And i have shit all for keys.
Anathema what was in it ? or are you selling it.
Noelor this fea stream has an interesting playlist >.>.
Because TeamFrogNugget were left in charge of it.
3/4 party are black mage.
This will be a short run D.
MoonWolf being able to log into twitch chat via irc and therefore being able to fullscreen it.
Is a serious consideration.
Its what i do.
MoonWolf I'm saying I do it.
And it's significantly increased twitch's standing.
I use twitch by not using twitch at all.
I watch it through vlc and i chat through irc.
Oh I hadn't considered VLC.
That's a good shout.
You'll need to do so.
And might want streamlink twitch gui.
Because thats a command line tool.
Don't you love it when you're watching some show and jokingly tag one character with death flag only for them to end up dead an episode later?
I think I need either a new mousemat or a new mouse.
Whats wrong with it/them.
My cursor is just weirdly awkward to move sometimes.
Checked for hair/dust on the laser ?
Going to try using my softcover moleskine as a mat see if that helps.
If so probably the mat's fault.
I just use my desk.
I'd have to dust more >.>.
Also I have a wrist support that is designed to go under a mat.
To keep it in place or whatevs.
And is not itself a good mat.
A slightly better reason imho.
Oh geez why did I make the focused punks this powerful.
Well now this is fantastic. website I follow from student days for lighthearted campus drama reporting. now taking sponsored fearmongering posts from the police.
Just an onamatopoeia.
For like an exasperated sigh.
Oh you island people and your police state.
He said while going back to self censoring facebook posts.
Session prep for Panic hella better than Exalted I tell you what.
BwaS MoonWolf.
What have I told you about snooping around r-customhearthstone.
Sometimes it's gold? But usually it's as interesting as the current meta?
' HAPPY SAD HEADCANON DAY.
Which part of that is headcanon.
Oh wait no it portrays mercy as a good person that part.
Except that Blizzard has confirmed she isn't evil v.
We can pretend Metzen confirmed it.
And then it can be rewritten conveniently! D.
Immortal Demon Soul etc etc.
Creates abominations unto god.
Lets look at the evidence.
Reaper her fault.
Genji her fault.
Ana kinda indirectly but still her fault.
Probably her faul.
Oh you havent seen anything yet.
There was also WM as Quiet but not as fun as the others.
I did not need that internet i did not.
They are amazingly good at making random noises in these.
Should also be watched just for the really adorable noises that Pharah's VA does.
Beware the mating call of the Sombra.
Man I love the dumb plots in yakuza games.
Its like you take dumb soap opera plots and then season it with the japanese mafia.
GlennCuttlefish someones long lost twin came back from a world cruise and is now hitting on someone else girlfriend who is working for the local bar which is about to shut down ?
MoonWolf you would be amazed how much of that actually happened.
So here I am practising coloring on random pictures i find in my folder.
As you do.
I've been looking at this picture for a few minutes and it just dawned on me how horribly deformed this character is. and now the picture is ruined forever.
Yeah hate it when that happens.
Panic at the Wakfu episode 1 outline Introduce your characters through boasting about yourselves at the bar. Okay now the bar is full of tofus trying to wreck everything. Fight them and also the Osamodas commanding then.
What is a tofu ?
The small yellow birbs.
Have PC's been made yet ?
Players have chosen Deminoball Drop Knight Chrissy Entrench and Coa Gulary.
Which is not a bad team if lacking in direct support roles.
Coa Gulary <- kill me.
I mean check the Rogues tbh.
At least it wasnt Drop Tables.
Auuuugh Noelor I'm looking for a word but drawing a blank. Sort of like hopeful and optimisitic that a thing will be done.
But still could just be hopes and empty unfulfilled dreams.
1 Hour of Dark Fantasy Country Music youtube_recommended.jpg.
Learn about new genres every day.
This is fascinating reading if anything.
Lol wat.
Cooked_Auto what game even is tihs ?
Monte Cook's Invisible Sun.
Invisible Sun is just insane. It's very backwards in some areas but forward thinking in others. The sole task resolution mechanic in the game is doing tarot readings so they're creating a phone app to do tarot readings on the fly because they want you playing the game even when you're not at the table.
You knwo what gamers love ? lots stuf fin their game. so we made a game thats nothing but additional stuff.
I think that whole bundle is at the 200 dollar backer level or something someone just linked it in FF.
I would just like to point out that Invisible Sun apparently has 750 spells 450 of which are clearly just the usual cypher one-shot doodads.
But this time you have to read tarot cards to cast them!
With a phone app.
That sort of cuts all the mystery our interest out of it.
Might as well just roll dice again.
What is the game actually about?
I dont think that has been clearly mentioend for all I know.
Last time I checked it was nothing but insanely vague promises.
These are all player characters in the Invisible Sun tabletop RPG. They are no longer trapped in Shadow—where you are right now—but inhabit the Actuality a world that seems like a surreal dream to those of us toiling aimlessly in the boring grey realm that we falsely believe is the real world. *projectile vomits*.
But nothing like what you’ve seen before. Invisible Sun makes magic magical again. Magic’s not just a series of mechanics. It’s weird wonderful unpredictable and dangerous. With spells and incantations like The Flock Scatters at the Sound of Teeth Sharp Edges in the First Frost and The Punishment of Change Comes to the Wary magic is what the game is all about. hööörk.
Oh wait the Black Cube is apparently if you pledge $539 v.
Good lord the writing is just so insufferable at parts.
Well thanks to this discussion I now have barbarian rainbow and barbarian pilot in my google history.
The meandering description reminded me of a scene in korgoth of barbaria.
Just couldn't remember the name.
People who search of korgoth of barbaria also searched for Cheyenne Cinnamon and the Fantabulous Unicorn of Sugar Town Candy Fudge.
It actually does both are failed adult swim pilots.
A few cards have been released for the new hs expansion but i wish to highlight the best one.
Look at it.
LOOK A IT.
Loving the reaction to the new priest deathrattle though.
GlennCuttlefish started watching an LP of Nier Autobots and so far its being very Nier one with the robots vis a vis nier 1 and Shades.
...its out on pc.
You have no excuses.
Go play it.
Fuck this lp.
I hear the port is a bit bad in places so might want to pirate it first just to be careful.
So GlennCuttlefishi was totally playing Nier autobots on pc and its being very shades with the robots.
So i go to my favourite torrent indexer.
And i type in nier automata.
And the first result is ManyVids 2B Of NieR Automata POV Face Fucked - Lana Rain Nier Automata.
Has porn gone too far ?
No. why would you even say that.
Actually not sure its even cracked yet if it uses denuvo.
Also how do you mean with shades and robots.
I really didn't find them to be the same.
Ooh the robots are being all weird and pretending to be HUUUMAAAN.
But surely they can't possibly actually BE HUUUMAN.
Oh that. just remember this is a yoko taro game. if you think he is going to do the same thing rise you are already being rused.
WHAT IS THIS THING YOU CALL E-MO-SHUN?
..same thing twice.
Doesn't mean its not currently looking that way.
Why do I have a shitty autocorrect in my brain.
There is not much I can say without going right into spoiler territory at this point.
Yeah i acn't find a working torrent for this yet.
And i dun have movies.
So i'll wait a few days.
How far in is this LP then.
I got up to the boss where a whole bunch of robots pretending to be humans produced some sort of bishounen.
Some sort of.
I am now intensely worried.
~MoonWolf has porn gone too far ? - You could say that if I told you that was the sequel to another video P.
Noelor if that worries you best hold on to your seat when you see what happens after that fight.
I mean I'm just worried you're beating up some poor robot's human husbando body pillow.
More like son.
Oh its a lot worse.
Of course son.
You're like my son but not actually because you're just a dummy I made so it's okay.
I don't know why I went down this path but sunk cost and all that.
Its a fallacy for a reason.
Although to be fair one of the rogues in our DD5 game managed to roll a -1 while brewing poison Nat 1 with a -2 penalty.
If only there was a fair way to roll first and then adjust stunts to the roll.
Did... did they end up smearing healing potion on the blades?
No she splashed it over herself. But luckily enough the Barbarian had rolled poorly beforehand and given her a halluciogenic mushroom instead of a poisnous one.
So we ended up having to knock her out with a sleep spell as she was screaming about imps crawling all over her tie her up and then feed her salt water to clear out what she had managed to swallow. Followed by washing her hair and shoulders.
Then we leveled up.
But probably not because of the hair washing though.
The hair was the last 4xp you needed.
Except we dont run with XP in this campaign as previously mentioned.
The hair washing was dramtically important.
Let's just go with that.
America is experiencing a glue shortage.
By the end of Wednesday they were all gone. We sold 20 gallons of glue in four hours. People were laying down $60 for glue. I could feel my Great Depression-raised grandpa shaking his head from…. I dunno probably Purgatory.
What the hell.
THE GREAT GLUE FAMINE OF 20187.
How and why is this a thing?
The glue slime trend that has swept the middle schools in our area apparently.
Surely <--- the ninja in ffxiv does a blade lick when you do the /victorypose emote.
I can't help thinking of that every time.
Play double piloted shredder.
Mage opponent casts frost nova.
Ends up popping both shredders that turn.
Can anyone remember where that crazy lunar sorcerer lady who eats babies lives?
Anathema probably can.
Looking forward to serpent sting kiting a demon down the length of winterspring then.
So apparently to sign up for the DD Beyond beta you have to use your twitch account. Okay?
For a DD5 rules repo that seems like an odd choice.
Is Peppa Pig a thing that exists outside of the UK?
Pppa Pig is a children's television programme broadcasting on Channel 5 and Nick Jr. in the UK Nickelodeon/Nick Jr. in the USA ABC 4 Kids in Australia and Discovery Kids in Latin America including Brazil. Yes.
Not any of the countries represented here.
I'm aware of its existence that's it.
Peppa is an emote on fae's discord.
But if nobody's actually familiar with the franchise that's about it.
MoonWolf the TP graphic in D1 is so dooft.
I keep forgetting.
Its amazing you mean.
Oh wow Black Death.
This is a mean game.
Just a bit.
Anathema should play it.
Too many graphics.
Does Arkaine's name come up in D3 items?
I can't tell if I recognise it or it's just *that* generic.
Do not believe so.
Omg Wirt is such a shit.
Also I think they just got the OG Empyrean Band so that's nice.
MoonWolf I forget did you end up reading Tale of Two Rulers?
Ganondorf is not good at handling incriminating evidence.
The worst really.
They must not cover it in Garudo world conquering lessons.
I mean I suppose it's progress that he didn't build a dungeon to put it in?
Which itself holds the tool to its own successful navigation.
Rinku is going to end up drinking it and then they're going to have to go visit some elemental temple for the cure.
This will happen because its maximally ironic.
I'd believe it.
But where does he live ?
In or near the ruins of Rathess IIRC.
Vindication because anathema is definitely the definitive resource for Exalted.
No I misremembered.
Ma-ha-suchi is near Rathess Raksi is somewhere eles.
Noelor GlennCuttlefish there is a twitter group DM for arranging Dungeon Worlds.
MoonWolf spring cleaning!
Get all those dusty kittens out of your house.
Anathema if that's a thing I got then I don't know how to see it.
In Plume at any rate.
Ok it works on the website so ヽ（´ー｀）┌.
But you may have to poke me here when you say anything in that group.
Because I do not use the Twitter website~.
Well we can discuss other ways to arrange things tomorrow it was the only communication method everyone had bar email.
Modern life finding out what communication channels you all share so you can figure out when to do stuff.
MoonWolf anathema is literally that xkcd comic from last week.
Why can't everyone just be on irc.
As that comic demonstrated by having it in the centre.
Irc is the superior chatting method >.>.
Because irc is old and busted cant even post pictures here.
Or shitty emotes that are pictures.
GlennCuttlefish i wrote a plugin that lets you use shitty twitch emotes that are pictures in adirirc.
I have yet to see good twitch emotes.
Also thats extra effort.
It's okay I have a whole website for emotes that work just fine in IRC o*>ω<*o.
Well more or less I guess.
Ah but those are not pictures are they.
Gotta be pictures these days C_A.
I am far too old school to bother with that.
Only place I do use it is on Discord but only really because one of the servers have a bunch of custom ones.
Otherwise I tend to avoid them and just go for the classics.
I hate to admit but I kind of like programs that allow for custom stickers.
I couldn't use those programs without my collection of smug anime girls.
Granted I have resorted to Kagaposting on skype whenever I go to bed v.
Kantai Collection related. They just work so well for I'm going to bed messages so people suddenly dont ask me something I might miss.
Oh no our head of testing is visting I'm no longer the most Scottish person in the office.
This can only mean terrible things.
Shank the fucker.
The new hotness has arrived on overwatch live servers.
I fear no limit will be a clusterfuck.
...hey what are you doing anime? I wanted to watch a silly light hearted show none of this suffering deal today.
Ok can confirm clusterfuck.
More than usual.
BwaS centaur clusterfuck ?
I wanted to give her a shot but i think i'll wait a day or os.
Yeah ran shooting range for a bit to see her kit.
Did No Limit game. Dorado defence. started 6v6 Orisa without anyone having to ask.
Grand total of 2 between both teams switched off.
She's okay like.
Decent health barrier's good ult is fun some control with graviton but not on zarya's level.
And it's like here's hitscan range damage in an FPS that doesn't fall off 2 yds later like zarya/dva.
Oh god.
Anathema nto actually going to play ?
MoonWolf nah was just on to get masters done.
Anyway flame golems.
Try them its only like 7ex to get started!
Wait no mights are up to 4ex.
So at least 8 ex.
MoonWolf.
I like that the Mutant people published their Kickstarter in SEK.
It means they're nearly at a million.
MairBear you think you're sooo funny.
Noelor feels like cheating.
Three lego bricks to you too.
Wat v.
To avoid the draconian locks that John Deere puts on the tractors they buy farmers throughout America's heartland have started hacking their equipment with firmware that's cracked in Eastern Europe and traded on invite-only paid online forums.
Anathema Felicity is such a goldmine of tv hacking tropes.
So I finally figured to give that konosuba thing a go that everybody is hyping super hard.
Turns out its that one show I dropped after the first episode.
Good gods thunder again out there.
Second time this winter.
Second episode was slightly better but still cant see the fuss about this series.
So far no thunder here just rain.
Would be one thunder in a hurry if it was there already.
Well I havent had any thunder yet is what I meant =p.
Jfc this DD5 session has had far too many fucking Nat 1s to be sensible.
Panic at the Wakfu went real well last night.
Anything notable weird/epic happen ?
The wardancer used his first turn to turn the flock of tofus into meaty coleslaw.
All of them ? seems OP.
The minotor spent the first couple turns not being near enough to anything to deal damage but once Qilby threw the remaining warriors at them he dealt... I think 11 damage with one punch and 4-5 with a second?
Movement isn't that expensive though ?
MoonWolf there's a damage combo that is quite easy to shut down if the target has armour or iron tokens.
No but he spent the first turn in a stance that sacrifices movement for power tokens.
And just didn't roll that great turn 2.
But yeah turn 3 those stocked up power tokens did *work*.
Oh you remember I gave Yahweh Void Dragon stance?
Qilby is frantic with both Void Style and Dragon Form.
And void dragon is still ridiculous.
Qilby spent turn one in a Void stance created a black hole.
Turn two in a different Dragon stance moved both remaining enemies at once.
Turn three they were re-advised on what edges do and sort of went Ohhhhhhh I should do that more.
Basically every character in the party has a way of feeling overpowered so I feel I did ok.
Next session CRUSH THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS.
HOPES AND DREAMS YOU SAY?!
Thanks for clarifying.
Anyway what I'll probably do after another session or two is ask especially the focused heroes if there's a stance they never find themselves using and just let them have the relevant books to make a new stance for that gap.
I don't think that's going to be a problem Qilby has that player grokked how to do the frantic hero thing very quickly.
You know when you're typing and listening to music sometimes you end up typing the lyrics?
Unless that's just me?
I've typed the wrong thing becaues it was on my mind or someone was talking about it.
Not music as such.
I don't think anyway.
Well I just typed My Body Is Made Out Of Love which is not a line from Unlimited Blade Works.
Because Stronger Than You was playing.
A very very alternate AU to fate stay night.
Not music but I have typed the wrong thing when I get distracted and think of something else.
I would watch the fuck out of this.
And then they all take him to DIVORCE COURT.
Have a cute fake imgur gif.
Looks like it is being made!?
It’s easy to ignore this message most people do. <- ITS REALLY NOT ANYMORE.
Its not taking up over a third of the fucking screen.
Anathema this sounds terrible.
Instead of dealing with the fallout of marrying 3 different pricesses lets instead go on a journey to find TRUE LOVE.
With a protagonist who cannot love people.
Oh hey look true love was falling in love with the aromantic woman!
Fuck you movie.
Wow you sound upset.
There was a good concept.
And they ruined it.
You know I dont think I could deal with the original concept.
Not sure I like this new one either but the original one sounds like 90 minutes of cringe for me.
MoonWolf yeah I was disappointed with the summary.
Finally having to not clutter my inventory with crafting material in D3 is really quite nice.
Flat earth theory is getting weird.
I cannot copy text from LPZ on mobile.
That is not an okay thing internet.
The always that lady part was debunked in subsequent posts incidentally.
MoonWolf don't kinkshame.
Things that are hards in glenns life this week Light.
I know right.
You know whats even worse than light?
The Ultimate Life Form?!
Does it have a gun ?
It's a hedgehog with roller blades.
Can't be that ultimate then.
The prototype was a giant lizard with weird bubble powers.
A lizard with a space station coming out its butt.
You know does anyone ever develop a prototype thats a clunkier easier to modify test version of the actual end product in fiction.
They're all either completly different or somehow even better than the final product.
This bothers me.
Anathema a lizard that impaled itself butt-first onto a space station.
But I can understand the confusion.
MoonWolf I mean the giant lizard can't rollerskate.
So that probably counts as clunkier?
Also is a lizard instead of a hedgegod.
I get that they decided to cut out the bubble powers.
Gave us this song though.
That makes sense a a feature that didn't work in practice.
Anathema shit now that's going to be floating through my head the rest of my work day.
Quick listen to Hopes and Dreams again.
I would complain about that earworm except its on my playlist anyway.
151713 › Kirisu It's a hedgehog with roller blades - in my case I was thinking of the old The Gamers video v.
I am at work!
It's worksafe. Unless the joke is that it's borderline porn to you =p.
That was in fact.
The Venezuelan Bread war.
I mean it's not quite the Great American Glue Famine.
But it's up there.
I'd say keep reading because someone goes into a bit more detailing just how fucked Venezuela is.
Well shit something is happening in London it seems.
A little bit.
Only two shot and a dozen wounded from a car.
Whre are you getting a dozen wounded ?
A car ran into a crowd near Westminister bridge around the same time.
Pretty sure thats unrelated.
That url and title are wildly unrelated wtd.
I blame the guardian.
That's because it most likely started as coverage for Brexit related things in the house of commons.
Notice the timeline on the left and what it said about 5 hours ago.
Not to mention that the headline mentions as much as well.
Things have somewhat escalated.
We have sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews London’s Air Ambulance and our Hazardous Area Response Team. HART just makes me think of Shadowrun and DocWagon response teams v.
Who because this is Shadowrun are usually heavily armed.
Netflix doing live action anime adaptions now. How things have progressed.
MoonWolf weird bug progress for Fellowship!
Compatible with both Driders and Muffets!
I did not realize that was a concern.
Neither did I.
But I see that it is the case and am pleased.
Would anyone out there like 80 mutual friendship hearthstone gold?
Yes but in like 20 minutes ?
Well that certainly took a dark turn.
Bwas quick give it to me before MoonWolf notices.
Don't actually do that.
I'm just going to dual BwaS for fake internet cardgame monies.
Anathema missed my bus sorry about that.
Ok we're still on chargen.
What classes are picked.
If you need the link.
Fighter cleric theif.
Hm. could go with a paladin then. or maybe a mage.
Also why the fuck does chrome take forever to boot up every time.
Extracting your tears for the salt turbine.
No wonder mumble was being quiet for me. it had defaulted to the wrong device.
That uh probably wouldn't help.
MoonWolf what are these shaman cards.
How is this remotely fair.
We at blizzard believe that shaman is not supposed to be fair.
Since WoW 1.0.
Had no idea that Sejic's wife was drawing for Rat Queens now.
This NPC subsists on nothing but pineapple pudding. Eating it over the course of a week.
The rest of the week she hangs around kitchens sniffing and biting the air and surviving on that....
What game ?
XIV Because she spends all her money on an orphanage it's sweet in a wtf is wrong with you way.
This npc is going to die from hunger.
Bascially new npc and method for crafters to get high end gear. Premise is you make priceless items for wealthy people she sells them for yuo and together you save an orphanage.
And every reputation up she tells you excitedly how she's able to eat yet more things which aren't even rotten or stale yet!!!
MairBear have you considered just giving her food.
You're a culinarian.
She would sell it.
For the chilluns.
She's a very independent character who can clearly make it on her own.
Just watched this ep. I had to pause for a couple mins.
I'm supposed to be fighting gnome pirates.
RPG is happening.
Oop. Fair fair.
Erm just had a mercy get granted potg for a res for 1... not sure.
Sign everyone in that match was bad.
What the shit tavern brawl.
Whats it about ?
Remmeber the one vs the stormwind armory.
It's that but with partygoers...?
You have to do a non-zero attempt this time.
Need to put in 30 dmg for the pack not just a sudoku run.
Tyis is bullshit.
I just did a standard zoolock.
And got to 106 and then it kicked me out.
30 is the minimum 100 is the max.
So surely there's a no brain play whatever you draw.
Deck for each class and quest type*.
Oh yes the next XCOM2 update has a perfect mission name.
Paragraph #.
Somewhat passive aggressive but sure.
Android gets stuck on boot while running from SD card.
So now that nier automata is finished yoko taro has spoken about opening a restaurant.
Just think about it.
A yoko taro maid cafe.
Its full of normal maids but every single one of them has an emil mask.
One of them is yoko taro.
All of them are.
!note MairBear.
I need to play DF sometime.
Is he really excited about boats because they're in ascii and feature stupid amounts of over detailed simulation for no discernable reason ?
Nice Boat intensifies.
MairBear is this a bard with a *fucking bagpipes*?
Can you get those in the game!?
Bit tilted by all the orisas running around on her legendary skin on release week.
BwaS they probably saved the gold.
!note Noelor i found a tweet you can be angry about.
Noelor why is this a thing ?
Geop runs that account.
Now i have new questions.
But you're no longer confused by the tweet are you?
Turns out when you travel to a remote caribbean island to host an online video game tournament shit gets fucked up.
Spectator client dead they are streaming board state by external camera pointed at player screens over shoulder.
And last tournament was also shit for quality.
And let's not talk on the filler segments of them wielding both a stormwind shield and orgrimmar axe on the beach.
Better enjoy it because its the last content we are making for this game for the next 2 years.
They have said we're going to Argus within the timeframe of Legion and not a 8.x affair.
Oh shit. c.
I missed the curve then xD My brother wanted me to keep his characcters up to date with that which was a shot in the dark.
I should uh... probably get through the nightwell raidfinder so I can see the spoileriffic cutscenes too.
Tomb raid will be a while after 7.2.
Aotc for gul'dan will still be up post patch until opening.
Ah but what about aotc helya.
Aotc helya apparently also pre tomb.
The only one I bothered with was archi for the mount.
Because thats what my mind conjures everytime it hears about that dish.
But why share -.
Noelor because you share terrible things with me too.
It goes both wways.
Well in that case.
Have a cute LoL dragon.
Is the transparency part of the dragon or just an art thing.
I think it's astral or something.
The spectator has been playing the ambient hum of like a raven idol for ten minutes now and it's doing my head in >.<.
Hopefully tomorrow they'll fix their problems.
Ooo crunchyroll have added gundam wing.
- I love this show.
For todays mission you will be strapped onto a v1 missile. hope your protection spells can withstand the shockwaves caused by going mach 1.5.
!note Noelor.
Oracle's commitment to UX is truly impressive.
Bad UX at that.
Yes specifically their commitment to having as awful a UX as possible.
Glad we're on the same page here =.
Noelor why make things better when you can already ask millions for it?
If a customer complains they'll just audit them and ask some more.
We have been successful in bringing in female summer interns so they can see first hand the benefits of working for a technology company.
Y'all dress casually right?
Anathema well done for alienating them from the start by calling them out.
But at least you don't have that asshat of an IT manager anymore to fuck shit up so it's a bit better?
MoonWolf hahaha.
Ok just had a My code is magic and I no longer understand it moment.
The other day I had a problem I spent all afternoon trying to fix only managed to introduce an infinite loop by mistake gave up and just made a note to train out that it'd need babysitting.
A great man once said debugging code is twice as hard as writing it so it you write the cleverest code you can you are by definition not qualified to debug it.
Today fixed a different problem.
The original problem is also now gone I am very unsure how they were related.
End of an era.
BwaS behold this card.
Yep watching it.
Druid continues to be Green.
Turn your mana crystals into minions.
I wonder what happens if a druid gets access to overload presumably through a brawl of some sort.
Then uses that spell.
Overload would apply to crystals remaining or new ones generated turn after or something.
Most likely is overloaded crystals don't make trees I think?
Could also see they're still overloaded when you get them back.
Maybe they turn into loverloaded trees.
Whatever that means.
More lightning i think.
You'll need to spell out the scenario of mana levels overload amount currently overloaded or cast on same turn as overloading.
<- muster for slightly less recruits.
Stand against a little bit less darkness.
Fix your colourblindfriendlyness blizz.
Til kibler is colour blind.
It doesn't come up often.
BwaS so hunter is back.
Maelstrom portal feels like it says hi.
Because you were choosing between mistress mixtures/fiery bat/alleycat/secretkeeper - we want you playing all of them.
Chained 5 of the 15 straight into eachother bloody heck how depleted was the rest of the deck?
Probably full of only raptors.
Itsa demonstration game afterlal.
Quest kinda reliant on that heavy 5-drop.
There's not just gonna be quest decks you're right I'll still be rolling against c'thun priest.
Fuck that i'm playing questing n'zoth priest.
Audio balance is fucked up all right side.
BwaS not suprised at all.
Make my questing huge.
Ahhhh after ten thousand ticks of emperor I'm freeeee!
That is not how you'd duel between a doomhammer and a lionheart champion...
And let's not talk about the blade of azzinoth in the off hand.
BwaS lets not talk about the b-roll at all.
I'm certainly not watching it.
Goddamnit why is the latest version of firefox so bad.
Keeps crashing around mere 60-100 tabs.
How much ram do you have?
But on previous versions I could go up to 150-170 on 6 gigs before crashing.
Well 115 it seems. but still. it didn't use to crash this frequently.
Close your f ucking tabs.
I might need that thread from a week ago on 4chan.
Or that picture I saw on imgur.
Your browser has a history window.
That doesn't actually cache anything so those threads from 4chan would be gone.
A big loss.
It is to me.
Why does it bother you so I have a bazillion tabs.
It doens't it bothers me that you complain about the consequences of those tabs.
I only complain when this POS crashes on me.
Which is what once a month at most.
Well more now.
Seems like PSTEE is a thing that is coming out soon.
BwaS goes this omegazero/samueltaso series lasted FOREVER.
What is with this event and going the full 7?
The yogg was fun though.
They've been streaming for 8 hours.
They finished two games.
Doesn't help the entire field is lifecoach's extended family.
It really doesn't.
Need to watch this greensheep match.
I got packs riding on this.
\o/ me too.
But I'm used to getting let down by the British representative so it's not like thijs.
God thijs was disappointing.
I apologize on behalf of my countryman.
I have yet to see footage of Firebat in the hot tub.
Hey man they got to keep the good stuff for later.
So today noticed that somewhere in between winter arriving and now pokemon go had received some updates.
Some good some bad.
That they at least give you some hints as to where you can find pokemon now is nice.
But I have to ask.
Great straight off he's admitting he's unfavoured. balls.
What the hell is this thing.
And what is it doing in my childrens phone games?
But hey at least I now have all 3 starters.
And waiting to be a skiploom.
Wait did they go back to nerfing ana now.
Oh of course the brit has come wearing superdry.
Harsh burns against the last matches.
Why does anyone wear superdry?
What's bad about superdry? o.
Not speaking in support just one of these things I'm not sure as to why there is opinions one way or the other.
I don't like clothes that are basically advertising.
Ah yes that has always been my issue with... well. things in general. Don't want to wear or carry something with a big obvious logo. v.
They're really comfortable that's why.
And really dry.
Oh hey new gorillaz material out.
MoonWolf Sottle finally got a haircut.
When did that hppen.
Based on first listen saturnz bar isn't very good sadly the only one with a proper animation andromeda and we got the power are decent.
All of them miles ahead of hallelujah money.
815 AM Fae Oh I'm not a magic salad I'm a longbow salad <- points if you can context this sentence.
No points for me.
And Mair isn't here.
So it's GW2!
But more than one class can use a longbow.
GlennCuddlefish if anyone will know what this is from it's you right?
She does look like she has 2 to 3 friends which she does cute things with in a school or school like setting.
Looks like yuru yuri to me.
Facebook have added Discord/Slack?-style emoji reaction buttons to messenger.
But unlike in discord Facebook will only let you react with 6 specific emoji?
You don't need more than 6 emoji in your life.
One of them is probably poop.
This is a terrible selection.
Or approximately those - Android font's face emoji are kinda garb.
So i'm watching this recorded nier 1 stream.
And i had forgotten just how ridiculous kaine's outfit is.
Now i don't have to click that.
There were too many comics to link.
MoonWolf oh is she already in it?
I was out last night.
She's like before the second bossfight.
Arranging a night out seems to be a good way of causing that group to stream Nier I guess.
Gues you'll need to go out more.
But that would mean more missed Nier.
Didn't go great last night tbf.
Cooked_Auto more VoDed Nier let's not pretend I'm not watching it later.
Though on the pc because Beam on mobile is not good.
It was on twitch.
Well I'm still going to wait till I get home but.
It'd be nice if they had some singilar streaming platform.
Instead of 3.
I guess I could watch it in bed now if I wanted.
MoonWolf it would be nice if there was a single invariably good streaming platform.
That would also be nice.
Well one can always wish.
As opposed to ok which one is the least laggy/unstable tonight?
Like I know Fae prefers to stream on YouTube but sometimes that just... doesn't want to stream today so over to twitch I guess.
Anyway I need to go try and find someone to remove my beard and/or nail gels.
Meanwhile I hate livestream chat for being a shitty buggy mess that devours messages and tells you the chat is too active when no messages have been sent for several minutes.
Annoying LS is the best option I know of otoh that I can use to stream movies with.
Or at least stream movies with the lowest chance of getting found out and get banned v.
Man I am started to get really annoyed by FFs inability to load multiple tabs because they take far longer than they should /.
These are some great googly eyes.
I know right C_A.
Granted it mostly seems like my tumblr bookmarks get massively bottlenecked.
Batch opening 4chan image links does not produce the same issue where I have to around hunting for that one tab that seems to prevent the rest from loading.
Also I forgot about Dre >.<.
I wouldn't feel bad abou tit.
Now that we know this crucial information about the Icons it's time to make a character. And man is the character creation layout a complete clusterfuck. The poser is not wrong about this.
Someone is doing a 13A write up in FF.
Its not that bad.
True but it still does involve a lot of flipping back and forth as I can remember.
Hm the commentary about the issue with backgrounds is something I have to remember for whenever I can get myself to run WC.
Anathema ding 90. also found a taste of hate.
I got a lot of mileage out of 'The mightiest former elven male model' and 'Used to be dating the Demonologist' 'Master of Pigeons' and 'broke off engagement with the Crusader by kicking him in the junk.' in the parody game I ran and they work fine for everything else too. Haha now those are good OUTs.
Pavel pls D.
MairBear who do you have cards riding on ?
Well he l ucked his way through the grand finals last year.
MairBear antonidas really wants to be in this game.
Everything is even becase there's 9 cards in deck elft.
What about the 4 vs 1 board and hand size?
DocPwn could have had letha if he played the whelp.
Well minus the freeze on the operative.
One last activate conditional or something?
Welp that's not looking food for pavel.
So much for frost nova.
I really hate how they display their win record stuff as lost and def.
The shortest thin you expand def to is defeat.
Which is annoying.
Should be loss and win.
/o_o/ greensheep take my energy /o_o/.
Budget emoji version.
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ greensheep take my energy ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ.
Oh man I'm rooting for Green.
But I can't help feel for a patched draw on turn 2.
MoonWolf nice what's the market price on that atm?
Sold it for 2ex.
I bought one of the these today.
I can only imagine twitch chat.
MairBear i try not to imagine twitch chat.
Oh shit iterm2 shows emojis in terminal.
Why wouldn't it its just utf-8.
All you need is utf-8 support and a font that isn't from 2008.
Because emojis are shit.
Graphics in my terminal!?
Graphics in your terminal.
Okay what client should I be gravitating toward to replace legobricks with emoji?
Imagine how useful that could be for terminal based ui's.
Personally i'm using adiIRC now.
Or the latest version of hexchat.
Oh hexchat it is.
Since I'm currently using XChat-WDK.
There are no other clients.
Yes yes anathema.
...damn I've been using irssi for like 10 years now o_0.
Wow that was even worse!
Even worse ?
The ◕_◕ and つ came out on X-chat. But on hex... they're all lego.
Go to your server settings and check if its utf-8.
Alright i forgot which settings menu its under but somewhere they should be a fallback fonts option.
Or alternative fonts maybe.
Can you copy paste whats in there ?
The stuff inder Prefs-> Chatting -> Advanced -> Alternative Fonts?
Arial Unicode MSSegoe UI EmojiLucida Sans UnicodeMeiryoSymbolaUnifont.
Okay thats weird thats a perfectly good set.
🍏 🍎 🍐 🍊 🍋 🍌 🍉 🍇 🍓 🍈 🍒 🍑 🍍 🥝 🥑 🍅 🍆 🥒 🥕 🌽 🌶 🥔 🍠 🌰 🥜 🍯 🥐 🍞 🥖 🧀 🥚 🍳 🥓 🥞 🍤 🍗 🍖 🍕 🌭 🍔 🍟 🥙 🌮 🌯 🥗 🥘 🍝 🍜 🍲 🍥 🍣 🍱 🍛 🍚 🍙 🍘 🍢 🍡 🍧 🍨 🍦 🍰 🎂 🍮 🍭 🍬 🍫 🍿 🍩 🍪 🥛 🍼 ☕️ 🍵 🍶 🍺 🍻 🥂 🍷 🥃 🍸 🍹 🍾 🥄 🍴 🍽.
What did that display as ?
What OS are you on ?
I'm very confused right now.
Even that showed as as lower case x and a big D ehehehe by the way.
Try adding Segoe UI Emoji to the list.
As in replace the one there or add a second copy?
Oh its already in there.
You don't have to use it at all but could you install adiirc and just test if you can get stuff to display properly there ?
Apparently today is a never backspace never surrender day v.
🍏 🍎 🍐 🍊 🍋 🍌 🍉 🍇 🍓 🍈 🍒 🍑 🍍 🥝 🥑 🍅 🍆 🥒 🥕 🌽 🌶 🥔 🍠 🌰 🥜 🍯 🥐 🍞 🥖 🧀 🥚 🍳 🥓 🥞 🍤 🍗 🍖 🍕 🌭 🍔 🍟 🥙 🌮 🌯 🥗 🥘 🍝 🍜 🍲 🍥 🍣 🍱 🍛 🍚 🍙 🍘 🍢 🍡 🍧 🍨 🍦 🍰 🎂 🍮 🍭 🍬 🍫 🍿 🍩 🍪 🥛 🍼 ☕️ 🍵 🍶 🍺 🍻 🥂 🍷 🥃 🍸 🍹 🍾 🥄 🍴 🍽.
That did work.
Well your windows isn't broken.
I have no clue why it won't work on hexchat.
Literally none as far as i can tell its all set as it should be.
You can make adiirc look a lot like hexchat though.
So if you are bothered by an abundence of lego blocks.
I don't think I set it up as perfectly but eh no real objection to hopping to this instead o.
I can give you my theme and making it have a treebar like mine is really easy.
Sorry to be time vampiring but sure!
Also if you ever use twitch through irc i maintain this plugin for it.
Because i'm a nerd.
I'm afraid its true.
I don't know if I'll be able to see you in the same light c.
Stream excitement was premature I tabbed in to see pirates with huge numbers on turn 5.
Well a tleast greensheep got me more packs than thijs.
<- a theme file.
Copy it to theme folder and then restart I assume? v.
No File->themes install new.
Then find it wherever you saved it.
I did the thing.
If i did it properly you should now also have icons in your user bar.
I have this.
If you go to options icons doe sit show any entries in nicklist icons ? if it does you can just check the enable checkmark.
If not fuck it.
Its probably worth it to go through most of the options they are extensive.
Not sure if we're getting more packs than with thijs with greensheep.
Think they needed at least QF for that.
Like it's 1 for ro16 2 for qf 3 for sf 4 for f.
It did the thing.
Brb to check a thingy.
That message needs to change for one >.>.
So one thing you may have noticed options has a search bar on the top left.
So if you type in quit message.
It'll get you there easy.
The power of an irc client not originally written over 20 years ago.
Jesus christ my die luck has passed on to real dice.
Rolled 3 1's today.
In one turn.
Impressive in a way.
I did win in colt express however.
Never heard of colt express.
Neither had I until today.
Its a board game where you are robbing a train.
Nice casual game.
BwaS where were these fast games yesterday ?
The last greensheep match was pretty handy though.
What was the last set results?
I was away x.
4-0 to stan.
Oh hey it's the valentine's day liquid tee.
Discard reno into loosing.
Well that's nice my brother and his SO has managed to get themselves an apartment in town.
Please stop dying.
That seems unlikely.
So at the moment I am at episode 12 of LWA.
I hate the main characters inability to be good at anything.
Little witch academy.
And the plotlines built around her failing.
It might be my AotS.
Sort of the problem with the whole series.
There is no character development.
Its basically the same story but a different subject.
Ehh. There has been character development but its just painfully slow. I can understand why this is with the rules set by the world and rules of storytelling but still I wish she hadn't had quite such a huge handicap at the start.
I wish more people actually... gave a damn ?
Here is magic school over here at magic school evreyone already knows magic.
We won't care.
Why are you doing bad at everything its like you're terrible.
Ven though THIS IS A SCHOOL.
That and the fact that akko is naturally terrible at magic.
Of course I should have checked how many episodes this has since I decided to catch up at the halfway point.
The worst point to catch up'.
Anathema totally worth watching.
Finally catching up on Friday's Nier and I like this game's complete lack of even pretending to smoothly link the cutscenes and action sequences.
This game is fairly budget.
I think nier automata it the first time yoko taro has ever had anything close to actual money to spend on his games.
And he blew it all on 2B's booty?
Didn't at least drakengard 3 have money.
Noelor i mean i never said he wasn't also a creepy nerd.
If creating something that glorious makes you a creepy nerd I will never join the normie ranks again.
I used to think that final fantasy 14 was all about bow harps but i was wrong.
I was so wrong.
Its actually path of exile.
Thats all about the bow harps.
Can they not both be about bow harps?
Do bow harps not have enough room in their heart for that?
Is Path of Exile too jealous a partner?
There is only one spot in my heart for games about bow harps.
I'm just not a poly-bowharp-game sort of man.
What about harp bows?
Now i know this is not a very popular opinion but isn't that just basically the same thing.
You're right it is not a very popular opinion. I shall pretend I did not hear you uttering such nonsense.
Even if I did not really like that ping pong girls anime based on first episode it does have a pretty good OST for videogame background use. perfect for my gottago fast playlist.
GlennCuddlefish the level 50 plot twist for the BLM quest.
I cant even remember what it was now.
That all the things you did to 'seal' the void were doing the opposite.
And then the double plot twist.
Play full match on mercy in competitive.
Get the huge rez achievement.
No personal replay highlight.
MairBear finally an accurate representation of hemet in hs.
Oh the way adiIRC notifies is neat.
You can modify it a lot.
But yeah its all modern and shit.
I'm not sure it'll be worth playing.
But its great.
Just fucking murder a bunch of cards in your deck.
I wonder if it would make anything odd viable.
EG Kazakus deck with multiples of 3 or less costers.
Play hemet turn 6 free up the deck to make sure Kazakus works.
Don't really need to follow the article title sums it up but some examples.
This is pretty good.
Also these.
Well thats nice.
Man what the hell even is this social media team.
So one of my main sources for Arma 3 mod updates decided to now making their full newsstream a subscriber thing. So I have to pay 7eu a month to read the entire thing v.
It's just dumb. I mean I can get you need to recoup bandwidth costs for hosting mods and such but when you're idea of doing that is suddenly hiding news behind subscriptions I get less lenient and more annoyed.
I pay £1 pcm for access to a discord server with such quality links as.
Slight lie I definitely saw that one via Twitter first.
As did I.
It is very cute.
But it was the most recent link and I cba to scroll for some cute frogs or bugs or doggos.
Don't worry.
Early morning coma colorings.
What they said.
Lineart not mine.
Oh then I don't feel bad wondering where the hell her waist went.
Sure just point out such flaws to me when I post my drawings here.
...I am good at this morning thing yes its still morning by my definition shutup went to make my third cup of coffee. reach the door. Shut the door and come back to computer. Realize my mistakes in life.
Cooked_Auto a very serious game.
Well I'm sold.
Why do you hate fun MoonWolf ?
My fun perception was removed after a terrible terrible accident when i was 3.
Did you accidentally nearly kill your sister with your fun powers and by sealing them away limit the damage to her hair looks cooler now?
Noelor sure why not.
Unsure if you meant frost or snowflake or what.
Emoji is a pretty ambigious language really.
There is no Elsa emoji.
So general snow/ice element wolf.
...wonder how many of WC's orc clans are emojiable.
Doom hammer ?
Those are orcs not clans.
's more swordsong.
Blackrock would be easy if only we could colourcode all emoji.
Idk if my emoji keyboard actually does colour codes.
Or if that hand is colourable.
🌑 or 🌚.
Wh is my screen filled with boxes.
Aaaaa it keeps happening.
Noelor likes to ruin irc.
With their weird boxes/pictographs.
Excuse me for enjoying the evolution of language.
If emoticons are the next evolution of language we might as well get rid of the whole thing.
They aren't emoticons though they are emojis.
Is fine.
So you want language to be harder for people to use?
That's pretty oppressive anathema.
Are you sure you've not caught Toryism living down there?
My screen is filled with informational pictures.
That have very ambigious meaning.
And some of them are emoji!
Emoji are exclusionary to blind people.
Aint no braile for 'vomiting face emoji'.
Tbh we should skip emojis and go straight to stickers.
Sounds like the job for a tech startup company.
Which are clearly superior.
Stickers are also great yes.
Though more capitalist.
Oh RE title.
Holden Hatewheel were basically forced out.
Being mostly branded and .'. advertising.
0728 Certain demands were made of the publishing schedule going forward that weren't compatible with what we signed up to do and we were given instructions for turning in material I wasn't comfortable with given that we're still both owed outstanding money for work done and have been for over a year.
0729 neither party was happy with the other in short so splitsville.
Maybe now exalted will actually produce books again though!
No saving that trainwreck no matter how quality your books are.
Unless they skip right to 4e.
I mean that narrative sucks but what 🌙🐺 said.
Being run by perfectionists of that degree was not great for production even before health issues Which also suck but I'm not sure can take all the blame here.
I'm glad all I see are little boxes.
....I assume your boxes are some kind of celestial body and a canine.
I assume the same.
Do you have to do that? It is starting to get kind of annoying with half the people not being able to actually see the damned things.
I look at it this way you can have 500 different good reasons why you still did not produce work. But eventually your boss is going to fire you and get someone who doesn't run into endless reasons good reasons to not have done work.
Granted not getting paid is dickish too.
And yeah I'll stop being silly about it GlennCuddlefish.
Though my stance is still that y'all could update your irc's Unicode and font settings to see at least basic ones like thumbsup.
A no b literally not possible on some computers.
Only place I bother using those is Discord anyway.
I mean I *should* update irc at some point since I'm running with a really old version but at the same time I cant be arsed.
Mostly because I probably have to redo a whole bunch of settings and such to make it to how I like it.
I tried can't seem to get emoji on this machine even though I have the update to segoe ui symbol font.
This is definitely unicode since chinese and stuff work.
Yeah I dont think I have all that much issue with chinese symbols as well.
Ah fuck it might as well update and see what happens. brb.
Well you can still join channels.
So it can't have been that bad.
Okay that was painless p.
Granted I probably still only see boxes instead of unicode because of my font settings.
I guess tahoma doesnt have that support or its just nbs-irc interfering.
Probs font yeah.
Nbs irc ?
Old addon I got that did a bunch of stuff like song announces and such.
Of course.
For what purpose.
Dwayne Johnson is in it it's gonna be good.
GlennCuddlefish so audiences understand what it is.
I refuse to believe that kids today dont know what a goddamn board game is.
I'm not saying that's true.
True I mean they are making a huge resurgence these days.
Not to mention people like watching people play boardgames.
I'm saying movie studio execs and producers think it to be true.
This is a sony film isn't it.
Hard to say.
I knew it.
Yeah that does explain pretty much everything.
Man another round of leaked Sony emails would've been great by now.
There's nothing worse than a sad tree!
Sad tree literally confirmed as hitler.
Catching up on Friday's stream of NieR adventures of a dad and his millenial book.
How the fuck is kemono friends #2 trending in twitter.
It's got a hashtag right in the name Glenn.
...as in its #2 position trending the series name is not kemono friends #2.
I am not sure if you are being serious or just noelor now so I felt I had to clarify.
Noelor and a very angry lady not wearing enough clothing.
Little column a little column b.
Soon to be joined by the creepiest boy.
He's not creepy.
His opening bit is literally how fucking creepy his mansion is.
So his house is creepy enough to scare off dracula he is still a nice kid.
I bet he shows up in automata to be like sup still a creepy kid.
Still depressed nier died.
2 months from now there is going to be emil had tiny robot dlc.
Which reminds me moonwolf did you buy automata yet.
Its performance is literally terrible.
By reports with my graphics card i'd have to set it to 720p on low graphics to get stable 40.
I thought the fan patches fixed it.
Ah thats a bummer.
133 AM feyerbrandx @QuantumFizz did you get Automita for PS4 or PC? if PC there's this if you need your 60fps HD maximum polygons and blast processing.
Noelor i don't need blast processing.
Glenn Nier 2 soundtrack if you're interested. Psw is hikaru.
I need to be able to play it on my monitors native resolution.
MoonWolf might also fix that?
I wasn't planning on downloading it quite yet since I am low on disk space but since the link is right there thanks.
~MoonWolf Noelor i don't need blast processing - but what about blast hardcheese?
Who boy poe did not like me downloading that zipfile.
Apparantly with that mod i could actually run the game.
Very tempted to go buy it now.
Apparantly i still get the day 1 edition.
Doesn't seem very day one anymore square.
Yeah dunno how that is supposed to work. but hey free DLC and all that.
5 years from now.
Everyone still gets day 1 edition.
It was just a scam to get you to buy it faster.
Considering I bought the game without even knowing of a day 1 edition I am not sure it worked.
Might not have worked for you.
Bet it did for some people.
The librarian wants to drink absinth made from tails???
If you'd have to sing a song in front of a bar full of people with your amazingly talented sister you'd need a stiff drink too.
MoonWolf PatternSpider.
It's rare I find things that PatternSpider would like.
Swamp *What* and Cheese?
PatternSpider incidentally isn't a neural network.
Chocolate Chips With Chocolate Chips <- this neural network gets me.
I mean at least half of these are basically epicmealtime recipies.
So i feel like its onto something here.
Star * yyyes?
Well kemono friends was my favorite shittily animated possibly post apocalyptic cute as fuck anime this season.
Wait that loading screen was not Yonah's diary.
No it was not.
Go back and read it.
Unsure if want.
Got a link.
GlennCuddlefish noelor is watching a nier 1 lp just saw the first research notes diary entry.
On a loading screen.
Wish I could remember how those went.
Pause within like a second.
Yeah but spoilers.
Well yes which is why I asked for the link. Thanks noelor.
...only through creating that url did I realise the volume was turned down on twitch.
Okay this game is either MASSIVE or steam is terrible today.
I'm still on 4% downloaded.
Isn't it somewhere between 40-60GB?
Steam is terrible today then.
GlennCuddlefish so how terrible is the fishing minigame.
I need to prepare for this mentally.
Well you barely have to do it and I found myself fishing for fun at times. it really casual however.
I mean really really casual.
I forgot about it a couple of times and still got some fish.
Sounds about right.
Did you play nier automata mair.
<- look right i don't WANT to do this but we all have to realize that if you make a widowmaker figure at about that size.
Reality is someone is going to stick that up their butt.
We all have to live with this.
It's okay people have stuck worse things up their butts anyway.
Fuck MoonWolf somehow I didn't think that's where you were going with that.
Where did you think i was going with that.
Cooked_AutoI have not but I've had a couple of friends mentioning fishing in a group chat to each other.
Oh i'm sure that'll happen too.
Damn it Mair v.
Some nerd is going to masturbate over it.
Thats just sad.
They most certainly will.
Cooked_Auto I'm sorry? D.
And then they'll post pictures of it.
Masturbating over the worst girl.
On the internet.
Which is weird.
But still not babyfurs so i can't really make myself care.
GlennCuddlefish masturbating over the worst girl - more or less true.
Second best butt at least.
Not everyone likes the same kind of butt.
I'm going to go ahead and say that's a very poor shape for butt insertion incidentally.
Not that I disagree it'll happen.
Maybe we'll get hospital visit pics!
I meant xrays.
I don't need that in my life.
On the bright side you dont have to even get xrays done.
Just have her ulti.
Have borb instead.
That is one fat borb.
I don't know why that was so funny to me but here we are.
That can't be good for you.
Looks like next season of anime will allow me to catch up with stuff. Can't see anything that would immediately catch my eyes just a couple of SoL things.
Finally watch onepunch man!
Sorry that series got its 4-6 episodes.
Might finally try catching up with jojo.
Somehow I lost interest in the middle of star platinum arc.
Jojo 4 or 3?
First stand arc.
Oh 3 then.
First season of Stardust Crusaders?
I didn't get far into 4 because I don't generally find myself wanting to watch subbed stuff these days.
But from what I did see it was better than 3.
And all I've heard backs that up too.
MairBear can you win a HS game for me ?
Mair winning at hs? unheard of.
I've seen it happen.
MoonWolf can try.
Welp absolutely *nothing* I want to see this season. Again.
Also how do I get adiIRC to add a comma and space after finding a participants name with tab.
Options editbox tabcomplete suffix/firstword suffix.
MoonWolf currently in a game about to lose to pirate warrior.
But he either didn't run or didn't draw patches.
Converted my zoolock deck y'day to reno for running lock quests to change things up a bit.
This being I don't have doomsayer dirty rat kazakus siphon shadowflame.
Opponent I got was warrior on ladder.
Can I just say I thought yesterday.
Ended up being c'thun.
MairBear thanks for lost of dust.
Doomsayer is one of the most solid cards from basic.
Doomsayer is the 7HP board wipe right?
S'pretty expensive too.
Useful and always gonna be around but sure as hell doesn't win games.
Well as in it's inclusion doesn't. situation etc etc.
What dust did you get MoonWolf ?
2 epics and a rare.
!note anathema.
We talking spellbender here or duplicate prep?
Big game hunter and lay on hands.
Ah good ol bgh.
The bastard I dusted post nerf to finish off the murloc set and get old murk eye.
Some arcane golems and ironbeaks contributed too.
Its the classic set aside from a few tier 2 legendaries or legendaries i personally don't care about there isn't much there for me to get i don't already have.
With your people enthused to try Scorched Earth... work on the boilerplate there Civ.
They're really into it Noelor.
Off to Burning Man?
I guess I like konosuba enough to watch the rest of it now that I gave it a second chance.
Full of suspense! And Birds.
I could barely get through the first episode.
Yeah I dropped it after the first episode as well initially.
It does pick up enough for me to continue.
Konosuba plz help we don't know how to stop the fanservice train anymore.
MoonWolf good thing I have nothing against fanservice.
That reminds me I have become some kind of sad anime conditioned creep.
Because the lack of fanservice in LWA is something I kept noticing all the time.
Its an anime. they have short dresses. they fly everywhere. 0 fanservice shots.
Its too late for me mair.
And trigger too don't forget.
Trigger spent all their fanservice on kay la kay.
Did kiznaiver have fanservice? Not that much at least I think.
Aside from the hedonist it was quite restrained.
The log in a lot campaign starts tomorrow.
Once a day.
Don't even need to do anything.
For a week tho.
Just press play game.
A whole week MoonWolf.
Were you planning to stay offline the next 7 days or something ?
But Noelor or others who play it less might still want free shizzle.
You get free shit for logging in for the next 7 days in hs.
Some packs some gold a legendary on the last day.
It's only a rare D.
But it's gold!
But it amounts to 100 dust 100 gold and 4 packs.
Anathema new Suits on netflix O.
As in Wednesday - Tuesday?
Looks like it's 8 days.
Wednesday 29th till april 5th.
So Wed to wed.
I keep getting a little mad whenever Jade sets up a Kill Zone then threatens to launch a frost bomb to totally negate it.
Omg this Cybersphere is totally laughing at the favour of his odds.
I think he's even further behind the plot than I was when I played.
I'm staring at my stash in d3.
Help how ?
Its so empty now ?
Should I just mulch -everything- that isn't a set item?
And/or equipped already.
I just mulch everything forever.
But the things.
The- fuck it I'll keep my crusader's stuff cos that was crazy high Grift levels keep a demon hunter set.
And burn the rest.
Is season done yet?
New one did not begin.
It will be this ..Friday I think?
You can disenchant the potiosn into forgotten souls now.
MoonWolf someone posted a fun idea. Dr. Boom MD. Summons 2 1/1 bombs that heal a random friendly on death.
I mean I'm not saying it'd be a good or fair card. But I was amused at the idea of a Rangaros Lightlord version of Boom.
Oh marauders is the DH set next season guess I'm DHing again.
Which one's Marauder and why is it worth playing a ranged?
Marauder is I heard you liked necromancer but didn't like witchdoctor. Have ALL you Demon Hunter Pets at the same time and about 5 turrets that also shoot your main spenders.
Aww yiss kemono friends s2 confirmed.
What a surprise its only the flavour of the season right now with everyone v.
Which is strange considering it was made by like 3 guys using calculators and a piece of string.
In my day people made good anime using nothing but a snapped thread and an abacus.
Like some kind of mongolian puppet show.
Mairbear thats a lie and you know it.
Anime was never good.
Anime was best when it was on the radio.
Anime was best when it was performed by a band of troubadours.
Shinjee enter thineself in the god forsaken robot.
Kemono friends spoilers. doodled another thing today 2 things now! super productive day.
Oh no.
Because what we loved in reboot was the live action bits.
Jfc roll20 stop having such shitty servers.
<- they're evil i just know it.
MoonWolf currency flippers are getting hardcore.
Hah beat you to that by about 11 hours.
Wish they'd say what hashing algo they used.
This is definitely a day for sludge metal.
MoonWolf we have been given a hat quiz because ????
Hat quiz ?
Anyway one if the questions its what hat Sinterklaas wears.
Meiter in dutch.
Is it actually different to Santa's though?
Is that the priest hat?
Cos he's a saint and all.
Mitre in english apparantly.
Y'know I would not actually have known that spelling.
I just wiki'd it.
Sinterklaas wears a pope-hat?
Red and gold.
Anathema he's a saint.
It makes sense.
Also was a bishop.
Before the saint thing.
Are popes automatically canonised? Idk what the deal is there.
Oh there you go then.
So you know started neir automata last night didn't finish the can't save section started it again.
2b starts teh game ruminating on the circular nature of life and wonder if she'll get to KILL GOD.
I dont think popes are automatically canonized.
I'm glad Dan cast Grace as 2B.
She's nothing like 2b though.
2b's priorities as far as i can tell form what i've seen so far Do the Mission Try to kill Everything Don't call me ma'am.
Seems about right.
Be barely more dressed than Kainye West.
My current theory is that whoever designed the andriods just really like gothic styles of dress and short legwear.
Seriously 9S wears shorts.
MoonWolf I mean yes.
Was that not evidently true of Taro?
And there is nothing wrong with that.
Pretty sure he admitted it.
Also what GlennCuttlefish said.
When asked why 2b wears heels I like women in heels.
Don't milkshake MoonWolf.
Is that what we are calling kinkshaming now ?
When I don't catch it yeah.
Anyway niera has a really good tutorial.
So i'm watching chips look at the demo thing.
To learn how to not suck.
What do levels do ?
Do they even do anything ?
It'd just be the taro thing to do you can get levels they do literally nothing.
Nah they definitely do stuff.
They just make the game harder.
Would be the other option.
Maybe more Miyazaki than Taro.
Or one person who also took the pictures themselves!
Um fuck this keyboard.
Here are some extra U's for you UUU.
Why is this chat turning into moonbase alpha.
Articles I don't expect to see o_0.
Anathema thanks the internet.
Yeah the warnings popped up on both my discord channels in this case.
I don't use Discord for other reasons but that's a cherry on top.
The language of the blog post is at best flippant I fuckin' hate Discord's use of language.
Oh dear. I might have to download the western release of NA soundtrack when it comes out this seems to lack a song or two I need.
Unsolicited dissemination of child pornography <- this seems like the dumbest thing to do.
Its up there.
GlennCuttlefish my steam cards are spoiling nier automata characters for me.
Well thats dumb.
Yeah I know people were saying on Twitter to never look at friends' cheevos for it either.
Because they're literally reach the point where this plot beat happens.
Sure but thats more common sense.
Well that was just a question of time.
Guess I should pick it up again then.
Since my judas channeling friends need not be involved.
This andriod wearing a skintight bodysuit.
Is complaining she needs tighter clothing to show off the effects of her gym time.
I was never quite sure if that was supposed to be the operators or the combat models line.
I could kinda see the argument if it was the operator.
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE A OWL.
GlennCuttlefish i'm a highly advanced combat android i can literally install chips into myself to give me bullshit powers.
I can uninstall my ability to have hud elements.
So where the hell is my MAIL CHIP.
Lost in the mail.
You're a gynoid MoonWolf you don't get a male chip.
Wouldn't recommend anyway.
I dont think 9s has a mail chip either noelor I am not sure this reason is valid.
Well thats the second time this game has crashed today.
Joke about fragile robomasculinity or something.
Joke derived from taking obviously comical remarks seriously.
Kill all robots.
Goddamnit every year this happens.
Spring just sneaks up on me. its nearly 5pm and the sun is nowhere near the horizon what are these shenanigans.
We did just make days an hour shorter last weekend.
Why do we insist on that again.
Dropping it would be following the russians. And why would you want to do that?
Wait the ruskies did it.
On one hand that seems like a good idea.
Pretty sure they've dropped Daylight savings.
But on the other hand russians cant do anything right.
So there must be some reason why its a good idea after all.
To confuse Russia?
Welp glad I wasn't planning on seeing this.
What the fuck.
Probably just going to see it anyway because the WETA visuals look great.
At least wait a week so you aren't counted by the people measuring how succesfull it is.
And nier keeps crashing.
Half the time it takes steam with it.
I have still not managed to actually get to a savepoint after the bunker.
Well I won't be seeing it until next week anyway most likely due to cinema scheduling and not wanting to see it in 3D vOv.
Still no female monk. Bah Humbug.
Now I am not saying its too dusty here but I just lost my duster while dusting.
Damned if I know where it went. I had it one second and then it was gone.
Looks like Persona 5 is a must have.
Notice FPS drop in new patch.
Wonder if it was just me streaming starcraft on the side.
Nope patch stealth ramped up all the graphics settings past my comfort point.
BwaS if you are intersted i can duel you for 80 children cardgame coins.
Sure 2 mins.
GlennCuttlefish fucking yoko taro put a female expy of himself in the game as a tutorial npc.
Also i'm a highly advanced combat android but i can't wak through a bush and keep sprinting.
Or open chests that are locked.
I mean that's literally what locks are for.
I ripped a giant oil platform robots arm off and beat it do death with it.
Can't rip open a locked chest.
There is kind of a good explanation for it. and then there isn't.
It wouldn't bother me so much if at this point i hadn't found more locked than openable chests.
Also i had a quest to go to a camp and so i went everywhere that wasn't that camp found the starting area again that places is just littered with dead players.
What can I say the game is kind of unforgiving on harder difficulties.
GlennCuttlefish also i changed up some of my controls and now turn on light is on d-pad up.
Which is fine. except that still works if you are in a dialogue selection thing.
So when i go up in the dialogue options i just toggle my pod light on and off.
What a rude robot.
Also you said something about dead players?
Like *Souls style?
So are you saying that in dialogue you have a robo light?
GlennCuttlefish i do.
Noelor they leave bodies behind so you know they were scrubs and you can do things with those bodies.
Like *Souls but with the capacity for you to be ruder got it.
I'm pretty sure this isn't spoilers.
Actually i have no clue what happens like on the bodies owners side of the equation.
Maybe GlennCuttlefish knows.
...and they were never heard from again I imagine.
Nah because when you die you need to find your body again to get your stuff bac.
At best they get some heals I think.
Never paid it much attention.
Illidan dialogue in new dungeon It seems preparations are in order.
In a version of Harvest Moon I'm watching cooking a potato with a butter in a frying pan creates... a baked potato?
Don't accept this.
Sounds delicious regardless.
Or even tasty.
I'm maybe tempted by this even if I have 1-15 in print already?
GlennCuttlefish your missing nierA tracks.
Derp forgot to link that mega earlier v.
Nah still missing I would guess.
Since its english versions of some tracks I am missing.
Oh wow hots subreddit already found something to complain about with this year's revamp.
It didn't make the heroes free ?
Apparently the retroactive loot boxes for levelling isn't capped high enough.
Thats my complaint.
Did divinity original sin get an expansion?
An enhanced edition and working on a sequel.
Thats a no then I guess.
I was going through my program files since I realized windows lies to me.
I just wanted to be specific.
And noticed I still have it installed.
So uninstall it is.
Why am I fighting all the schmancy heroes with a basic mage deck anyway?
Todays brawl is pretty fun.
Easy for a coop one too.
Or my opponent wasn't an idiot.
One of the two.
MoonWolf what's your twitter background again?
You mean my banner image ?
Just a cool image of some floating islands.
Oh not a specific set of them.
Looks kinda Talesy.
Full version.
Thats one thirsty bird.
Aren't they all?
I dont know.
Penguins seem chill.
But as far as I know they are born with their soulmate.
Also too cold to be thirsty.
Like the moment they hatch theres the egg next bottom for them.
What about galapagos penguins?
What like capybaras?
A Capybara is neither fish nor bird...... right?
It might be a fish.
The canon is unclear.
Certainly a thing I guess.
So aside from spellcomponent costs money feels useless in DD beyond a certain point.
I mean 5e in this case because my character earned like 800 gold last session and I have barely anything to spend it on.
Thats when you start planning ridiculous things.
Because all magical items have no set costs you can't really get +1 armor or weapons by the looks of it.
Glenn I'm playing a Wizard. Things are bound to get ridiculous before long.
Pick up crafting on the side buy materials make stuff that enables shenanigans.
Start your own exotic animal menagerie.
Build a submarine.
Buy a brothel.
DD crafting rules *shudder*.
Technically my character owns a small magic shop already.
Not even sure if 5e even has those.
Expand the shop.
Oh you're playing 5e. Well good luck then.
Convert the shop into a submarine.
Kinda hard when the campaign is set in Ravnica. Which is like fantasy coruscant.
Get a sky whale then.
Build shop on top of it.
Not sure if Skywhales are a thing in this setting.
Star a thopter factory tie them to a whale.
Now it a skywhale.
If it doesn't have sky whales its not a setting worth playing.
Especially since its not even legendary.
Spoilers Weapon History stories are back in a big way and they are CONSIDERABLY more fucked than Nier 1 or Drakengard 3. Like I need to keep a murder/suicide/child death counter on that shit because DANG. <- damn.
I have not unlocked any second or beyhond sections yet.
But thats one hell of a claim darkid.
I'm not even allowed to do the fake everyone dies gag anymore. Yoko Taro stole it all... Jerk. hehehe.
Oh hey I'm getting Gadgetzan cards.
...a 0/7 taunt for 2 really.
Is taunt warrior actually playable these days?
Just in some brawls.
Damn this jadestar lp update is over an hour long.
Noelor> it's 'playable' but maybe not on beast druid levels.
That is some deep shade right there.
In this week's brawl.
Destroying cards by drawing them.
Oh apparently I only today got my second Lightwarden.
Thats only it was only a good minion if you got it from a spell anyway.
Fae is stream-learning Crusader Kings tonight btw.
On account of Bad Ideas taking over Friday's slot.
I know i have her twitch stream watched.
Just not really a grand strategy sort of person.
Also jade lp.
Must have been thinking of anathema.
Follow up to CA see wowhead and mmo-c for further discount codes.
They got the abathur hat down to $10 among other things sorely tempted.
The Abathur hat is like 75% off already.
Oh nvm thought you meant with codes.
MoonWolf You should marry that teen you banged Eh if it turns out she's preg- Oh a baby.
Its good to be the king.
...since when has steam sold anime.
Steam sells actual anime ?
Well okay then.
!note mairbear bläzblü on steam sale again.
Or is this just a meme I don't get.
Oh the umlauts.
Bläzblü instead - yeah.
Its just how me and my friends pronounce it in finnish.
I must clarify we do it as a joke. it should not be pronounced that way.
I don't actually know what umlauts do to finnish.
They are their own letters when its ä or ö.
What the shit was that ufo chase route.
Mair hey MairBear.
GlennCuttlefish i found the missile pod.
It doens't seem very good ?
It really isn't. get kinda ok on level 3 but good luck getting there before post game.
Also i was going through the desert for loot because i though there is probably something in the old bossfight arena.
You know whats in the old bossfight arena ? robots that kill me in one hit.
Its a good level farming spot if you can survive down there.
Not at level 12 i can.
Yeah you can safely move on then.
If you want shockwaves you can find them on top near the save point iirc.
Yeah i found one of those.
Its one of the best chips imo.
Used it all the way through the game.
Hoping to find an inevitable witchtime chip soon.
Also have you upgraded your chips yet?
I have upgraded my only shortsword to +3.
Yeah but chips man.
No you need other components for that.
This is not spoilers enough i care about keeping it secret.
You fish by throwing your pod book in the water.
Are there fishing chips.
While siting on a holographic chair.
There is a fishing chip!
Moonwolf i know right.
It shows you where you fish.
I want this game now.
You can even see the chair in the screenshots I posted.
There is also an audio levels chip.
Its... for... seeing the audio bar graph of the background music.
You can customize your chip setup from OS up in the game.
You can uninstall such dumb features like your healthbar and the minimap.
Who needs those anyway.
Well on highest difficulty you can safely disable the health bar.
Okay sure on oneshot difficulty you can uninstall your healthbar.
Because it may as well be 1?
It is 1.
And get annoyed anytime you pick up a recovery item.
Because they're useless.
The hardest difficulty has you die in one hit as a feature.
Thats just how it works.
Easy game basically plays itself.
I thought it may do the thing some games do where like.
Normal... its normal.
Hard more damage more agressive enemies.
You have a number of hp.
Very hard like hard but 1shots.
It just so happens to be lower than any damage dealt.
I've not tried it.
It might be that it just sets damage to highest possible.
GlennCuttlefish let me ever know if you want to get angry over anime punching together.
Maybe once I wake up. or tomorrow night when I am completely farschnickled.
MoonWolf at this point Grace may just be a cuckoldry fetishist.
She wants Tedd to smooch a lot of people who aren't her ok?
Did i miss an update ?
For both though 2B Grace is just very into cute fashion choices.
Nah it its cuckoldry it has to have an element of denegration/shame about your partner not being with you.
Which is really far out of what grace is getting out of that.
Hmm unsure if universally true.
Tbf though also she probably doesn't derive *sexual* pleasure from it so.
I think this is the point where i bring up compersion ?
I think that's pleasure from knowing your partner is having better sex than they would with you?
No thats pleasure from your partner enjoying relationships besides the one you have its not sexual.
As far as i know anyway.
Words not great at being precise.
I don't make them.
More's the pity.
I'd make terrible words.
Full of ij's.
And g where English can't use it.
Spring was going so well and onw there is devils dandruff all over the place again.
Yeah that struck a Stockholm friend last night as well.
Down by the southern coast we just had rain for most of the afternoon.
Glenn had so much snow his mouth got buried?
With my heigh doesn't take much.
Please don't snowdrown snown GlennCuttlefish.
Dont you woo over there.
This is terrible.
My day is ruined.
My week is ruined.
My month would be ruined but its almost over.
MairBear up for a few rounds of blazblue in about 30 minutes?
Yeah its only like today left.
So not much left to ruin really.
I'm sorry you don't like my snöö.
If your snow would stop so cold sticky and wet I would appreciate it.
Seems like a lofty requirement.
GlennCuttlefish I might have to be that guy and only play like one or two characters at first.
MairBear I dont mind.
What ever works for you is my philosophy in these games.
Well it finished downloading gimme a minute to get coffee and I will be ready when you are MairBear.
Damn that was a promisng run of necrodancer c.
Choked at the last few levels.
Anyway I am on the mumb of le.
One sec glenn apparently the mumble gods favour you and hate me today.
They are fickle.
A person who says they don't want to be in a relationship may be a hipster who finds the word relationship too conformist and wants to have a cooperative sex-love venture with you.
Cracked there incredibly getting me.
So the facebook its complicated status.
Seems like it.
You know what we need.
An overwatch hero called cavalry.
Don't you ... me.
That's Tracer's partner tho.
Generic term used to indicate unknown marital status.
Thanks you for clarifying because in this context that is am ambigious term.
Could have been a beating up badguys buddy.
Or partner in crime.
It is generally used to disambiguate gender ok.
They could do crimes you don't know.
Anyway i just like the dumb joke that tracer shows up to let everyone know that cavalry is here.
As opposed to her being here to help.
Problem is that the game now already has an centaur character.
You cannot ride Orisa and it makes me very sad =<.
Must ask for consent first.
I mean obviously.
But her butt is intangible.
Probably not to bullets tho.
Not to bullets.
Like all tanks characters her major downside is a massive hitbox.
Also the estimated century it takes her to reload.
MoonWolf mechanically you were a Harbinger in Fellowship right?
The most bullshit class.
Not for raw power.
But for abitrary narrative power.
You already went there.
I thought you were asking because i went there.
GOOD THING I CHECKED REPLIES.
No I was going to type the exact same thing but wanted to double check playbook name.
I see people have already started using the HoTS emotes for great things.
Because my mind was sticking on seraph.
Noelor you could just agree with me on twitter.
What skin for who now?
Li Kermit?
They added Amazon?
Lightning javazon specifically.
Wow I have not paid HotS any attention for the longest time.
Is it just me or is lili's cup incapable of standin on its own.
The bottom is rounded.
Why must you point these things out.
I can't help it.
I just see them.
Dunno why you think Lili'd ever put her tea down.
Well they made the bottom a bit too rounded in comparison.
While brewing ?
It can get in the way of Adventures!!!
~MoonWolf while brewing ? - just throw a levitation spell on it.
Thats a priest spell though.
She's a monk.
Enchanted tea cup then.
A teacup that just floats right next to you at all times.
That'd sell for a lot of money.
Or just stands upright at all times.
Really wish tumblr page titles were... more informative.
It's retumbling that breaks it.
Kind of a big problem though.
Not so much tumblr as a whole i suppose.
MairBear are you likely to be playhing the start of the d3 season ?
I set up to do so but have not made solid plans plus my sleep time is classic mair so don't wait for me if that was a consideration.
I wonder if april 1st falling saturday this yr will make the affair slightly more bearable than usual.
MoonWolf Noelor.
Alright 10 seconds thats enough water for me.
Total war may be making an announcement soon.
Cooked_Auto yeah that's the plot as per the trailer too.
So can confirm I guess?
WHY IS IT STILL NOT TOTAL WARHAMMER.
Because franchise name.
Because GW and CA aren't keen on makng money.
Well they are.
Pretty sure the first game sold far beyond their expectations.
WHY IS IT STILL NOT TOTAL WARHAMMER <- INDEED WHY THE FUCK NOT.
My deluxe exalte is printed upside down...
Time ot write a pointed email.
How the fuck.
Anathema from the glenn commune I am mirroring your pain.
1738 You wouldn't be the only one. I think a couple folks have mentioned it.
I am starting to see how those two got fired.
Well the printing will be nothing to dow tih them they are just writers.
Pretty sure they were not eresponse for printing in any way.
Why do you lot insist on letting logic get in the way of a good joke.
Or bad jokes for that matter.
Eh a bit on the mean side for a joke.
I wonder which pieces of critical WoW lore Frodan will be bamboozled by this time.
BwaS quality stream.
BwaS they keep pushing that taunt warrior.
Whelp first turn and he doesn't recognise sulfuras yep.
Lovely v.
Why give sulfuras to a warrior fuck you frodan.
They gave priests an ACTUAL 2 DROP.
Mana geode rip.
It's just a jump to the left.
Timewarp because freeze mage needed MORE POWER.
Waiting on the inevitable track on the first trolden footage.
The elemental conditional effect looks nice in hand.
Not playing around mirror entity.
Oh boy more murloc aggro paladin.
I figured the adapt spell would be in shaman.
But no paladin.
Djinni v2.0 the plant. bound to have zero dodgy interactions whatsoever.
5/5 patches gang up.
Well done toast.
You fucking triggered the entire playerbase.
BwaS djinni plus plant priest buff deck super balanced.
Pictures of my book.
Hmm there's enough cards close enough in the ungoro set to make a mighty morphin zords deck.
Now if only it was not only in japanese.
The fuck am I looking at MairBear barablu?
But pretty much I think.
How was yesterday ?
Was that the orgy love-in?
I dunno it's what it sounded like to me.
I had *a* friend over.
Alright just I remember mention of drama and possibly triangles.
More of a V.
ANYWAY we seem a little empty.
Server died for a while.
Oh look a youtuber who makes english covers of anime tracks a new upload today.
With a history of uploads on this date parodying viewers' requests for literal translations.
MoonWolf I am a big fan of the aesthetic of demons wearing hoodies that say EVIL on the front.
Also Allison's new jacket.
Its a good jacket.
Also she's going to crash and burn real soon with this forcing royalty thing.
The correct perspective.
Let me draw you a graph.
First we need to discuss 7th dimensional math.
Noelor rayearth update.
About time v.
Oh boy v.
Tesco cashier re my satchel this evening is spacecraft like wor-craft?
Does nothing against infinite jade druid literally unplayable.
Well that was a night. Sauna and 50l of mead.
Your stories are funny but your website is shit.
I mean the headline's very onion.
Queen Elizabeth Frantically Trying To Preserve European Alliances By Arranging Great-Grandchildren’s Marriages.
One has not used one's offspring as effectively as one's own great-great-grandmother.
Yes I did go to wikipedia to check the lineage.
Oh I should have said progeny.
I only just remembered that was the word fuck.
It was fine.
I'm also not seeing that Rayearth update on my youtube subscriptions so maybe the internet is just fucked.
It was an april first thing.
Don't worry about it.
It was actually a xenoblade chronicles x lp update i don't think such an lp is actually running anywhere.
And... they deleted it?
I think its unlisted ?
<- if you really awnt it i guess.
Oh its a real lp.
I should maybe watch that.
Oh didn't know Games on SA had gotten a new subsection.
It's just TGD renamed v.
I dunno Alpha Complex kinda works.
Oh ettin did a april first thing where TG was actually Paranoia.
Ah missed that completely then I guess p.
Same too busy playing d3.
No idea when it happened so I couldve been busy with whatever.
MoonWolf they found the Chamber of Bone.
Blizzard protip.
Noelor i feel like this music somewhat underplays the general sense of dread this place is supposed to instill.
This is a room full of all the skeletal remains of all the heroes that went before you.
Its not a level 3 spell its jus the third tab in your spellbook.
The 4chan april fools was actually pretty good.
I'll be astonished if that tumblr isn't incredibly nsfw incidentally.
It isnt the april fools joke was a couple of boards getting mashed together. One of them being the mlp board and... pol.
Noelor have a lizard instead then.
Meanwhile Baiken has no time for Fausts tomfoolery.
All the reactions to that move are great.
I still hates that it takes several minutes or a forced reboot of FF to actually load all my tumblr tabs nowadays /.
So I figured I needed more names in my hearthstone card RNN. So a few hours of data entry later i now have a file with 7966 lines of text that is names of spells talents weapons npcs monsters etc.
Say about 20 lines of markup and other misc stuff.
Hearthstone has... just over a thousand unique collectiable cards.
May have overdone it.
You are starting to reach the point where you might as well just start making a competitor for HS.
Yeah go to china and release Homerock.
That sounds reasonable and accomplishable by one person in a bedroom.
It is nearly 4 years since Ex3 funded.
Time sure flies.
I still don't have mine =V.
So apparently they aired the first episode of season 3 of Rick Morty yesterday v.
So I heard.
Just so everyone is clear as to the flavour of trash I am.
I am talking to the friend I had over the other night about our shipname.
Noelor you are some high grade trash.
Straight to the heap with you.
MairBear now that I have a hangover from 2 days of drinking and partying how about a few matches of blazblue today?
True friendship Glenn getting yourself smashed just to even the playing field D.
Whens a good moment to blaz the blues mair?
Let us do the thing.
Blast the blues?
Time to see what material wealth the birthday skeleton granted.
I needs to be more cute.
Look we already have serious cute inflation in this expansion.
You can't ask for more cute at this point.
Welp! I completed a visual novel in 10 mins.
Bad ends do not count.
Starts with a coin flip you have to guess I guessed right.
Everyone was sent their seperate way in peace.
Good ends also do not count.
I probably somehow doomed the world by doing it? But nothing explicitly called out. Just everyone standing around confused.
This is not how i imagined this going down.
From what I remember of the game before this I'm pretty sure the world is now fucked because reasons.
You did it!
I did it!
This is like one of those sneaky vn's thats like that option you took 8 hours ago was wrong and now you're dead.
Go back to that point and try again!
Indeed but this was my first choice.
I don't want to say anything because Virtue's Last Reward was a hell of a game. But judging by what it did I have theories as to this not actually being a dead end.
Don't want to say anything to spoil a... 10 year old? game....
That'd be rude.
Oh 5 year onle.
Ending #1 achieved! Well done!
I did the thing.
<- rip my favourite class.
People really do not like that priest legendary.
Its a bad hunter effect on a body.
Dragon priest was good for like an expansion.
The expansion before all the fundamental dragon cards went away.
What will Kibler do? C.
Kibler was playing dragon decks when dragons were just the vanilla legendaries and azure drake.
Kibler don't give a damn.
Well some PR department is having fun.
Do you folks want a giggle?
Depends entierly what kind of giggle it is.
That looks fun.
My friend from school found his yearbook.
Also was having your tie done properly for the foto too much to ask ?
More importantly look how beautiful my hair was _.
0944 Don't want to say anything to spoil a... 10 year old? game.... <--- I'll definitely play it sometime.
Good thing mair didn't spoil it.
I know I'm thankful!
If you can you should also play 999 first.
But I didn't mostly cos I had no idea that game existed until I was nearly done. And I didn't -need- to go back. so it fills in enough blanks eventually.
I have that too because you said that last time I mentioned it p.
Really hope my DS still works after years of not being powered.

Don't want to say anything to spoil a... 10 year old? game.... <- to be fair it only just came out on platforms not geared towards children or lolicons.
VLR only just got a steam release.
Before that it was only on DS3 or vita.
I didn't know there was a lolicon target group for portable game devices.
That would be the vita.
Also mostly a joke on the platforms anime game library.
I was going to ask you meant the PSP or not.
There is a lot of skeevy games for it.
Lotta pantyshot games.
And its glorious anathema.
What if I want a game about school girls beating each other up that I can play in public though?
Does it have to be school girls exclusively?
No that's just the last vita game I remember looking at in a shop.
Game please it's too early in the programme to give me an existential crisis.
Save them for later.
Got to build up some existantalism fist.
Existentialism fist sounds like a great special move.
Welp that was sad ending achieved! Not even numbered so just fucked it.
And now out for lunch! o/.
Good gods. I think I might finally be starting to understand how hands work.
Based on comments on skype from an artist friend yesterday no you dont.
Does anyone really understand how hands work.
Starting to. as in I might be able to fool people on day.
One day. in the far future.
When dinosaurs once again roam the earth.
But now with convincingly drawn hands.
Always what was stopping the tyrannosaur.
How convincing their hands were drawn.
Man should I pick up Nier automata again. On one hand I kinda want to hear how it is in japanese.
On the other hand I did kind of platinum it already.
Oh boy oh boy is everyone ready.
2 days until AOTY.
Goddamn BORUTO man.
Why is this happening.
WHY IS THIS A THING.
No but seriously this anime season looks to be kinda bad.
Only a couple of cute girls doing mundane bullshit series and on top of that maybe one or two shows with an interesting premise.
Gods all these rank 20 control warriors bragh.
MoonWolf why won't Sumatra let me have more than one window open.
It's very rude.
If you disable tabs you get seperate windows.
So its tabs or windows.
Oh well going to bed then.
So that was youjo senki. Great show one of the best last season.
Pity no second season announced so far really deserves it.
Isn't that guy get reincarnated into ww1 is secretly amazing at tactics.
Well there is nothing secret about it.
Was always amazing at tactics even though there was no good reason to expect him to be.
Because this is a dumb japanese reincarnation wish fullfillment story.
Where the protagonist is either THE BEST or INCOMPETENT.
There is no eh alright.
Ehh. he was that way even before the whole reincarnation thing.
Now if you are going to bitch about him bitch about him being super special the #1 BEST AT ART AND MAGIC EVER.
I thought this was about world war 1.
You know trenches really stupid tanks artilerry.
When did magic enter into it.
15 minutes into first episode?
5 minutes into first episode episode 2 was the backstory episode.
Its ww1. except now germans can fly with gas tanks swiss with skis and brits with brooms.
I... missed this part when i looked at that show for 30 seconds and decided it wasn't for me.
This is why its 3 episode rule not 30 seconds rule.
I'm waiting for them to make an anime about japanese schoolgirl turns into tiny rpg spider murders entire underground dungeon.
O'd watch that.
Its a manga also a light novel and a badly translated webnovel.
I read the manga.
Anime could be good.
Cute so far.
That was a nice read moonwolf thanks.
MairBear that is weird.
MoonWolf not a pun.
Alright i have a 132 thousand gold lined up for this hs expansion.
132 packs worth.
Do you mean 13 thousand 2- yeah....
Only twice what I have.
That is a cool birb shower.
Do all your dailies its not hard.
I didn't have time from like October till Feb D.
3 week holiday plus brother being brother for months.
Get your bother to like HS instead of wow pvp.
I can't get him to like good games. Let alone HS.
Aaand over here in scrubland EU we get the expansion a day later.
Because ofcourse we do.
They lied again?
Only about eu!
Asking the hard questions.
Do i need to get gud to like kemono friends ?
In that it's difficult to watch but when you can it's rewarding? That it's memey about praising the sun?
Idk half my feed this morning ie from yesterday evening so far has been Clove losing his shit about that show though.
Someone in a HS thread linked a shadowverse card databse.
Holy shit this game is even more anime and half naked than i thought it was from streams.
Also randomly cute animals and vegetables.
I left my phone at home oh no.
No more sneaky instant messaging under the table in a meeting.
I think I forgot to put deoderant on too.
Rider riding a bike.
And a nice bike she's riding as well.
More amazed she decided to do it in costume.
Yeah looks uncomfortable but well done.
I wish my stomach could process coffee quicker.
It won't let me have a 5th cup.
5th cup already?
I have been awake since at least... half fourish.
Oh no.
If my stomach wasn't already complaining yes.
Anathema well uh.
Have some toast and then more coffee.
I'm not actually complaining about having been up at that time >.>.
Ftrbzzs I am at work and have no bread.
I'm wfh today so I can have emergency toast for you.
And ten another shot of espresso.
Not ten espressos maybe.
Always happy to help.
Noelor I guess in that it has some crappy animation you have to accept before you can get in the show. oh and that its starting to be way overrated yes its dark souls of anime.
Speaking of which we should start zapping people who use the phrase dark souls of x with tasers.
We should yes.
I am unsure if anyone's using it other than ironically.
Unless it's looped back around?
It probably has.
Considering all the dumb headlines I've seen that uses it.
Unrelated I am hearing that Andromeda has lightning guns?
From what I have seen of andromeda combat mechanics are just about the only thing I would classify as good in that game.
Apparenty the combat is good yes from what Ive heard.
The rest is just standard sandbox game faire.
That doesn't really seem like a criticism?
Well okay badly designed sandbox game faire then.
Since a lot of the complets are about meaningless fetch and grind quests and that things are far too spaced out for its own good.
Just that ?
Sounds like a party.
Sure is playing Demon Hunter my damage is yet again streets ahead of my survival.
This reminds me.
What survival stat is fed by int?
In Diablo? All resistance.
MairBear ++ for 'streets ahead'.
Thats a lot of notes.
I think paradox making stellaris was a great idea.
Finally they can make stuff that doesn't have to fit in the model of world/european historically accurate.
Oh great you can now enslave species for... food.
They don't make the food they are the food.
MoonWolf you can gene-mod a species to be extra delicious too.
I remember when Paradox said they didn't want a genocide button in their games. I didn't realize that they meant they didn't want a button but many buttons for all the colors of the genocide rainbow.
Do you want fast genocide medium genocide or very slow genocide.
Do you want to eat them use them as an army or work them to death.
Or just kill them.
Or do you just want to farm them as food forever.
Not that that's okay.
But it's not genocide.
Pigs are very far from the endangered species list.
There is genocide and then there is various flavours of permament enslavement.
Livestock is one of those.
There is however an eat them genocide too.
Or do you want to harvest them all for a rejuvination drug?
Well that's kinda creepy and cringey at the same time.
Anathema I just paid £1.20 for a 99 =<.
For example until recently Renault Sport Formula One Team used a 77000-line Excel spreadsheet to track the design and build of the season's new car.
Cooked_Auto there is so much going on in that bumper sticker.
Ayy project management by excel my favourite.
Have fun scrolling through that document.
Ftrbzzs could be worse could be gsheets.
And try not to cry too much when it crashes every ten minutes!
Could be *Word*.
No no more!
Anathema no DW this week right?
Or... is it this week.
My perception of time for the last few weeks is pretty gooey.
Yes it's this week.
Oh good thing I asked!
I will use the game scheduler in roll20 in future.
Nah s'fine I just have had a crazy month.
Weeks are all smooshed up.
This week is/has neem busy for me I haven't had time to prep yet /.
I knew they were getting rid of the Old Odeon but this is something else.
BwaS yeah I heard about that this morning.
Brodebot prepares for takeoff.
Plan is to actually start doing this when the new expansion launches.
Stock images are weird man.
>people who ask questions clearly answered in the little documentation we actually have.
How am I meant to lose myself in Persona 5 if they won't deliver it on time >C.
MairBear have you considered obsessivly looking at a calender talking to people awnsering dumb quizzez online and pretending to shoot yourself in the head ?
I've done all those things.
MoonWolf it worked. That summoned the mail and I didn't even get to calendar chekcing yet.
See you two weeks from now.
Well while the intent was more of a try x months I will make appearances for Un'goro if nothing else P.
Andromeda also seems to have a mobile app akin to WoW Legion's.
Which is uh... interesting.
Why would you need that though.
The younger half of my team at work are both playing it.
And will occasionally advise on the status of their missions.
The younger half are like both 25 I think.
The marginally less old half.
Kids these days have no taste no respect for the classics.
Back in my day.
Rabble rabble rabble.
Noelor you know how in BlazBlue Tager complained about having a teenage daughter...?
Welp same voice actor on this grumpy old man who is looking after a teenage character.
Grumpy old man looking after teenager.
This is becomming a bit of a videogame cliche.
I put it in the most cliche terms I could improvise. To not give anything away.
I just can't like things that i like if they are feminist Noelor.
My new favourite voting system.
I figured people would be voting more money.
She's been streaming Recettear a while.
Man what the hell was my TSW pass.
Its a secret.
I'm super clever.
I get the feeling you are not taking me very serously right now.
I'm not the most mature person. I had that 'Nuclear' song from or associated? with MGSV... And I just sang the chorus out loud but pronouncing it 'Noo-kyu-ler and had to stop cos giggle fit.
MoonWolf I would not have called Rinku is persuaded to empty the bottle to start their collection gotta say.
I have no idea if the new fancanonisation of Link as genderfluid is specifically BotW!Link or applied retro/proto-actively.
Noelor going to say that I CALLED IT.
Ok because I can't remember what you actually said... two weeks ago?
But I do remember you mentioning Rinku maybe.
2017-03-21 094446 rinku is going to end up drinking it and then they're going to have to go visit some elemental temple for the cure.
2017-03-21 094518 this will happen because its maximally ironic.
Behold my superpower irc logs.
Yeah fair enough.
MairBear hearthstone patch with the most important change.
MairBear I think Tharja may be the only character to be more reasonably dressed in TMS#FE than her original outfit.
Not hard though...
Talking that sounds hard.
Have you tried it?
It's a lot harder than vicariously starting at people.
Anyway Panic time woo!
Unless the conditions change VLR is dumber than I was lead to believe.
Depending on what you mean by conditions....
There is no way of discussing this without going into spoiler territory is there.
And I am not even that far in the game.
You make a good point.
I could PM on discord but I'd probably not be able to respond in an unspoilery way.
Have you completed it?
Oh yah but like 4 years ago.
I brushed up on it so I could appreciate Zero Time Dilemma.
We have a discord now?
Not that i'm aware off.
No but me and mair share a couple. also I think friendlisted.
I should do that.
MairBear GlennCuttlefish discord names ?
Should be just glenncuttlefish ?
Or did it have thos enumber things I have to dig up.
GlennCuttlefish how did you dig up your number.
There it is.
Plain as day.
Its below your name in the bottom left.
MoonWolf and indeed anyone on discord who hasn't added already mairnai#6858.
I dun goofed and lower-cased c.
Reckon this cardback will go amazingly with liadrin paladin.
Thats real nice.
Title is sunwell May ladder reward.
I like this card's flavour text.
Volcanosaur - Always fun to say out loud VOL-CA-NO-SAUUUR!
I fear too many will pronounce volcano as volcano.
And not take cues on how phonics often roll in dinosaur names.
And here we have obligatory rocky horror reference.
Open the Waygate - Although powerful the incantation is simple. It’s just a jump to the left and then a step to the right.
GlennCuttlefish so i'm reading a niera lp and apparantly there is a specific ending for self destructing in the bunker.
Go play the game.
Sort of busy with this hs card generator.
And i was doing diablo stuff too.
Why are you wasting your life with inferior blizzard products.
When you could be playing glorious insanity by a famout shut in from japan.
They're good products glenn.
I can see people enjoying them. however I do recommend playing nier automata instead of watching a playthrough of it.
I'm going ot make sure to stay ahead of it.
Also its screenshots.
Also it only just left the tutorial.
I'm at least 1 boss ahead.
You could be done with it by now however.
I'm savoring it!
Its going cold.
Savor with haste.
Cooked_Auto glad to see Ohmadon on board with botship.
Good to know.
That h is in the wrong place but I was doing it from memory~.
Noelor i've decided to give up and am now friending people on discord. can i have your magic thingy ?
Yeah the terms of my cooperative sex-love friendship venture require me to get permission before sharing that externally.
You're right i'm not allowed to add you.
You have to add me probably because of the terms.
I actually asked and was going to take a screenshot as a very dumb joke.
But then I had to explain how Discord worked instead.
I'm sorry modern technology ruined your dumb joke.
What's there to explain it's another skype ventrilo teamspeak msn messenger.
Literally the friend code part.
They basically stole it from blizzard.
People are making dumb mistakes in this mystery game.
Such is the way of mysteries.
GlennCuttlefish you'll be happy to know that MoonWolf being on discord means we can discuss emoji there instead.
And have been almost exclusively.
I think I now know the disgust moonwolf feels when I pun.
This will probably not stop irc emoji from happening.
The golden volcanosaur distribution is now live.
It appears you can add it to decks and craft a 2nd or shard it.
All other cards still locked out.
None of the provided recipes include it though not even the hunter or beast druid.
Okay hotform just went on EU to play a rank 15 game with new volc.
Pwning a zoolock begging them not to concede so he can drop it.
Turn after he gets his down the lock plays one as well <3.
That was certainly a lot of sexy 1's and 0's in that video with some porn funk.
<- a good catte.
Oh god I want one.
Why are cats.
Thats a very good question.
I have no awnser.
It ate too fast made itself sick and naturally couldn't stand over the wooden floor or walk the two meters to go outside.
Nope had to run 15 metres to our hallway carpet and divest itself there. v.
UNITE THE TRIBES.
How will our heroes proceed? Will they overcome their adverseries or will they die trying? Find out next time in the next meta snapshot.
MoonWolf do you by chance have that Trump talking about Priest link on hand? >.>.
2017-04-03 094311 <- rip my favourite class.
That one ?
Anyway lets check what this brawl is.
Ooh this looks like a job for silence steal my opponents minions n'zoth priest.
A deck only viable in this brawl.
Or i could load up my first game and run into an insta concede.
That could happen too.
Which is a shame because that means i only get to win 1 more brawl.
Due to my suboptimal quest of win 3 matches.
Anyway i'm posting a lot of brodebot cards even though nobody knows abut brodebot yet so it'll have some history.
And posting reddit stuff saturday.
And hopefully people won't ignore/hate it.
Because i don't want to be hi reddit i made a thing look at its 2 cards tweet history!
I did notice you've followed Brode and the other director? tho P.
They are the two people on the development team that have serious active hs related twitter presence.
Blade Harch seems good.
Actually rather fair too.
I don't think its good enough.
Oh is it officially HeavensWard?
Wait one word ?|.
The exapansion is Heavensward.
Was it not even that?
However there is a Heavens Ward.
And we constantly go heavensward.
And basically they use that whenever they can.
I didn't imagine the dumb ambiguating lack of space.
Still unsure if the expansion name refers to the direction towards heaven a ward of heaven as in a minor heaven has parenthel authority over a literal ward district of heaven or a ward the magical protection of heaven or a ward against heaven.
The important question.
Heavensward is a really ambigious title.
MoonWolf I played the thing.
I still don't know which.
But it's definitely multiple.
MoonWolf I thought it was also capable of being a Heaven Sward that being some weird fantasy mcguffin.
Isn't sward just grassland.
Also have this horror.
The cutest horror.
Also because i am a pro at thing.
I have the ultimate way to manage two twitter accounts.
I use firefox for my normal one and chrome for the other!
Also called tweetdeck.
MoonWolf refuses to ap.
I certainly do for twitter.
Ungoro happening to the US!
Not us though!
Which means in an hour I'll be able to watch people playing it there.
An hour because all the streamers have to unpack their 400 packs.
Like they'll finish in that time.
The worst part is like.
1 its not your packs why is it even exciting.
2 after 50 packs are you not pretty bored with it ?
Also as a streamer i'd just want a i'm opening 500 packs just gimme the cards and let me skip the animation option.
And some way to not have to click a pentagram.
Blizzard i'm opening enough packs to get every card or at least craft every card after duplicates just gimme my cards damnit.
Technology not there yet.
Actually maybe they should just have an website option for streamers pay whatever amount blizz wants that you are going to write off as a buisness expene and we just set it so your account has all the cards for this expansion.
Well then you get into the question of goldens and the vaunted fairytale that is Kripp and his button.
Fuck kripp and fuck his button gimmick.
Pay times X to be a Golden Streamer.
His... button gimmick?
He never dusts cards and constantly plays arena.
So has a ton of duplicates saved up.
Until he knows the dust value will be enough for full golden collection.
He does dust!
The gimmick is that he's only going to dust them when he has enough dust to craft his full golden collectoin.
And he runs about 10 smurfs.
Specifically when a card gets changed.
So full refund etc.
Yes but onl because thats more dust optimal.
Anyway the real gimmick is that he'll never actually do it.
Because the talking about the gimmick is worth more to him than the actual doing it.
Apparently he thinks he'll have enough post ungoro to go full golden for the mammoth standard rotation.
Doubt he'll actually do it though.
Blade Harch seems overpriced imo.
There's a dog in kripps stream cam.
It got immensely better.
74 thousand people are watching kripp NOT open packs ?
74.3k according to twitch.
74 thousand people are watching kripp play minesweeper and sit in HS queue.
He's the second highest stream.
Next to a csgo tournament.
Amaz is 4th and he's opening packs.
Life is strange.
Because amaz is a drama queen wanker who explodes over every draw and play.
*FALLS OUT OF CHAIR!*.
BwaS sure but kripp isn't even opening packs.
He's literlaly not getting past the giant queue.
Amaz at least is in the game.
Yet less viewers ?
Amaz's viewerbase have to do their homework sometime you know.
Or play persona.
Damnit. I couldn't raise my knowledge before the exams C.
Calendering is hard.
Especially when at least every third day sometimes far more is just taken from me. Or filled with a scripted thing.
I rented a DVD to raise a stat and didn't get to watch it till it was accruing late fee just because a bunch of not even important side features got introduced one after the other and stole all the days D.
Rented a dvd what is this 2005 ?
So i'm a highly advance combat andriod. i've been given an official mission to improve network quality on the surface of post post post apocalypitic earth.
They need some materials.
Specifically they need 1 rusty bolt 1 small gear 1 broken key.
I just left a fucking SPACE STATION.
Why are you getting me to deliver some rusty junk.
Why do you think the space station had any to spare?
Because its a space station.
What they can make me an infinite supply of extra bodies to download into when i die.
But they don't have a spare bolt.
MoonWolf I'm a broke student my only option was a second hand CRT with built in player xD.
I thought this was a game about robbing banks and sticking it to the bank.
Why are you broke.
Not good enough at laundering his money yet.
Really poor at picking which banks to rob?
MairBear this pressure room pinata puzzle is some nintendo weather channel bullshit.
MoonWolf I can't rob banks and study for examn.
How I feel with this puzzle.
GlennCuttlefish I can't remember it.
Probably blanked it out.
Sounds about right for Sakura Trick yeh.
GlennCuttlefish i trust pascal and her evillage even less than the average machine that doesn't instantly attack you.
I mean I cant blame you.
Also the opera boss lady its not spoilers cause it was in some review thing release before the game came out the real boss is the FUCKING CAMERA.
Seriously the second phase where she isn't actually fighting you took most of my damage there.
If you're going to force me top down at least zoom it out a little.
A very Noelor concern how many of my pillowcases actually sort into matching pairs?
MoonWolf it took me a little to long there to realise you weren't talking about the Pascal from Tales of Bat At Feelings.
I trust her for some things.
Not feelings things though.
Also the most frustrating part of this game go around looking for stuffoooh you found a chest.
Not allowed to open this chest yet.
Just ignore it. you'll get there sooner than later.
Has Adam not given you clearance to use keys?
GlennCuttlefish it makes exploring feel a little frustrating.
Its fine its fiine.
About time the jand meta got some counters.
I got the 80 friendship gold quest atm if anyone fancies a game.
If HS would load.
Instead of hang.
That'd be nice.
The rogue quest is kinda bs too D.
They played that one card that draws and copies a minion to get the 1 mana 2/1 charge pirate.
I like the idea of rogue having a quest that buffs their cheap minions I guess? But not when it's 2/1s with charge that become 1 mana 5/5s with charge.
So far it seems Un'goro has adressed the agro situation by making every deck more agressive than pirate warrior.
Toast found his way back to blizzard jail.
Oh Toast you are a treasure.
Playing warlock murloc.
Vs a druid who has played 1 card literally just the one by turn 5.
And that was healing touch v.
Had a game v druid with questing hunter.
Turns out jade decks are still a thing.
I lie there was the token golden volcanosaur in there.
All that saved my arse was rolling taunt on animal companion and him leaving one leokk up from first COTW.
Feels like azure drake fucking off has led to some desperate deckbuilding in terms of card draw.
!note Noelor ʰᵉˡᵖ.
MairBear os bittertide hydra is new version of that warlock minion that kills warlocks.
I am surprisingly okay with this combination.
I'm just going to say that the major is bisexual and probably into hot andriods with very large weapons.
I'm aware of the first part p.
The actual meat of the post made me giggle quite hard.
MoonWolf so that thing Toast did makes me sad for one reason.
Infinite Value Yogg Priest can't be a thing until blizz fix the issue C.
Like just infinitely cycle spells then play yogg and see what happens. It sounds hilarious time.
You'll get 30 spells max per yogg.
60 for brann yogg.
That's lame C.
Thats been known since yogg was shown off the first time.
Ofcourse yogg will have killed himself one way or another by around 15 spells.
If not through direct damage with brawl or DOOOM!
Oh of course.
MoonWolf it seems the warlock quest is doomed to concede by turn 4.
Because both warlocks i've played end up discarding their discard two cards cards in the opening rounds.
That is sort of the problem with discardlock.
Discarding the Wrong Cards.
And finally got Maiev.
It took me this long to just say fukkit and stop trying to have fun.
And just out face the face.
It is still the place.
Well I was midrange rather than pure face.
Which gives me enough to say f you quest rogues.
I think I might have to take a Gatekeeper approach if I can't have fun I can at least shut down a specific shitty deck.
You need to get to 10 or 5 for that.
At least 15.
Also did a Wild game to finish my 47/50 warrior cards played. Rogue opponent. Coins lorewalker Cho.
Next turn 2 counterfeit coins barnes.
So I uh... kill cho... trade the 1/1 stalagg that popped out. Spend the coins to arcanite reaper on turn 3.
I think it was some weird attempt at a flood opponents hand with cards deck ?
I mean his opening hand was cho two coins and Feugen.
And he topdecked the Barnes that brought out stalagg.
So maybe it's some kind of infinite Thaddeus?
Thats an idea.
Of course this mage had Pyroblast.
That's how pyroblast works yes.
MoonWolf link broken.
You'll read it eventually anyway.
Are they being turbosad.
Or just dumb.
Austen was not ready for Sunati's parents.
Why are there three of them????
Austen come on.
You live in the transhuman spacefuture.
This tension is cruel.
Welp that was my brother moving out of the house with his SO then.
Hooray for extra space/privacy! Boo for less familial participation. C.
Dad is getting his room in the basement back as his Lego room =P.
Besides the two still live in the same town as us.
Guess they had to be lego.
You live in the transhuman spacefuture <- also you're into women stop kinkshaming her parents for being poly.
I was implying that!
We have otoh had our giggle over now having to invite him to our place for dinner.
Noelor i explicteded it.
Though sunati never really explained it nor did the comic before now.
She just sent an image with her parents and vish.
Who was vish ? could have been an uncle or a good friend of the family for all austen knew.
Less attached to Sunati then her folks certainly.
The Saxa Wildrage seems a little confused.
Shaman Paladins are a thing okay.
They're dual spec.
Wow rare iteration of 100% win rate in the weekly heroes brawl run.
Of course my arena opponent got nu elise AND tirion.
To my single epic which is a fairly mundane one at that.
Hello friends I'm hereby politely requestion some upvotes for this thread.
Well there are worse things I could upvote on the subreddit.
Maybe we could collective whine about how hearthstone is dying forever due to a thing.
Due to boob jiggle physics I think.
Shadowgate is killing hearthstone ?
Just had a mage opponent hit me with 3 flamestrikes in as many turns.
> start arena run.
> shaman opponent drops a gvg mech card turn 2 at 0-0.
Well this is gonna be fun.
You have power creep on your side rite?
4 mana 77 perfectly on curve probably not.
Yep well played blizz.
Give me an opponent who sits on a wildly pre-standard rotation 0-0 arena deck for 6 months first game.
And now we got a lucky bastard who rolled malchezaar.
YEP the priest got a fucking deathwing off the malchezaar right as I was about to win the game.
2-1 when I thought this was going 0-3 from the draft okay.
You still beat the priest? O.
Was out of deathwing lethal range and dropped a stealth minion that would have lethal my next turn.
Annnnnd this warlock at 2-2 received 3 mortal coils in their draft.
Think there's about 5 turns now they've roped out.
Yep turns out when you give a warlock triple mortal coil bane of doom and new implosion they can win at hearthstone.
Oh and their new class minions are busted.
Welp that was a fun and interactive hour or so for 80 dust.
Is Night Path not just.... already a druid card?
Yeah but i liked the name for its flavour combined with the effect.
You take a secret path at night to get bigger creatures out earlier.
Because you are a sneaky druid.
Am I more tired than hungry or more hungry than tired.
The tough questions of 1am.
Also I wonder if with the wild/standard split now existing we'll ever see cards come back in future sets.
Or maybe they'll just promote them to Classic the same way they booted Sylvanas out.
MairBear final fantasy 14 automata.
It's in the Trolden it seems more of a luck gimmick than something you can plan for given how nebulous discards are.
!hs cruel dinomancer.
Oh i need to fix the blok thing.
Is that a string length limit or something weirder?
But i need ot have a look at it.
It might be it included a newline in the string.
I have no clue what this tweet is about but its a thing.
GlennCuttlefish this girl machine wants 9s to teach her about babies.
Also 2B has a cute pink bow now and i'm never unequipping that.
Unless there is a way to equip it on a pod.
Because i'd totally give my pod a pink bow.
!hs Azure Drake.
I just needed to know what hearthhead is calling the hall of fame.
!hs cruel dinomancer.
Okay i should have made the newline symbols spaces instead of deleting them.
!hs cruel dinomancer.
Fake gaming is ruining gamers.
!hs elder longneck.
That thing + innervate is horror.
But its just a terrible rager with adapt.
I mean if they get +3 health.
It's a turn 1 5/4.
Okay maybe it's more niche than I thought buit it did seem scary therr xP.
Spiritsinger + Weasel is not as good as we hoped C.
It just makes the weasel go into the other deck and disapear from the board.
That reminds me.
I was going to make a wild deathrattle priest deck.
One of these things is not like the other...
My first legendary of this season is a level 10 Leoric's Crown.
From some rando in act 2 of adventure mode >.>.
The Damned March 4th.
Never take it off while leveling.
I also got a gem goblin earlier so have more than enough rubies to upgrade once and slot in it.
Upgrade twice in fact.
Shen's cheaper to train than I thought.
I am not sure what to think of this series yet.first episode was setup second episode so far is feel good stuff but I fear they are just lulling me into a false sense of security.
Aww yiss umaru season 2.
Wasnt sure if you were looking forward to that or not when I saw the trailer v.
I cant fair for the next season of hamsterposting.
You are not the first one who mentioned that I should mention.
I hope Alice to zouroku does turn out to be more light hearted than I dread.
Well so far attack on tighten season 2 is doing much the same as season 1.
Dudes be dyin' levi be fangirl-baitin' and for every slight revelation of storyline 50 more questions are asked.
Four year time lag doesn't help.
What's the significance of these place names again?
Is this the first time we're meeting this character?
Has this character shown in flashbacks died in the present yet?
Do I even really care about any of this anymore.
You know the whole poeple turning into titans things isn't that shocked at this point can we hurry it up.
They're being massive teases with The Key right in the fucking OP it's genius.
Do they finally have an OP thats not a call and response done utterly wrong ?
Judge for yourself.
It's the same guys as the last two so it's very more of the same.
Well it doens't have german so i guess they couldn't fuck up the german.
Wait was that a bunch of dinosaurs.
Why was there a bunch of dinosaurs.
I really don't fucking have a clue.
Grimdark depressing futurepast?
And yes having found ! can confirm no gratuitous german in the lyrics.
> catching up on brave witches.
> character takes entire bottle of red wine to herself and takes it with her inside a sauna.
You sure she isn't finnish?
Yeah but drinking in a sauna.
She's either russian or finnish.
She's not the finnish one think she's russian maybe?
Okay german in fact.
Maybe she's half finnish half french.
She wants to drink the sauna but she'll drink wine damnit.
With a character name like krupinski that's a weird half french/finn.
Do you expect complexity from a show about furries shooting alien mecha?
I was going to make that joke but then I got distracted v.
BwaS just because furries are shooting alien mecha doesn't mean your show can't have some depth in the downtime.
I've been invited to vote for my employer's pension scheme's newest trustee.
Because I'm enrolled and that's apparently how it works.
The 6 candidates include 2 women and 4 men one of the latter being called Cyril.
Sure is England in here.
Do you dislike cyrils or something ?
S'just a quintessentially English name.
He also either has a double-barrelled family name or a middle name he actively uses by default.
Either of which combined with the name Cyril places him quite definitely in the upper classes.
That or very aspirational middle class!
The middle class covers like >80% of the population.
Does it though?
Anathema if class is purely self-described yes.
Omg my LRT tho.
Via Smurf obvs.
The dumb piracy joke one ?
MairBear the dumbest thing has been said in VLR so far All right I trust you.
Vegeta's Last Rising?
Virtues Last Reward.
Its a VN i think.
Also yes VN with puzzles.
DH feels weird to level having not played range since... before seasons existed.
I think since RoS launch in fact.
And that was wizard.
I dont think I have ever actually finished RoS properly.
Doesn't help that they are fairly late bloomers in aoe.
Maybe I should do that one of these days.
MairBear I'm like 21 22.
I have multishot but it's so expensive.
They're better than they sound as long as you don't pick the rune that makes them a shitty aura.
I wish there was a good chakrams build.
They are fun.
There's weapon and quiver for it!
I wonder if it would be a good ancients only non set option.
Oh dear game over to a pack of mobs in P5 because they decided to all just bum rush the main character.
They're getting smarter.
No Aigis successor to protect you?
Obv my fault for not having a physical immunity.
Not yet at least? And if they have the Yousuke will now DIE FOR YOU in this game i've not unlocked it yet.
That day was the day Yousuke was finally useful.
MairBear STEALTHOSAUR.
I'm going to assume that Yōsuke is 4's Aigis.
No he's not nearly as cool.
MoonWolf that parrot is Determined af tho.
It can carry you over small streams.
Noelor its secretly a protagonist.
MairBear more important party composition question do you have the cat yet.
Damnit brodebot has exactly 199 followers and its bothering me.
The Not-Teddy is amazing.
Does not!teddy make terrible puns ?
Thank the anime gods.
In fact there's not been any punitive punners so far.
Are you sure you're playing the right game?
Maybe all the puns are spoilers and MairBear can't talk about them because of the atlus spoiler police.
MoonWolf that count should be fixed.
I thought you were already following it.
I meaaan Atlus Spoiler Police plus just not wanting to ruin anything about the game for anyone xD.
I just asked my Friend to follow.
Thanks noelors friend.
Why does brodebot not follow you?
Well if in the list of followers there is one person that clearly sticks out that means i'm clearly the gu in charge and while i have no problem with being the person in charge of brodebot.
I also don't want 200 random followers.
Suppose you've got your github linked there.
Which is more appropes for contact on that anyway.
I don't suppose anyone is bored enough to find me that screenshot comic from Smash 3 Brawl? of Snake telling Peach and Zelda that girls can kiss each other?
I have no idea of what you are talking about but challenge accepted.
I found it on GameFAQs.
I just found it.
This is a good edit.
Congratulations on finding it without prior knowledge tho.
Incidentally needed it as a response to.
Sorry don't have a reply to that that isn't lewd.
I can't believe murloc paladin is fucking deaf.
Shamans are the new murloc deck.
They have a quest and a legendary minion besides.
Though i think neptulon is wild now.
MoonWolf aware of ?
No reply?gotcha covered.
MoonWolf I thought shaman's tribe this xpac was elemental?
Its shamans they get all the blizzard love.
They got a new tribe and murlocs and also more support for midrange.
Welp I'm sold.
But is it loki's fault.
Did it just Record scratch at the start v.
That was a very Orcy Hulk.
Subject of unjust profiling obviously.
Look at thor has to do is remind hulk how fun it was to punch loki's face in.
And then suggest that punching hel in the face would be just as fun.
And there you go.
Former writer / developer at WW/OPP currently airing dirty laundry.
Noelor basics they're a game company in rpg's and they pay peole like those companies always have.
Badly and not on time.
Which i guess is news for some but not for me.
So not really dirty laundry at all.
They pay worse than other rpg companies and dick people around worse.
That seems very difficult to disprove.
Holden joined in.
Shame its a messy clusterfuck to read thanks to Twitter layout.
I was sitting in a meeting earlier today staring at the duckpond outside and I got inspired to try and write a martial art that is as cruel as Crane is compassionate and call it Heron Style.
Although I am pretty sure CGL is worse than WW from what I've heard. Especially considering they still have the guy who scammed them almost into bankruptcy as an employee v.
Anathema New low in the kitchen.
80% sure someone spat their chewing gum out into the sink.
I did not check its consistency to be absolutely sure.
That is what we call a bug.
Haven't even clicked link.
How is one card this buggy.
The first shadow visions bug isn't actually in any way a bug.
It is rather an unfortunate fact of life that animations take turn time and the slush time blizzard awards isn't enough.
This one though.
This is a bug.
For goodness sake xD.
Noelor | I just got back from the kitchen where people hid piled dirty cups on the counter instead of putting them in the dish washer literally 2 feet from the cup.
That makes more sense than secret dirty dishes out in the open.
That was a typo but also sorta closer to how a glaswegian would say it.
Lets see if this SU covers playlist on spotify is any good.
This Stronger Than You doesn't evne have vocals.
It's a metal guy though.
THIS FEELS WRONG.
Ska cali brat vocals.
Anathema not as good as the SU originals playlist on SoundCloud.
Which is on the actual account of the show's musicians.
Is there one of just the vocal tracks?
Idk probs not.
Does spotify have nier music ?
Not the ost.
I'm surprised it has stuff like amateur cover playlists.
Thought it was just commercial?
People can fairly easily put their own stuff up I think.
Titan confirmed guyz.
Sc2's not dead okay it's just reached its balance potential.
Doesn't need david kim anymore.
Didn't expect that.
Normal skincolour widowmaker.
Beep boop fuck the blue team.
I know a couple who will go bonkers over the Genji skin at least.
Well I've got like the HotS one the glorious Nihon one and I think a recent drop of Sandpit Genji so I'm fine.
I don't need genji skins.
On account of bad at genji.
Oh for fucks sake I am going to have to reinstall aint I.
You can shoot robots now.
Its in french so its hard to tell.
Surely someone here can read french.
Noelor hasn't said much in the last 3 hours.
There is a overwatch video but its french.
I am probably not fluent enough.
Fluentify with haste.
Has reddit or whoever not translated it yet?
I would have to check reddit for that.
Reddit is a scary place.
It's okay I have a french-canadian friend screaming about it on Skype instead about how awful the voices are v.
Just tell them it's EuroFrench P.
No Proper french.
I mean implicitly yes.
Yes but yours was too subtle I feel.
His main complain was that it sounded tryhard and kinda fren-glish.
If all the skins were shown in that video I think the only one I might want is the genji one.
Like tracer's speaking french but she's speaking it too much like she's english?
Since I did not get the glorious nippon one.
Dob Too much english words sprinkled through it.
Par for the course for foreigners online.
<- reins amazing hair poster.
That had better be a rein skin.
Well the content suggests a quartet of rein mercy tracer torb in blue OW gear like the DLC 76 skin.
Yeah all those skins are bad.
But there was at least a legendary...torb? skin shown as well.
But then the clip also shows a different torb one so I dunno how deep they'd go.
Gotta go... DEEPER *inception roars*.
I guess there's kinda the two Eichenwalde ones for Crusader-Reinhardt.
Anyone want a free full-body shudder?
MairBear i feel i'm owed money for that.
You can have 80g when I next get that one quest.
Y'all I am well into that Mercy skin tho.
Noelor my subscriber count on brodebot is 203 now so i need you to find 3 friends and or Friends to unsub now. thnx.
Noelor and their Harem.
A I do not have a harem.
B I have only one acquaintance of any level who I know is subscribed and is not in this channel.
I know you don't that was the joke.
MoonWolf This makes me happier than it should.
Grmbl mairs gone I wanted to talk about my latest crazy theory in this game.
GlennCuddlefish theory everyone is an asshole.
!note Noelor so there are costume DLC packs for p5. The p3 one offers the cat Aigis' outfit. D.
Noelor Lady Prestor.
Malcom Furion and Ellie Dan Stormrage.
Pretty sure Varian Wrynn works without change.
These are becoming less like names P.
Ghul Dan Part turkish.
Allie Dan's parents were like we picked a girls name and a boys a name and we're just going to give you both and then you figure it out.
Ragnar is a name yo.
Is it tho.
Yes it is.
One of my old guildies was called Ragnar. I think he was Faeroese...
Would that thought it was a nordic name.
The Faroe islands is located between Norway and Iceland and belong to Denmark so yes it is a Nordic name =P.
Antonym of unique?
Ragnar is more Scandinavian than Finno-Ugric name.
Noelor it gets tricky.
Was v unsure what to do with Estonian.
Yeah Estonian is a really interesting region as they have a lot of things from both Nordics Russia and Slavic areas.
A melting pot.
Because iirc it's the one other Finnic language?
But like Finland yeah far from uninfluenced by it's neighbours.
Finno-Ugric might be the correct term need to verify if that's still the case.
They say in fucking English of all languages.
Finnic or Baltic Finnic includes Finnish Karelian Ludic Veps Ingrian Votic Estonian and Livonian.
So yes you're correct.
Noelor I remembered 'duplicate' is a word naming functions is hard.
MairBear I hate it when this happens. I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out this stupid gold locker finally gave up and went to check the solution.Turns out I had it right but I had just mangled the input multiple times.
I think of all the times I gave up in a fuckdishit only once was I totally on the wrong track.
Also at least one of my theories was proven only half right.
But now I have new half brained theories.
MoonWolf see discord.
Noelor what is your discord O.
Also I take it people have seen the Mei nendo by now.
Still no Mercy or Pharah.
Omg that Meindoroid.
GlennCuddlefish i found some uhm spheres shall we say in the desert.
Also i finally ran out of sidequests and started on the forest.
FOR THE FOREST KIIIIING.
There's pharah pop figures... that kinda counts.
Funkos are trash.
I never actually saw those spheres in the desert until I started doing the sidequest related to them.
I was exploring the desert more because another sidequest showed me there was stuff beyond the wind wall.
So i figured there might be more to find.
And lo and behold.
There was a weird thing.
Oh my god the snowball D It's too precious.
I don't get why blizzard is doing funko's and nendo's.
You'd think they'd stick to one.
Kind of different markets.
Some are for people who would like a good product and some are for gamestop customers with no taste.
To be clear though the latter is funkos right?
Nobody here is going to try to claim funkos are good?
Hold on I'll answer that once I figure out a way how to weave insulting HotS players into this.
I'm preemtivly declaring myself neural in the funko-nendo wars.
Ah so you are one of those people who have trash taste but want to feel smug about it as well.
Would that I could afford nendos though c.
GlennCuddlefish no i literally don't want to get involved.
I have no anime latex figures of any kind.
Neither do I but you can tell with a glance that one of them is..less good.
I have two... an Agnes figure that came with Bravely Second CE. And a mini-squid girl I couldn't resist when abroad.
And they're hardly worthy of being called nendo's but they're close.
Only anime figurine I have is an EVA 00 one.
I've got two Nendos of the main character for Space Pirates and Miku and one figurine of the Major.
The opening line of the Description... ouch.
Plz no crychyroll.
I'd have prefered another lewd waifu over this.
Have a wise wolf then.
Holy shit the savings!
1% cheaper than buying it in the flesh!
Those cents add up MairBear.
Yeh the CR store discounting is pretty trash.
Also shipping from US.
Also practically everything up there is 'pre-order for something not released for 6 months and we've already sold out our allocation'.
Less allocation than Nintendo gave for the NES tthing.
Still no new steven? C.
SU schedule remains a mystery no mortal may understand.
Who do we blame though?
At least Gravity Falls let us shake our fist and mutter Disney.
Maybe we can blame french leaks ?
Those plumbers are trying.
I'm good at words shut up.
Oh dear the hearthstone global games just referred to the paladin quest as 'the last cally dozer'.
Clearly i should have been watching this for the terrible commenary.
Are they intentionally being bad at words or something ?
Well it was the polish caster so I think just second language problems.
What's the actual word?
Kal ei do saur.
Not technially a collectible card.
Hearthstone now has spells you play that grant you quests?
Its a 5 mana 5/5 that adapts 5 times.
Anathema eh sort of.
So the idea behind quests is that they are 1 mana spells that are always in your opening hand you can mulligan them away.
Is Questing Adventurer still in standard tho?
There is in fact an archetype called Questing Rogue.
Not to be confused by Quest Rogue.
Thats all about making giant minions by casting a lot of spells.
Right because rogue.
Yeah beause if any class is good at casting a very large amount of cheap spells its rogue.
That rogue just more goes by Miracle though.
Sure its a miracle deck.
But it runs questing adventurer and van cleef as serious threats.
Miracle is the wider category here.
Instead of malygoss or charge finishers.
Did rogue lose any of its coin generators to wild?
It lost tomb pillager.
But still has the actual coin cards.
!hs tomb pillager.
Oh sure but still has Gally and uh...
The 2/2 that gives you a coin when you hit opponents face.
I forgot the name.
Or was Gally coins for the other guy...
Gallywix was the gvg legendary.
Gallywix gives you a spell and gives them a coin.
That was GvG?
Oh brawls are wild.
Gives the spell cast to the opposing player gives a coin to the caster.
Cutpurse TGT so wild as well now.
But nobody plays those.
Cutpurse some saw play.
Pillager was almost an autoinclude.
Counterfeit coins are definitly in all miracle decks.
So they mostly just lost burgler.
Which is a shame.
But doens't kill the deck since they were mostly just coin neutral.
You could coin one on turn 3 for free.
Since you'd get that coin back.
The only time I've played rogue that I can remember was the season shift brawl.
Which was all the coins forever.
And it was great.
My rogue deck was a n'zoth deck.
I'm not good at miracle.
But burglars were great in n'zoth.
Since they are beefy.
I put the auctioneer package in my rogue decks but no questing/vancleef.
That is not a release date that I had expected.
Herding cats is hard work MoonWolf. D.
!note Noelor Pickerod Blade is actually a real cool card idea tho <- I thought so.
Uprising is live btw.
Beat me to it ca <.
But this time not in french!
Hon hon hon.
My overwatch is indeed updating.
Hey there it's Jeff from the Omnicwatch team?
That dva highlight intro is amaze.
8 skins of 10 legendary ouch.
And how many of those are worth it.
And a player icon.
Living that lootbox life.
I'll comment once this thing actually downloads.
Is it a vs bots thing or pvp?
4 heroes vs ai.
Ok can we get 4 players here?
I'm here mairs here your here BwaS.
Ok good lets do this.
Well in a few minutes once my patch downloads.
And how does that go.
Everyone Get In Here.
Mumble up bwas.
Never put that on here but okay.
Maybeshewill I think.
MoonWolf Hemet combo discovered.
Via rage orc nothing but 3 mana cards. Holy Wrath and Molten Giant.
My Friend just described me as like a gay forest.
Which is the most confusing compliment I've ever received probably.
Also I just accidentally hit a keyboard shortcut to deactivate one of my monitors.
I think being AltGr+F8.
Oh my god I have some sort of special case of dumb this morning.
So here I was doing one of those puzzles that requires you to figure out a bunch of weights with a scale.
So I put the thingymajigs on the scale thing A goes down thing B goes up.
I mark this as A<B.
Repeat 4 times then spend 30 minutes cursing at a puzzle why wont it work.
I'm sorry friend.
Noelor I'm laughing at the like a gay forest.
That's so random.
That is fair.
Noelor did you hear the new mercy line? Well lines but only one is of note..
Had to find it for exact phrasing but Sometimes I'm not sure why I even bother.
Now we're just missing a surprising amount of damage line.
Do people need help with getting their sprays?
I probably will.
Lemme know when you want it then.
Wanna do it soon glenn? Got a good time to pause in P5.
Sure let me see if I got betrayed again first.
MoonWolf anime hell archive has started to get uploaded to youtube currently unlisted.
Already watched it live.
No need ot watch it again.
I missed it live.
Which is a bit of a shame but otoh it's going up in manageable chunks.
Just had a round of Uprising with me as Torb solo support S.
Torb gets a lot of armor to throw around but its no healer.
Kain_Spoo so route B not a big fan of the only having one weapon and shit combos thing. hackings a nice minigame but i don't want it to be the primary way to fight.
Fun fact you have pontentially the best melee combos in route b.
Well not on the weapons i have upgraded.
You can do a melee heavy attack by delaying.
Oh thats good to know.
More color practise.
's not bad.
Lineart once again not mine I still suck at doing that.
GlennCuttlefish shadows man amirite?
Attempt at empathetic sounds about how shading things and placing the shadows is.
Ah. yes. I actually like shading and coloring but I am still not sure I am doing it at all right.
But I think my biggest problem so far has been that I overdo the shadows.
GlennCuttlefish why are pugs so bad at robot murdering.
Why do you think there's an Omnic Crisis in quickmatch these days?
You know what they should do.
They should take the names of people who have been banned for botting.
And use them for omnic names.
Even omnic terrorists don't want to be running around King's Row calling themselves JewWhore #4392.
At least I finished the win normal uprising as all 4 heroes.
So I can stop being bad at tracer and leave her for someone who can play her.
Got that one done about halfway through 'play all heroes version as 8 different'.
I linked to discord received very good question.
634 PM Fae are those four small burgers inside a regular bun or regular burgers in a very large bun.
Scale makes me think its the first.
MoonWolf for some reason playing Diablo makes youtube freeze.
That is weird.
Try setting it to fullscreen window mode ?
Play civ instead.
Actually that's a lie I'm going to go get food.
But after that.
Is there anything behind that?
Or is it just wind up toys falling off a desk?
Its a nier automata thing.
MairBear how interested are you in hearing me rant about whatever bullshit that game throws at me during the final path?
Quite interested. But also time is getting late D.
Ok. I can finish it tomorrow then.
In a horrible hangover.
Want me to listen for what time I do have to your ranting and just get it done instead? xD.
Nah Im fine with waiting until tomorrow.
I can catch up on anime and stuff instead today.
Apparently its snowing in Stockholm according to a friend.
Tavern brawl pack mouseover 4 common 1 epic come on doomsayer!
> ancient of war.
Gotta love it when you have a 0 death game on heroes brawl and ppl on your team go up to 14.
Hmm not bad.
It's a bit last starfighter -y.
Watching hearthstone tournament.
MairBear did you vote ?
I voted for canada.
MoonWolf I forgot.
Or didn't see rather.
I think you still can ?
But all these casters saying Yassharaj is upsetting.
These casters have been terrible all tournament.
I'm not kidding.
They are bad.
I know it's meant to be Yah Sha Raj or so I'm told which still upsets me given the spelling. But there's an h in there. Damnit.
H's are often silent.
Not following an s or a t though C.
Still either do it right or do it intentionally wrong like Day 9 does with Why Shuh Arr Jay.
Persona 4 day change STAB THE DAY.
Don't stab my days D.
They're short enough as is.
Sojiro I don't trust you or like you. Now you're in charge of my sign. Don't ask my logic behind this. You're sign boy now.
And keep away from my coffee >.
MoonWolf watching an LP of it?
Also holy shit you need to manually go to school by switch trains.
It's p great but you get shortcut hotkeys after tutorial month if not earlier.
MairBear holy shit that gym teachers jaw in animeland is isnane.
Would you share a link? Probably watching that passively would be more fun than listening to the current PlayHS stream x.
Holy shit p5 lp has softbank commercials too!
Just the one.
MairBear with out without talking over cutscenes ?
Whichever. Unless they do awkward silly voices for all the unvoiced lines >.>'.
They do not.
MoonWolf Aww they didn't say no to that first choice.
Look its clearly a but thou must.
If you say no it actyually restarts the game on you though.
That counts as an ending speedrun lp.
I think it did the credits too maybe but I might be confusing that with something else. With amusing dialogue from the voice telling you that you shouldn't play any games if you're that serious.
WELP turn 3 loss to a mage.
Who played manawyrm turn 1 wrym arcane missiles turn 2 and I had nothing I could put on the board x.
Sometimes you just draw bad.
Oh boy... it's gonna be one of these days c.
Decks curving a perfect and agressive curve. Me never quite stabilising.
Hate those aggro mages wyrm coin image is another pet hate of mine.
Aye but if you get that start and no response in your hand you can be freeze/control and still just agro down.
Space Lesbian Robots.
Do go on.
Just Nier 2 implications.
Well maybe humanity should have designed more than one line of units that are men for yorha.
MoonWolf I'm a fan of the skill categories for D3's Necro.
I've actually not looked at them yet.
What are they ?
In that they have Blood Bone Reanimation AND just Corpses.
In addition to Curses and Primary/Secondary.
Their mana seems to be called Essence because why not.
Bone Armour... Rip bones from nearby enemies dealing damage and create armour that reduces damage taken.
You used to just make some bones.
Now you STEAL BONES.
Command Skeletons just passively raises a skeleton for you every 2 seconds until you hit the cap.
Lol witchdoctors need a passive for that and to kill stuff.
Necros just get them.
Just sort of happen.
Curse of Frailty has an Aura run.
The radius of the aura is affected by your gold pickup radius bonus.
Passive Your minions gain 200% of your Thorns second class with Thorns build!
Make it happen!
Look steam i know i have been playing nier automata recently and yes that has a female protagonist. that doesn't mean you should recommend me every game with a female protagonist tag.
Thats not how that works.
Also never recommend me lightning returns ever again.
It's calmed down a bit now.
Whats calmed down ?
But when I played Zero Time Dilemma it did nothing but recommend visual novels for over a week.
And before that it was stuck on pixel graphics roguelikes.
Because that's why I played Necrodancer right? For the pixel graphics?
Got the craziest mirror going on.
Playing the 'warrior class cards' bullshit lowest curve ever questing deck.
Opponent Im pretty sure on the 8+ mana or more as druid.
So kill him before he overwhelms you.
Oh he already did.
I was playing my quest deathrattle n'zoth priest in wild earlier today.
And ran into a n'zoth mage.
That was weird.
Well whadya know my single of 'explore ungoro' 2nd last card in the deck.
And yeh I had the 'win as warrior' for 40 q that I was intentionally avoiding completing.
Would people be up for doing overwatch chievos today?
I can cheevo some cheeves.
I cheevo some cans too.
I have lunch in ~25 mins though so time to do one or two attempts if you're around and then can pick up again after.
How achieving were you looking to be?
Normal uprising at least on hard mode for you two maybe try getting the 80% chievo on the side.
If we can win that higher difficulties.
To paraphrase the Innkeeper. WAaaaugh Legendary!
Did you just get a drop or talking the achi?
Yeh that one aint happening Hard was enough for me.
I think we could do at least one up from hard mode with you helping.
Hotform's playing vs an ungoro questing rogue.
Who added doomsayers to their deck.
Riverdale is far better than it has any right to be btw.
GlennCuttlefish this is glorious.
Especially the race quests part.
P4 OTP.
Just what heroes fucking needed another broken melee assassin.
We don't need supports or tanks.
Just endless assassins.
Or assassins that can be mediocre tanks some of the time.
Lol blackwatch genji zarya.
Skins are getting weird and very meta.
God I haven't missed hero league.
We got a 5 man team wipe at level 20+.
Better go take our bruiser camp and wait to push keeps!
Nice all 5 craft sequence books are £7 for kindle atm as in 5 books for £7 not each.
Seemxs like a good deal.
MairBear how do you feel about winning a game of hearthstone so i can have some dust ?
Noelor there is more CLAMP does magical girls in car land.
Ft the Panzerest Panzerskank.
MoonWolf kaaay.
Omg that opening section.
Its pretty good.
Really curious where the sprite scame form.
Gonna just guess Panzer.
Omg the talking about paldrons bit he actually has indoril pauldrons.
MoonWolf yeah I bought them without a second thought been meaning to pick them up after I finished the Expanse.
Umi continues to live in alternate kinkier car-land.
Don't fuck a giraffe Umi.
Noelor thats what she concluded too.
Getting an enviro kill on a lucio as pharah giving me a crisis of reality.
Its a commonly known fact that lucio's are the natural predator of the pharah.
I have dpstanky videos to prove it.
...what the shit game.
Noelor it was pretty dumb!
Man fuck dpstanky the shit he pulls off.
Yeah let's just climb ilios windmill from a standing start do it with 6 red 76's dropping tac visor on me and have me reach the top w/o dying.
Why are there ghost twins now ?
Sure why not.
Also going by ending B my path A 9s was seriously slacking off.
Any fight with a large amount of bots should have just been a sequence of bots exploding for no reason while 2B was trying to run at them.
Why do I ask internet for drawing suggestions.
GlennCuttlefish i have no clue.
Why do you.
Well its good practise for one I guess.
I need an Exalted namelist mod for Stellaris. I may have to make one.
Can't be that hard to make.
No getting the names is the hardest I guess.
Doesn't feature Akko being incompetent at anything 7/10. try harder.
Sucie could be creepier but otherwise perfect.
Someone in the LP Diablo thread describing D3's protagonist as a fully 3D murder god.
Yeah checks out.
Yeah thats about accurate.
Noelor> apologies in advance for my feed probably going a bit politics-y next couple months P.
!note Noelor same apology as BwaS.
Have fun with that v.
Just because your country isn't imploding doesn't mean you get to gloat p.
Oh don't worry. We've got election soon.
On the plus side I barely follow any swedes so =p.
MoonWolf BrodeBot making more instant classics I see.
I had to include it because it both perfectly good english and utter nonsese as a card.
Oh boy its one of those games.
What is ?
Our team has 2 tanks that keep just charging in and blaming me for dying.
But I'm not even playing.
Oh the life of mercy main.
50% damage healed and not even a simple thanks.
Sometimes I'm not sure why I even bother.
I never thank myself in public games either.
Its a joke how i'm a support main get it ?
Hey hitting c on the keyboard and mousing up to the top left is a lot of APM to do in quickmatch okay?
Once i managed to walk diagonally backwards while shooting that was a personal peak of simultanious actions.
So that's why you managed gold in competitive.
Teach me your ways.
Okay this is important so you're going to want to pay attention. Try to only join games where you don't have terrible people on your team.
Its a bit like mulliganing for a specific card in hearthstone.
Your going to want to master that skill.
Well you know from experience how shit my mulligans go so I guess I'll have to live with the bronze life.
One of these days I will clear up a lot of space on my HD. and then I will record a hour of me playing double action boogaloo.
And then a hour of me playing overwatch as anything but mercy.
To what end ?
And make a comparison video. For DAB sections I will use some frentic eurobeat music.
For the overwatch sections groose's theme.
Okay i get that compared to action sliding adventure that overwatch is a little slower.
Well mostly to amuse myself. I also have considered making a video of me playing DBA at some point since when I actually try watching what I am doing I am not believing the bullshit I pull off in that game.
But its not THAT slow.
Yeah but my aim in overwatch is a LOT worse.
Hearthstone really wants me to keep playing murloc rogue it seems.
Its a weird deck your opponent will never see it coming.
Like that week i played murloc priest a few years ago.
Most friendrequests i'd ever had.
Opponents that thank when you play coldlight.
Still upsetting xD.
That was bullshit win there xD.
Murloc Tidecaller end turn 2 murloc Tidehunter -> shadowstep -> tidehunter -> tinyfin. End turn 3 murloc warleader.
Anathema how long until game again?
Just over 2 hours.
3-0 in arena turned into 3-3 in arena because fuck me D.
Did brodebot actually make up a name with functional grammar for once?
Sure looks like it.
Its actually because i made a better brain.
<- this is brodebots current cardqueu ordered by newest card as you can probably see its gotten better at names.
MoonWolf hey MoonWolf.
I got a parcel today.
Noelor hey Noelor?
After only 3 years 10 months.
Exalted 3rd Edition is physically in my hands.
Is it big and golden and full of charms ?
With the pages printed upside down?
At least two of those!
BwaS if they were *all* upside down it'd be fine tbf.
Oh also did you see the pic I linked from Dan Shive's tumblr?
Ah yeah i did.
I said a thing about it.
I must have timed out.
2017-04-19 003912 MoonWolf logged in 6 seconds ago <- damnit dan just do the thing.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish.
MairBear retort from discord.
The real way to break the combat system self destruct cancelling.
My brother and I are discussing relationships.
Turns out he's sleeping with someone called *Aurora*.
And I'm somewhat jealous.
Noelor your brother knows how to pick 'em.
Although with that name one only wonders how much crazy lies beneath the surface.
MoonWolf didnt know you can use it to repeat enders.
GlennCuttlefish turns out you totally can.
So have fun chain overhead slamming.
Thing is I am either playing on normal where i dont need it.
Or I am playing on hard where it would be too distracting what with dying to one hit.
Well not always but boss fights.
Also if I start a new save since level scaling is not a thing in this game and I am 99 now.
GlennCuttlefish i thought you were making a new save file for japanese voices anyway ?
Yeah I am at some point.
Jade gets a british I think co-commentator is somehow shocked when puns appear.
Shen why are you so expensive to upgrade.
Come on now.
He's not that expensive compared to the blacksmith.
He is for the last level at least.
What British co-commentator? I mean that's obviously Guava who took time off from watching hockey I.
Sorry let me rephrase.
Guava is british for a week Jade somehow surprised when puns are included.
Oh god.
I mean it would've been hilarious if it had been HBO but it being Sony it'll just be kinda sad.
LWA certainly is a trigger show. 13 episodes in the main character is starting to get their shit together and a mysterious new probably villain appears.
My prediction will be 7 episodes of akko failing and then 4 episodes of madness.
1 episode of maybe Akko and Diana could maybe be friends forgotten the episode after.
Nah thats not the trigger method.
In fact its more likely they will be the star team in the end.
Much more likely yeah.
The internet for now.
Cannot deal with less than 6 hours sleep so glad I took today off work.
Didn't you just have a long relaxing weekend ?
Last weekend wasn't relaxing for me.
I ate food now I'm nauseous stupid human body.
Damn it Tyreal stop overeating >v.
<- you thought spirit claws was annoying welcome to spirit claws big brother shadowing shout.
It gets +2 attack when you cast a spell.
On a weapon because balance.
MairBear enjoy the great new brawl.
Also known as the terribly unbalance nofun brawl.
I am not sure what this tells me about my mercy skills.
After 46 hours I finally got the huge rez achievement.
So either I am really terrible at using ultis.
Or just a master of keeping people alive.
For me it's being good at dying first when a team kill is about to happen. C.
MoonWolf I know you don't do the does this make sense ranking thing RoboRosewater does with its pics.
I'm hearing a but.
But Shadowing Shout is decidedly congruent and... balanced?
Its... balanced in that the numbers sort of match.
Its not balanced in practice.
But its a card i could see existing.
It'd get feedback in the form of wtf were you thinking though.
MoonWolf turns out my friend is a Dutch sympathiser.
He needs saté saus or curry saus with that.
Damn new autocorrect.
I aprove of your Friend now.
They're happy with this.
MoonWolf my opinions on LWA were it was pretty good and I should watch the full series if I'm ever in an anime mood and have finished Jojo Utena and Sailor Moon.
Spo 5 years from now at the earliest.
Maybe even 5 Trigger serieses from now.
Problem with the full version LWA was no-one was running it unless it's gonna be on 'flix later in the year or something.
So here I was trying to heal in overwatch.
And then I heard the magic words that magically switch me to tracer or something useless I need practise with.
Its just QP XD.
Its a poewrful magic indeed.
Tbh I have a bit of that mentality in it.
I still enjoy you know.
Ppl want rational comps and 100% commitment competitive is thattaway.
Sure its fine to have a bit of that mentality.
But when people are purposefully playing to lose.
Do you guys remember last week my Friend called me a gay forest?
They got me a birthday card with a portrait of me on it.
Noelor btw if you ever feel like reading 100k+ words of slightly unusual but good sailor moon fanfic hit me up.
Why is there a winston in my team every round now.
All I wanted was chill healing but noo.
I have to worry about suicidal apes instead.
Just don't heal the scientist.
Why are you even asking that of course that's my jam.
Earthscorpion also does unofficial additional chapters a forum where it gets posted with the chapter as played as a tabletop rpg.
Wait you never hung out in #exalted.
Some guy who co-writes with the author*.
Its 4 years old anathema.
GlennCuttlefish> endemic genjis/widows/tracers and people looking for a counter.
And maybe testing the 'oh we buffed his shield cd'.
Has 18 chapters so 10k words a chapter which is. not insane really.
As in less then.
I words good.
Tbh I worry less about healing bad tracers and genjis than winstons.
Best case scenario with winston is they survive and I hve to spend 10 seconds getting them back up.
With flankers either they die and its not my problem or I can get them to speed in a second.
Thats fair enough.
I mean its good ulti but even so I would rather spend time healing useful people instead of a bouncy target balloon.
Gonna buy this purely based on this promo video.
Wonder if you can get anything out of it if you have no understanding of music theory.
Anathema i guess. if thats a ting you're into.
GlennCuttlefish yeah it doesn't rely on any existing knowledge just having ears.
Pretty sure I'm getting this wrong more often than I'm getting it right.
Episode 14 of LWA New intro and a suspicious kamina looking professor appears. Still on trigger track.
Also this series that came out before I put my ideas down but that I had not seen until now is totes stealing my ideas.
Important bug fixes.
The Ashtongue Felsmith has become aware of his burning region and is no longer standing in his forge at Deliverance Point.
Preface. Due to shenanigans druid has two 7/1s after damage. Priest has two 5/5s a 3/4 taunt. Priest has two SWDs. Druid on his last legs.
Caster spends 5 mins talking about how if the druid has deathwing he can buy a turn. Clear board etc. Priest uses one death on a 7/1 and lets the other trade into the taunt.
Caster then seems surprised the priest didn't needlessly use his second death... after talking of how a deathwing is the only thing that can change the game now.
No deathwing came druid lost but it takes a special level of caster to be that oblivious of their own words I guess xP.
!note MairBear Caster spends 5 mins talking about how if the druid has deathwing he can buy a turn. Clear board etc. Priest uses one death on a 7/1 and lets the other trade into the taunt. <- the most obviously good play.
Noelor THE BACKGROUND CHARACTERS ARE IN ON IT.
Ah moonlingo. Could you at least give me an explanation of it before I go and mangle it with google translate.
Its become as gods in moonrunes.
More heroic spirits than you ever wanted to know about.
MoonWolf no idea what you're talking about P.
Oh no the change blindless has gotten to you too.
!note MairBear <- chinese trolden is great.
Either our ana was really bad or my team was just about the best healed team ever.
I had 45% damage taken healed.
GlennCuttlefish I've realized something about 2B.
2B loves sidequests.
9S complains about them A2 gives you a way to rudely decline most of them.
2B just fucking does all of them.
Beats killing endless waves of robots.
Ah drat the last song isn't up on YT. Apparently a new track with David Hasselhoff.
They really are going all in on their music gimmick.
Well yes the music is a big part of the movies.
Go big or keep going till everyone tells you to go home.
MoonWolf great D.
Goddamnit soon I will have all the event skins I dont want.
And none of the ones I do.
The shit firefox why are you updating without permission again.
Jeff hates your personally.
Ruined your droprates.
I wish I can get one of them before the event ends.
I can live with not having one and I can afford one.
Well this proves it.
On my enemy team there is joy.
In my team depression.
I have not seen that easy a victory in ages.
Clearly you should type kys in team chat to send them over the edge.
Nah that was the best reaper I have seen in ages.
In case it was in doubt.
Trump hovering over an earth elemental vs midrange murloc pally.
Ohmygosh please don't be repentance.
MoonWolf finished the priest quest in Tavern Brawl vs a rogue.
Used reward at 13 hp.... his response Ewww 8/8 taunt better sap it.
Uh........ okay ty xD.
I just shared a moment as dinomancer hunter vs dinomancer hunter. I played out my lost turn so I did the honorable thing buffed his minion Well played. And ended.
We then went back and forward not attacking just buffing his minion up to 78 attack. Because you can use it on enemy beasts too. And I managed to telegraph freeze trap well enough for him to Adapt it 4 times D.
Cute dog but he's dumber 'n a bag of rocks.
MoonWolf the fuck happened with Moro Time walker Lights worn?
I hve NO IDEA.
But i like it!
It's the triple e.
Plus there are at least 3 pretty good cards.
Really need to see the pool of preeety good cars.
Well sadly neural networks don't give you the extra cards.
MairBear the triple I'd guess is from such things as charrrge.
One important thing to remember is that i cherry pick cards quite a bit.
I skip a lot of boring cards.
And utterly nonsenical ones that are not funny.
Nobody wants to see the 4 mana 4/4 with taunt.
Unless it's called something funny of course.
Or a shaman spell 4 mana 5 damage overload 2.
Oh I didn't actually realise you were curating.
Noelor this is about 2/3's of the last set of cards i generated.
Most of those are not stuff i want to post.
Yeah it's fair.
I just hadn't thought about it.
Nobody wants to follow somewhat okay hearthstone cards bot.
Damn I thought that said Bunniest not Buennist.
Also nobody wants to see existing card with 1 thing different and the wrong name.
And it makes a lot of those.
Then why did they produce Mimic Pod?
I should catch up on SU at some point.
I am like a season behind at this point.
Well you have a dozen years till the next ep.
If someone told me Persona was essentially Pokémon meets Inception I would have played it waaay sooner. Pffft.
Fuck you water also puti.
Started my second playthrough of nier. finally found the launcher.
The launcher ?
You know move that knocks enemies in the air.
How the fuck did you even get to some chests.
If you didn't know how to do that.
You had to launch enemies for some chests?
No the launcher move gets you a higher initial jump than a regular jump but only counts as your first jump for airtime rules.
You can also use it instead of a regular jump after a dash.
Mad skill? Either that or I missed some chests.
Grmbl I have to open all the bazillion factory shortcuts again.
Anathema I'm not sure it's supposed to be that much faster.
Anathema at least the metal mesh should be close to a paper filter although it lets more oils through.
!note Noelor the EGS Change stuff is getting a little weird now.
Ftrbzzs it's definitely faster / requires less effort to go through.
You might try and go for a finer grind to adjust that.
ITC people taking coffee very seriously.
MoonWolf story of my life.
The coffee still tastes good.
You'd hope so!
This song is quite great.
It happened again!
Its not the first of this month anymore.
Why did this happen.
Boredom is a strange motivator.
Unsure if this is VB or just... code generally.
But I'm v annoyed at the grammar of If Not vCheckRange Is Nothing Then.
Most languages don't have all those operators as words.
But thats a pretty common pattern.
Does vb not have an isnot ?
Though also Is is specifically an object comparison operator.
For basic variables it's = or.
How is *this* the point at which you say EGSNP is getting weird?
Its getting weird in a different way.
See first i thought the background characters thing was a hah i tricked you all sort of affair.
But at this point its basically beating you over the head with it.
So uhm whats the point ?
Dan wanted to draw people transforming.
Other than the name Burning Rage does seem pretty Priest imo.
V unsure if balanced tho.
Its overcosted if anything.
HotS 2.0 Launch Event stream at the top of the hour if anyone cares.
That thing where i'm going to log in get some free heroes and open some dissapointing loot chests.
HOTS just just do the sensible thing and unlock all heroes for everyone.
Its working just fine for Dota2.
Been a while since I watched dota.
Last major in fact.
In the time since then they apparently changed it enough to move the roshan boss halfway across the fucking map.
There is talents now.
Ah the good old fashioned insider company men interviewing themselves with a questionnaire the interviewee scripted.
Its a real interview!
Doesn't help the immersion of a hanamura tea set gathering when it's literally the exact same studio they run their weekly league broadcasts from XD.
Should have done it in jeff from the overwatch team booth.
Everyone knows you have to wrestle him to use his booth.
It's just better for everyone to not try.
I prefer the broom closet Ben Brode uses for his once an aeon we made a stupidly powerful aggro card w/o realising it we're sorry statements.
Having overly powerful aggro cards means they don't have to worry about an OP thing like Dr Boom again. As no one will reach 7 mana.
And the new cinematic is live.
BwaS i was rooting for diablo.
Genji is gonna get laid flat by any stun potential in HotS.
And with the health pool of a breadstick dibbles shouldn't have too much trouble.
I was hoping for a more replacement cinematic to the Raynor Nova Tyrael v Arthas Dibbles Kerry one though.
Btw MairBear BwaS either of you feel like winning a game i can observe in HS ?
Alright I can take a look.
Got any class/archetype requests no priest/warlock.
Sorry was multitasking.
Need to make a preist deck... is the current meta Purify priest and only Purify? Or is there a viable thing that isn't bullshit like that? P.
MairBear i've never looked into purify priests.
I hate them on principle.
MairBear its okay BwaS had a cool win with murloc paladin.
I mean the aggro shaman fucking laid his own land-mine and then stood 2 feet from it to be fair.
Not sure why he played that ghoul.
I have the board and I'm just going to win more?
Also call in the finishers into evolve combo which is non-zero chance of doomsayer so yknow.
Not the best idea no.
MairBear> there's a sort of dragon priest revival that's less of the tempo curve and more the 'drakonid op and book wyrm are good cards' kind.
Then 'play Lyra play Radiant play a fuck tonne of spells to keep casting spells'.
Hope the spells are useful.
Often involving play New Elise Shadow Visions your own pack gain value get Elise from your pack draw your actual shuffled pack go infinite etc.
Which is great if you're into a really long game i guess.
Purinnerfire priest is bullshit.
Bullshit how ?
The 4/8 for 3.
This looks to much like we really need a card to make purify good.
12 stats for 3 mana.
Turn 3 leaf turn 4 silence divine spirit inner fire.
Or purify divine spirit.
Well that was interesting.
What was ?
Sound cut in nier automata and when I went to the PS menu it screamed like a tormented 8bit ghost.
BwaS let me guess.
We don't get the things from this new HotS thing till tomorrow.
Whereas America already has it?
6 to 8 is maintainance.
Yeh EU patch is Wed.
Afterwards i'm guessing.
Live in US.
Login to US to get... 1 lootbox ?
Whats going on in hots this time.
They're move to a overwatch based lootbox and levels system.
But because hots hates giving people stuff all heroes still have to be bought anyway... because reasons.
Anyway they are giving people who played before boxes based on the levels of their various heros.
And a pack of 20 heroes if you logged in in some timeframe.
Widening the scope of cosmetics unbinding some from level requirements and making paid DLC ones open to ingame currency.
Tldr they want to make more money.
Whats this I hear abouta dva skin?
If you play in the cross promotional event you get a dva skin.
Also 10 lootboxes if you do that 4th step.
I mean overwatch lootboxes.
I know you don't care about hotsboxes.
Is the police dva skin for OW?
Maybe also hots unsure.
Anyone feel like carrying me tomorrow then.
But I have to play hots to get it?
But def OW.
GlennCuttlefish i'll be doing stuff so sure.
Not that i'm good at this game.
Miles ahead of me.
We can be terrible as a team.
I am so bad at anything resembling RTS games.
Well you're miles better than me at OW and I spent a tonne of my adolescence on UT so maybe you'll do okay.
I have never been able to halfway finish a RTS game without cheating like hell.
Yep that was me.
Huh they've changed it up from the last time.
Now you can't clear it all by just playing vs ai.
MoonWolf You can get heroes in the boxes for the little value that is v.
I got a Chromie in one of mine.
A friend of mine got a legendary...
They hate everything now.
I'd love a brightwing commentator.
Sure are good at murder etc.
... But she has a new hat!
The internet was a mistake -Shigeru Miyamoto.
Poltics related.
I was just going to share this and be all get your mind out of the gutter google.
With all of the above*.
But something interesting happened exactly three letters later.
Typing another h returned the list to the original.
That specifically appears when typing wit.
What I actually slept with was my contacts in which showed up after another word.
...or what I was googling in response to sleeping with.
Anyway wtf Google.
What I actually slept with was my contacts in which showed up after another word <- oops.
Going to leave them out a day or two see opticians if I feel sore.
As a free to play player I approve of this new system in HotS.
And now just because I got something like 40 boxes.
MoonWolf TIL thanks to Rage Orc that for each spellpower you have Jade Shuriken throws another shuriken.
They changed it in a recent patch.
Didn't use to be the case.
MoonWolf watching one from several days ago. This double-doomsayer quest rogue makes me laugh.
But why do i have 1100 gems ?
100 are for the mega bonus pack of your choice.
1000 are for ????
I got the pack.
100 are to trick you into buying more ?
I know that you get them every now and then as my game tells me the next 100 milestone awards 150 gems too.
Know what level you got?
Oh ... you get the 1000 gems for reaching level 5 retroactively. However you do not get any of the gems for every 25 levels retroactively.
Apparently it's a thing now o Just here you seem to enjoy this game have some gems.
!note Noelor.
It misses some of the beats in annoying ways.
Someone edit this to make it fit better.
Seems like its already been edited a bit based on the description.
My biggest issue with the P5 soundtrack is that the english is almost worse than P3s.
Nier cosplay is going places.
Ehh.is it cosplay?
Its neat prop never the less.
A small child could fit inside.
Yeah but the arms would have no articulation.
Just add a wheel add a cute pink bow and tell the small child inside to ask any andriods at a convention how babby is formed.
Sadly would work even less since that one was a medium robot.
Damnit you're right.
Goddamnit teen titans design I still cant quite figure out if ravens leotard is meant to be just shiny latex or if it has blue painted on. Leaning towards blue painted on but its difficult tell with the style.
Which teen titans ?
Damned if I know. assuming the animated series from a few years back.
If its the animated one that everyone loves I'd say blue.
Raven isn't that much of a latex person =p.
Yeah but the design sheet I am looking at it could have gone either way with the blue cape reflecting. But I'll go with just painted on since shiny latex is way beyond my skills.
Man another XCOM2 update.
Urgh this week.
Anathema I asked my *Friend about house hunting for you because they're also moving rn.
...that is a Good Gif.
Iits an okay gif.
I rate it 6/10.
GlennCuttlefish you wanted to party up for hots cross promotional quest ?
Huh it allows ai matches.
I might jump on this evening too actually.
If y'all're still going.
Its worth it at least to buy 20 heroes.
Costs you nothing.
Noelor take care of using pointers to friends though.
It's a programming joke.
Its a really specific programming joke that you'd only get if you did programming in languages WITH POINTERS AT ALL.
Which you don't.
VB has byref vs byval passing of variables?
Pointer is address in memory a pointer to something is generally denoted by * in C.
Byref is pointers.
And Friends though I didn't even slightly understand what it means.
I did learn C++ back in uni.
So I basically understand what a pointer is.
I don't understand what a Friend is at all msdn didnt explain it very well.
Ugh I think I passed some seniority level.
Just got spam from a recruiter right.
But it's trying to get a job HERE for some other guy.
Noelor I can't tell if you're doing a Noelor now or genuinely confused.
Doing a noelor.
Anathema I genuinely don't understand what a Friend is in the context of programming.
Other than a type of function maybe?
Noelor you said *Friend * is how you denote something is a pointer.
I had forgotten that part.
Its an important part.
Root of the joke really.
Glenn has been plaing vs ai for 27 minutes now.
I'm struggling to settle on a good way of referring to the person who would be my boyfriend or girlfriend but is also nonbinary.
MoonWolf my team just did not want to push.
Like we had the bottom lane open for 10 of those 20 minutes.
Noelor I thought 'star-friend' was cute I just can't help but make silly jokes.
Don't really blame you.
I do i'm assigning a lot of blame right now.
But are you assigning it with pointers?
NOelor finally finished that game want to join us?
GlennCuttlefish not rn.
I'm at work P.
But this evening if y'all're still going.
I'll probably be up for more games.
I can help if nothing comes up assuming I get it before that.
Now the inevitable 'how do I play this game again after staring at all these new cosmetics'.
BwaS ez dunno. game is pretty hard.
MoonWolf> HGG. Quest Rogue v Murloc Paladin. Rogue is completing their quest with tech choice Hungry Crab.
Is Murlocadin still valid?
Thought it would have gone Wild.
Murloc paladin is still a thing.
They printed more paladin murlocs.
Just gone back to being a 'play everything' aggro deck.
As opposed to running 4 maybe 5 specific murloc cards with anyfin can happen and survive until you draw your entire deck.
Sure Everyfin is gone but murlocs are still good aggro.
And if they've added new murlocadin cards that'll make up for losing...
Whatever that card in TGT was called.
So there's paladin murloc into secret discover then neutral beast to adapt murlocs murloc to buff active murloc and conditional murloc discover murloc.
That seemed pretty clear to me!
I understood that there's a new beast with what I assume is Battlecry Adapt all your murlocs.
!hs Rockpool Hunter.
!hs Primalfin Lookout.
!hs Gentle Megasaur.
Does hearthhead not do tribe any more?
Hydrologist is murloc too though?
Its very cute.
OK and what was that 4th one?
Murloc discover a murloc?
Need to relaunch HS.
Oh thats Primalfin.
Sorry I missed it between the othera.
That's probs a murloc name.
Primalfin is the new... uhm. tribe/clan/group name for murlocs in this expansion.
Whatever you call a group of murlocs.
An ohshit of murlocks.
A oh my god how did I manage to pull all of them or murlocs.
An elwynn forest of murlocs.
A school of murlocs.
A mrgrglgrlgl of murlocs.
Did people want to do that skin thing at some point?
GlennCuttlefish as in HotS?
Tavern brawl run 1 opponent gets a ball of spiders turn 2 I end up casting tree of life when they were half dead.
Still won though.
That new adapt pterrodax card is nuts.
Well that really was a Very Special Episode of XCOM2.
Happy Kings Day.
Which is a real day today.
It's when you're mad but it's making you cleverer somehow.
Okay then.
Valley of Eternity or Ikuisuuden Laakso is a spaghetti-western RPG that takes place in South Pole and the characters are all penguins with magic powers spears and ice skates technology. Well then.
The hello kitty calanders on the fridge just make it MORE finnish.
C_A I have that rulebook.
The penguin one.
I am not surprised.
Pretty sure you have mentioned it before even.
You know none of that description sounds like spaghetti-western tome.
Mostly because it left out a few bits.
All the player characters are kind of outcasts in penguin society.
What with being insane enough to travel outside their packs.
I guess the arctic tundra can be seen as a desert.
The heck does ascii have all that punctuation between Z and a for.
I'm looking at an ASCII table.
I honestly have no clue.
And it has Z at 90 and a at 97.
And... I'm not imagining that regex defaults to ASCII right?
I'm going to guess that its to line up so that moving uppercase/lowercase was an easy subtraction / addition operation.
So A-z would include the half a dozen punctuation chars.
It does not.
Also in regex thats normally expressed A-Za-z.
MoonWolf yeah they're uh.
Or the special character \W is usually used instead of the specified character group.
Noelor that part is intentional.
Yeah when you pointed that out.
That explains it.
Also w is digits too right?
\w is word characters letters.
\W is non-word characters everything else.
The point here is splitting digits and letters we have a list of car registration numbers and thats a fixed format in the UK.
Noelor you change case of ASCII letters by flipping a single bit can't remember what bit.
Anathema this was a lot more relevant then than it is now though.
Your strings shouldn't even be in a ASCII base anyway.
Keyboards are overrated anyway.
I mean if any game is going to be programmed with only a ball.
It should be Kirby.
What about monkeyball though Noelor.
Monkeys with trackballs.
A thousand monkeys with a thousand trackballs eventually programmed this game.
We were aiming for the works of Shakespeare but what you gonna do?
Its a step in the right direction.
Gender is a human social construct that doesn't apply to fictional dinosaurs -Faeriefortune 2017.
Gender is a key part of human culture fictional dinosaurs are an outflow of that culture. Therefor it applies to fictional dinosaurs. Even saying it doesn't apply to a specific set of fictional dinosaurs is itself engaging with gender as part of our culture!
Yoshi are agender.
Are they ?
I am reliably informed that Miyamoto has said so.
We're gonna need more fictional dinosaurs than yoshi to support an agender agenda.
MoonWolf Rayearth time.
Jumping is difficult.
I'm not watching yet so i going to wildly assume this is magic bullshit jumping.
That they need ot learn from a sidequest with some vaguely attractive anime trope.
Nah just regular platforming that whoever had the controller was bad at.
So there's this HotS high level streamer I follow.
Viewer asks re cheese comps eg stitches that have grown more popular lately.
It's ppl playing lower level heroes from their pool they're bad at for loot boxes.
And yep it doesn't work out competitively xD.
All hail the god of loot boxes.
And what do we say to him? I'll take a reroll for 250g plz.
I don't say that becaus ei don't have gold.
Well I'm not really saying it either as it's all new stuff worth accepting.
Also need to hold on to 10k for dva in ~5 wks.
Omg I'm so jealous.
Here we see anathema just a little bit gay for the rock.
MoonWolf aren't we all?
If i have a thing for men its not super muscly ones.
It's specifically the Rock.
Ok and Chris Evans.
Chris Pratt looked supergood in GotG2.
Hopefully seeing that saturday.
MoonWolf> okay yes the tracer brawl is nuts.
Just won it in 6 mins 15 kills to 1 xD.
Well i just lost it twice in a row in not very fun matches.
Well I got 2 wins from it which is pretty good going for my heroes brawl record.
Somehow I have ended up watching a bollywood movie. thanks imgur.
So that was What remains of edith finch.
Technically well done walking sim with amazing environments interesting enough story and somewhat lacking sound design. If you are a babby casual who's into good looking narratives I guess I would recommend it.
Just dont expect gameplay.
Or you know.
A GODDAMN RUN BUTTON.
I mean it's not a running sim.
No but its not a molasses sim either.
If that sounds like your thing and you dont mind a very short experience like 2 hours I think the 20e price tag might be worth it. personally I wouldn't pay that much for it.
Ah well. back to bollywood.
My kid took my skull!
MairBear why dis.
Tell me y MairBear.
MoonWolf y.
I hate you.
We'll never truely know.
!note Noelor This kitchen is too clean for a man he must have a wife - sheesh umi.
Its kind of infuriating leveling these low level characters solo.
When without the party bonus I am always left just short of a level.
MoonWolf I'm also happy that gorillas are trolls.
I didn't think you'd actually get into this game GlennCuttlefish.
Someone give that gorilla a twitter account.
And then give a dolphin a twitter account.
MoonWolf might as well sample it since I have it installed.
And make them talk to eachother over twitter.
The only times I have had a lot of fun is when playing gall tbh. otherwise its a decent timekiller if playing against bots.
MoonWolf Blizzard have spent the last decade+ perfecting the art of giving their games compelling grinds.
But seriously playing gall is fun. Other heroes I feel I am not doing anything.
Sylvanas was a strange playing experience.
Throw knives at stuff then go all yosemite sam on everything.
'syalvanas is deceptive she looks like she'sgoing to be a ranged assassin.
But really she just enjoys shooting buildings.
I recall enjoying Sylvanas.
Patternspider Speak teal to me all night long darling.
Buff Symmetra is great.
While I'm thinking about it.
Noelor i googled buff symmetra apparantly buff symmetra also means genderbended.
!note MairBear I'll be playing this in Leeds if you have the time/funds you should definitely check out the one near you - megagames are real fun.
Anathema MoonWolf - also ^.
I have limited understanding of Netherlands geography sorry.
I thinkt he adjective is Dutch again and not Netherlands. I'm sorry this is such a clusterfuck in english.
Yeah in standard English I think it would be either Dutch geography or better the geography of the Netherlands.
I think I was going for the latter but editing on phone...
Noelor cool will check it out later.
The point was idk where NIJMEGEN actually is relative to you.
Nijmegen is in gelderland its roughtly in the centre of the country i'm in the top.
Better video.
He was inspired by his father an aeronautical engineer and inventor who killed himself when Mr Browning was a teenager. <- okay BBC writer and or editor. this was a terrible terrible way to convey this set of information.
I could understand if you just gave me an error.
But why am I getting different errors in different browsers.
Complex web-apps are hard.
Emma Watson was found out to have money in a hidden overseas tax haven. Sure there are many legitimate reasons for a rich and famous person to do this like anonymity but the idea that Emma Watson is secretly evil and is using it to fund international terrorism or the slave trade in Mauritania or something is too good to pass up.
Good job on your sciencing.
One of these Dota teams at the Kiev Major goes by the name of Thunderbirds.
And I can't help but keep smiling every time they're mentioned.
Anyone feel like joining me in hots while I level these low level characters?
MairBear want to join us? Bwas ?
Sure I'll tab over in a few mins.
Man I need to get one of them dinoz.
You have literally no idea how salty I was when I found out in Ultimax that the Big Bad was Kagatsuchi and not Nyarlathotep DESPITE the fact that the only unaltered clips of the Big Bad's voice in P4A having the SAME EXACT ENGLISH AND JAPANESE VA as reboot!Kashihara!Nyaralthotep. I was GNOSTICALLY SALTY.
This one's a classic.
MoonWolf so afaik bounties no longer care what order you do them in?
They do not.
BwaS GotG2 monday?
MairBear wanna play a round of hots or overwatch in like 10 minutes?
GlennCuttlefish I need to chase my last 7 or so wins in arcade.
Oh boy. need uprising or other arcade maps?
Uprising never loses at least on normal.
So gets them done instead of the gamble of playing with handless humans vs top pro teams in CTF etc.
Oh boy oh boy.
Ive had my share of normal uprising losses.
Often when it's like no mercy no bastion/torb projectile deeps rather than hitscan.
MairBear managed to kick my friend out so ready when ever.
Mair you know how farschnickled I get after a long nights gaming and drinking?
He gets twice as bad.
It was either watching him drop stuff all over my floor all night or mercy boot him out now.
Sitting in menu mostly ready Glenn.
MoonWolf I just watched the clip Fae tweeted from... whenever's anime hell.
How do you feel about inspiring a solid 2 minutes of laughter over cucking?
<- drone eagles will never not be great.
Y'all should read this manga about someone who gets reincarnated as an RPG spider it's p cute.
Glenn and i did a few weeks ago.
Its pretty cute.
And Glenn didn't share it with me? C.
Insert betrayed eyes at Glenn.
We talked about it in channel and everything.
Its not like we did it in secret.
Now if you just cant make the minor effort of obsessively reading everything I say its hardly my fault Mair.
As long as you stop talking when my compy is off or I'm asleep and not in channel.
I mean how can you prove otherwise.
Are you saying I disconnect and then slip back in undercover as someone else? >C.
So I started playing the newer tomb raider game.
I am angered by this one npc describing japanese warriors from a thousand years ago as samurai.
Is it meant to be an ignorant fool of an NPC.
*thousands since samurai have been around since...500ish AD?
Well what could maybe be considered samurai.
Its not like there has been much interaction with the npc's. its mostly been courting tetanus so far.
Noelor she just wants to eat something that isn't disgusting.
I need to get a looper pedal.
Then I can practice improv without another human.
Well thats a thing.
Probably linked it before the resident Sailor Moon expert can probably c/d but regardless eeeyup.
You're pretty good.
Aww thanks friend.
Dota major one doter does that thing where they pull a mob pack out to reset a double spawn only one mob doesn't come with and the effect doesn't trigger.
One caster wait how did that happen?
Partner who knows dota.
The magic of dota.
First one good explanation.
!note GlennCuttlefish.
Well thats a thing.
It seems pretty reasonable to me!
Can confirm this is some pretty gay soaping.
It could be gayer.
Nier stream's on btw.
I shared the soap comic with my *Friend and now they're bombarding me with Lapidot =V.
Lapis/Pearl is the superior Lapis ship.
There you go then.
Well alright then.
Kainé must have half of this desert in her asscrack thanks Joey.
Noelor> what time we meeting tomorrow for film?
Grab food then see what time it is.
My only suggestion for GotG2 is that you stay through the entire credits sequence the payoff is well worth it.
0105 My only suggestion for GotG2 is that you stay through the entire credits sequence the payoff is well worth it.
I don't mind twitch playing ads and maybe I don't quite mind adblock plus getting bribed off by some ad co's...
BUT I AM REALLY TIRED OF THIS ONE FOR THE NEW ALIEN MOVIE.
Switch to ublock instead.
But let's just say I've seen the same Alien Covenant trailer about four times in a row now lately. Every damn time I've been to the movies they've shown the exact same one.
Hey BwaS remember that one about the tiny monster alien from Mars?
That had 2 varieties? One with subtitles needlessly spammed?
FUCK I'd managed to forget that one.
DisguisedToast is a unique gem.
Giving a rank 2 player a win because there's only 6 hours till reset.
!note Noelor.
That is a very large strawberry.
Gotg was alright.
Japanese theme park now offering fake thugs you can beat up to impress your girlfriend D.
That is extremely Japan.
I wonder if the thugs would be beaten up by a lady to impress her boyfriend though...
I've been reading through the Tomb of Dreams this morning.
Japanese theme park now offering fake thugs you can beat up to impress your girlfriend D <- are you okay japan ? do you need help ?
The sample circle Volfer Karal Fire Orchid Iay Selak-Amu who's new to me a western witch twilight Faka Kun Mirror Flag.
Noelor MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish.
MairBear of course.
Noelor i hate this circle.
I also hate that image MairBear.
Can we please stop making loss edits.
Anyway why the hate for Faka Kun?
Its mirror flag hate actually.
She just tells stories to make peoples lives better.
I think they wanted one character without combat for... reasons?
Yeah she has Dodge 3 Thrown 2 neither favoured no other combat stats at all.
Which is why there's actually a sidebar about how to deal with running this game with her as the only PC.
But then you'd be running a game with just mirror flag.
Which is basically just torturing yourself.
And there is more effective ways to do that.
Defining Intimacy Who am I truly? fear.
I need to run or play in Exalted since I have fucken 3 copies of the book now.
Or are you including pdfs.
Pod + deluxe from KS + deluxe with cover the wrong way around.
The middle one being sent to you upon complaining about the latter I guess?
And the PoD because what you were bored?
Don't like reading on screens wanted to read it in the 6+ months between going on PoD sale and getting deluxe.
It's the most impressive take I've seen of that.
From the zoo!
How was that ?
Well it had animals.
!note MairBear Guess what I saw today.
I know my crappy phone camera can do this no justice but they also had this thing.
That is pretty adorable.
Also a camel.
Odd. I cant find that picture of peacocks but it blew my mind.
What was the angriest animal ?
So the peacocks were still in their winter enclosure this year instead of just roaming the island as they usually do.
But get this.
The peacocks were perching.
I had no idea they actually did that for some reason.
This is not news to me.
I am used to seeing them roaming around never did I consider they could even get up there.
Tiger really wanted to be photographed as well.
Oh yeah did I tell you about the case where in Japan they had a cross promotion event with some zoos and Kemono friends?
And a penguin gave up on irl penguins.
Even penguins have superior taste leaving 3dpd behind and got a waifu.
Ehh. I have 5k funbucks in overwatch but I got the genji skin.
Should I buy something else.
What the fuck just happened.
Their team mercy hog torb sym and something defending temple of anubis.
My team is mercy me as zen sym hanzo and widow.
Symmetra's good offense now?
Ehh. maybe situationally.
Pharah lazily killing 3 people is worth more than a mercy rezzing 3 people and keeping the rest alive as far as PotG counts.
Jeff hates supports.
MoonWolf my *Friend started playing Diablo season on PS4 today.
And just got a Puzzle Ring.
That just goes into the cube at 70 right?
Unless console doesn't have that i don't know.
I know virtually nothing about console diablo.
Except that they have nemisis monsters and we don't and its unfair.
That *does* sounds unfair.
They also have more lenient trading between players.
Presumably because less hackable?
AHAHAHAHA AHAHAHA AH NO.
Console diablo is rife with hacking duping and exploits.
All I know is that it's more lenient.
The other comment was idle conjecture.
Console diablo need to be able to play offline and so character data is stored on your console.
Woo i got my three hearthstone packs for voting on the one canadian team in the collegiate tournament.
Nah that's not what it's for.
Its not ?
It's a general giveaway of 3 for everyone based on a playerbase numbers milestone.
Where are my canada packs.
Have you seen Dumbo? I haven't You probably shouldn't it's super racist fair.
No idea man but I bet they're sitting somewhere near mine in a vault somewhere.
Incidentally i have a 80 gold for playing with a friend quest.
And a watch someone for a pack quest.
I have that spectate quest too funnily enough.
Sure is fun with HotS reduced map pool getting back to back games on same map that the hero you're playing is bad on.
Yeh CA me and moon were just talking about it 2h ago p.
I'm having the same problem with AoT that I did with KLK when Romi Park speaks I wonder why her character has the voice of a teenage boy.
MairBear wanna do last minute loot box farming in arcade after I get my coffee?
The event should be over.
To free me from this torture.
Free you from the robot murder torture.
Also what mairbear said.
Even as events begin later here they apparently end a bit later as well.
Should it be over.
May 1st it said.
So HotS is a lot better than when I last played it back in beta.
Anathema yeah it has developed.
New and exciting methods of exercise.
That is some pretty deep water.
Fury is not a horseman fuck you darksiders. don't go making up new ones just because you don't like Famine.
He's loving this shit.
Not what I expected.
MoonWolf PatternSpider has a github page for suggestions right?
Or would you rather I just yell at it here?
Noelor both are fine.
I don't check my github daily though.
Well here is easier for me so ...
Noelor sure i guess.
100% because of Dob.
I'll get to that later today or tomorrow.
When i feel like actually waiting 10 minutes for visual studio to start.
Seriously i can start most games faster than i can start visual studio.
Anathema MoonWolf did you look any more at Urban Nightmare last week BTW?
I really can't affford to travel atm.
Which sounds lame i know but.
Unemployement is great.
Nah that's fair.
Diving back on OW as they extended event another day.
Legendary in a loot box and it's vanilla pharah skin p.
Rip pity timer.
Noelor I forgot.
Anathema you should check it out it's basically a day-long RP experience without all the running around waving swords of LARP.
And if you get cast properly it gets p political.
Also I think it'd be real cool to get in touch afterwards and chat about how things go down in two locations.
Maybe but I also might literally throw up with anxiety.
Thats just early onset zombification.
Anathema I mean if you can I recommend finding someone to go with.
Like Geoff sp or your gf.
So there's someone you know.
And they'll probably let you name drop those people when you sign up and put you on the same team.
Tickets are bought for a specific team for cambridge.
They do things differently to the folks organizing things up north then =\.
I got Geoff on board got him a zombiemeister ticket.
Got a federal advisor and city operations too.
Got a link to their site? Sounds v different in fact.
Sweet I might get 16gb more RAM in my work desktop going up to 28gb.
Hopefully I didn't mishear 20GB would be less great.
RAM has gotten much cheaper in the almost 3 years I've had this machine.
Put VS on a ramdisk.
For ultimate speed.
Eh I've got an SSD already.
Things only get slow because I ran out of RAM running SQL Server Oracle Redis 2+ web browsers etc |.
Fucken electron apps.
Noelor do you know what role you will have?
So up north in Leeds/Birmingham we've signed up to a waiting list.
And advised of our experience and interests.
And nearer the time the control there will take all the sign ups and sort them into teams and just send them out.
Relatedly I would recommend just getting two tickets for one team so you and Geoff can actually work together.
And if there's a city with space I'd recommend that level.
There wasn't any city with 2 spaces anyway.
Only mutliples left were zombiemeister governer advisors and federal operations.
Then I'd say governor > feds.
Idk what zombies'll be like that wasn't a player role last year.
But the politics mirrors that of the USA so city teams report to governor teams report to feds.
I liked the sound of federal operations.
Feds are going to have to be coordinated across the however many sites.
Would be my only concern.
5 city hall teams.
Ok so the deal with this game is each of the RL cities represents an I na game state.
So the federal teams will be liaising across the however-many RL cities to represent coordinating the however many in-game states.
I assume via VoIP or some such?
It mentions email.
That seems slow.
Are you saying you don't think I should do federal operations? p.
I have no opinion on the matter.
I wanted you to be clear on what that involves.
Sounds like yes so ... Go for it?
Still going to heavily recommend getting Geoff on the same team though.
Having someone nearby you can check in with who's actually supposed to be on your side.
And who you know.
V v helpful esp. as a first-timer.
Anyway off to run Panic~.
Running off in a panic? P.
Well it took almost a year but as a pharah main have now gotten the Cute spray achi.
Anyone for relaxing hots AI matches for POLICE D.VA unlocks.
I thought you had to play against humans for that.
Oh yeah part 2 you do.
Also dinner in a bit maybe after that.
Don't think officer dva is live yet.
Quest 2 Opens Week of May 1 Blizzard should fucken fix their website then.
Probably live in US with patch being last tuesday but EU was wednesday so I guess it'll hit tomorrow.
Mvp as abathur woo.
Oh fuck off nyaatorrents got taken down?
All the anime is gone now.
Maybe not gone but definitely a pain in the ass to find in some cases.
Look I dont want to go back to the bad old days when I had to lurk IRC to get my fix.
Yeah all their hosting got deleted or something.
Welp Nyaa is apparently perma dead.
Rip all the anime.
A long way in breast implant technologyh.
As a supporti can confirm genji needs healing.
Basically all the time.
What a time to be alive!
A time of unmatched fanservice.
EGS never being straight ever again.
Gods bless that man.
Why is Genjis sword a penis.
All swords are essentially penisis.
What with vagina or perhaps a synonym or in another language translating as sheath.
So that was tomb raider. Music did its job but was nothing special sound design was good plot was kinda bland but I wasn't expecting anything special anyway.
But how was the visceral death animations.
Gameplay wise the jumping parts were mostly good enough. controls mostly worked. Late game it relied too much on sitting behind chest height walls in combat.
Once every single goddamn enemy suddenly became omniscient and had magical rifles with pinpoint accuracy.
Ehh. Didnt see too many visceral death animations but the QTE timings were weird in my opinion.
Like there was a good 1-1.5s seconds you had to wait before pushing the buttons once the prompt started appearing.
Oh and the most anticlimatic last boss I have seen in a while.
The actual last opponent being a purely QTE thing and the boss before that felt more like a midboss or a slightly tougher basic enemy.
I just glanced at the credits scrolling by and apparently squeenix japan has a team called EXTREME EDGE I assume it always has and will be in all caps.
Yeah they publish the Mature games.
!note Noelor an organiser also suggested I put all my tickets in one team so I have now we will all be Governer's Staff members.
Would be better without iron fist.
... fucking Ripley?
I'll watch anything that lets me see Krysten Ritter kick punch people around.
Was there a game tonight anathema ?
Scheduled yes maybe running I have had a mild headache for 3 days.
Ok. I'll try being back in 1.5ish hours then.
Anathema aiming for half past?
GlennCuttlefish behold the nier DLC in action.
Jesus christ how horrifying.
Number plucked out of thin air.
Nah that'd be a 2.
Thats a 2 model face.
See this is why I explained.
Play nier so you understand its deep lore Noelor!
Also so you can apreciate that 6O is the gayest andriod.
Six zero or six oh?
<- not really spoilers.
...wait is nyaa actually down?
Its not just down its gone.
Anyone for a game of vs ai hots.
I prefer some games of not vs ai hots.
But i'll playh.
Well we can try that just dont expect a victory.
I'm going to the shops but will probs join the storm when I get back?
Switching over if heroes is going.
Had an absolute nightmare on OW this session.
Pretty much all had at least 1 cancerous excuse for humanity.
And then 2 had one of blue team who having precious Won The Video Game is now actively seeking to Lose The Video Game.
Can pull a sword out of her chest <- also turns into a car.
GlennCuttlefish i know what you were thinking and blizzard was thinking it too. what overwatch needed was a genji and hanzo buff.
So they did that!
Got full patch notes for the PTR MoonWolf.
Ah good old accidental infinite loop.
It's been a while.
Programming is fun.
I've actually started writing classes now though!
Including collection classes because by default VBA's collections are totally untyped.
Well its VBA nothing about that language suprises me.
Noelor untyped how? as in you can add 1 and 2 to a collection together?
I knew I should've enrolled for that fantasy writing class.
More to the point I can set up my new class CEmployee dim in a Collection of CEmployee objects then add a string to the collection.
Noelor seen plugin should now be lowercase.
Sorry i mean.
Case insensitive because it lowercases everything.
Sorry but i did not convert old data.
Anathema so this is why I've got CEmployee which is the object class and CEmployees which is the collection class for a collection of that object type.
Those Cs should be lowercase incidentally but autocorrect.
These are macros for excel?
Anathema don't. just. don't.
Noelor doesn't need your functional programming bullshit.
I mean also.
AFAIK I don't have a F# compiler.
Whereas VBA is built into Excel.
Pfff it's free.
That does not grant me admin rights P.
I mean obviously I'm also not *seriously* suggesting you use F# for Excel automation.
Hell yes.
Oh god he has the warhammer equivalent of Blink.
Will need to make myself a Marbo.
Granted he'll only be around for like a month.
More or less.
He does have rules for Shadow War as well though.
I need to get the Shadow War book on saturday.
Ingenieurgesellschaft fur verehrsplanung und verkehrssicherung.
Here's his SWA rules.
German is such an elegant tongue.
Noelor its great!
Traffic-planning and traffic-something i don't know.
Engineer for planning and traffic safety according to gtranslate.
Even it does suggest it should be verkehrsplanung to be more correct for traffic planning.
Not a single engineer a brotherhood of engineers.
I'm willing to accept that whoever entered this made a typo.
MoonWolf publicly trading company of engineers iirc but yes.
Gessellschaft is a really interesting word actually well the dutch equivalent is and i'm assuming the german is the same.
I just parse it as equivalent of Ltd or Plc.
I modern day yes.
The history is really good though.
So back to the 1700's. Back to Guilds Gildes.
When you as a young lad were going to learn a Trade that had a proper associated guild you would start as a Leerling then if you were deemed proficient enough you would become a Gezel or in German a Gessel.
A brotherhood of engineers sounds badass.
A Gesel would pair with a Master to learn the fine details of the trade and ideally promote to a Master.
Equivalent to apprenticeship then?
Not all of them do some of them did. Either they were ismply not good enough did not wish to enter into the political games did not have the money to become independant Masters do not work in the shops of other masters or did not have an appropriate social position.
For instance Masters were supposed to be married.
Even today in dutch an unmarried man is called a Vrijgezel. Vrij as in free un attached.
Noelor more like a junior-position.
There is still teaching involved but its more about helping you get to the proper level of experience advanced stuff etc.
A student/leerling is largely a timesink for the master a gezel does real work.
Related thing to that some people did not advance to the position of master because once again. masters operated their own workshops.
So you had the unnoficial ideal of a meester-knecht.
Competent enough to be a master in his own right but technically just an assistant.
Looks cogent with knight?
I believe it is.
Knecht is originally more like servant i believe.
Well afair knights were sworn to lords but were still y'know knights with all the power and expertise that implies.
So it makes sense.
They just weren't landed I *think*.
See also the german mercenary corpses known as Landsknecht.
I was actually talking about Battle Brothers all along.
If anyone is interested in weird South Korean post-rock I recommend JAMBINAI.
Not really my thing.
The fuck is this ?
The BBC did a programme on Bertrand + other non-food things.
It does include a personal trainer who rests and cleanses her digestive system with juices though |.
It gets rid of the toxics anathema.
This person adds activated bamboo charcoal to the smoothies he sells.
>not activating your almonds.
>Not activating all of your ingredients for the most woke smoothie.
Sadly woothies doesnt have such a great ring to it.
But knowing all the dumb shit that's being sold I am sure a woke smoothie would sell. Add a mention or two about filters or something too.
Activated almonds” are almonds that have been soaked in water for 12 hours.
I'm really hopign that doesn't actually Do anything because i don't want water soggy almonds.
That sounds terrible.
Never expected to hear that phrase outside 4chan.
Barely heared it there for that part.
Guess its a /fit/ thing more.
Important things Yoko Taro has revealed in an interview Nier Automata andriods don't have genitals duh but they can install some.
So you know good to know. thanks taro.
Why couldn't they.
They can install other parts.
Its not wh couldn't they its why did he feel a need to specify.
Remove genital parts Impervious to crotch kicks.
Because its important to know.
Because remember don't fist android girls.
Removal of genitals was the first safety measure introduced.
It wasn't actually they just didn't install any.
Because uhm why would you.
Pretty su...Goddamnit I cant even comment on this because its spoiler territory.
Its all spoilers.
Its all fucking spoilers.
Spoilers all the way down and then up again.
A star wars day askreddit megathread for people to ask questions pertaining to the saga.
Jesus christ people stop you'll doom us all.
Good thing it doesnt have the sharp edge forward.
The words of someone who's forgotten how beetles fight.
With large knives.
The tutorial mission in Dishonored 2 is real cute.
Its a tradition.
Corvo just wants his daughter to be safe and safe means able to beat him up =3.
Oh hey neat new tits game is out.
New tits ?
Senran Kagura I believe.
Trails in the sky.
Completely different tits.
As much as I value the idea of senran kagura they sadly are not very good games.
MoonWolf you remember the Outsider shows up and brands Corvo to give him powers?
In 2 you can say No thanks Mr Outsider I don't want any powers.
You know just as an extra challenge mode.
Thats not a gameover ?
No you just get to play the game without powers now.
My dad told me about you and powers seem like a bad deal to me.
I imagine that also otoh Nah I'm good this time did not enjoy your last 'gift'.
Also you shoved my moms heart into a creepy artifact not a fan of that either.
Because of course I *am* playing as Emily but you can play as Corvo if you want.
Oh the heart's back!
And is explicitly Jessamine's now as opposed to that being subtext.
Here you go emil its your mothers heart preseved in a creepy magic artifact it tells you SEEECRETS.
It was a very pronounced subtext.
Much like corvo's dad-ness.
Holy shit i watched a video on the dishonered 1 heart to remember some of the stuff it tells you and i just realized somethingi should have figured out at the time i played the game.
Granny Rags is the Empresses Mother.
Thats it thats the whole thing.
I mean unless the heart says Hi mum when Granny shows up...
I was wondering what led you to that.
Not that I don't believe it sounds about right for that game.
Okay so the video makes it more explicit.
At one point the heart talks about her parents and the colour of their hair and describes her mother as having ashen hair. then jumpcuts to Granny Rags who has ash grey hair.
And then granny rags tells you a story about the empress and her getting killed in which she refers to the empress as child.
Yeah still a good game.
Also if bone charms are still random I got a pretty good first one I think.
Gotta love OW competitive can't even finish the load screen before the 222 spam hits.
Or the fact a player leaves and the match cancels.
And then you go and win a round by virtue of 1 on red being a griefer seeking bottom skill rating by losing on purpose.
And to top it off blue had 2 of those kinds as well only they decided they'd let the red one tank first.
The fuck is going on in OW ranked.
Oh yeh all 3 got reports alright.
Oh I dunno fucked up meta at my bronze MMR I guess.
I mean they even patched it out if you get beneath 500 you can't see a number anymore but god knows what actually gets done from reports.
No clue i assume they have a fairly strict filter on the things since its so easy to report shit.
Some popular ex-esports HotS streamer did similar smurfed an acc tanked it on purpose to bronze 5 so he could climb it up to masters to prove a point.
I have no doubt it gets flooded with bullshit.
What point even was that yes i can get to masters ?
We know you got there already.
Nobody doubts you.
The arguments that some players deserve higher and that they're in elo hell.
Have the skill but can't climb from the ppl around them.
So yeh he fucked up the games on both the way down and way up just to get twitch views.
Should have just bought the new account.
Instead of being the exact person people blame for not being able to get out of gold or something.
And this was a guy who started a competitive team and qualified for HGC this season until he backed out to keep on streaming.
Amazing reference to a band called Animals as Leaders.
Ah the good old red team we don't want to actually play the game comp.
Widow basty torb simon yeah you can all fuck right off.
Well its time to really improvise my dinner.
Planned on making some kind of chicken-shiitake stir fry deal...Out of soy sauce.
Thats fine I'll just make a curry...Out of coconut milk.
Valid curry ingredient.
Its the best curry ingredient and I am not going to make curry without it.
I guess I could make some kind of a salad?
And then you're out of dressing.
Thats fine hads enough mayo and vinegar to improvise that part.
Certainly is j-rpg. Figure I'll do this one room and go to bed. 15 minutes later I finish that fight.
40 minutes after that I finish the cutscene.
!note Noelor Goodest Dog.
MairBear that is a good dog.
She's your buddy now but wait until buddy gets hungry then you get to be a snack!
MoonWolf don't kinkshame.
MairBear I am not sure I like this new turn bonus in trails in the sky 3.
100% death effect.
Just imagine that landing on enemy aoe turn.
I disagree on the hatpoint.
Its all about biggest brims and pointiest tips.
You know what I got? Scathe.
Healers why didn't you adjust???
As someone who hasn't healed that raid I still know it's their job to adjust to the blm we're all supporting.
Just go stand somewhere that isn't leylines.
Either you adjust or you lose your DPS.
However you wanna roll.
Especially to the one shot mechanics though.
's fine i can just use those cooldowns i'm not healing in to do dps.
Hell if it's a 1 shot the tanks need to LB and adjust too.
Besides leylines doens't have a 10 minute cooldown.
Just put down some more.
Ok you dont clearly understand how black mages do.
It has a longer cooldown than duration though C.
Time works different when you are playing a black mage that minute of leyline CD you are missing will feel like 10.
And it is since you are in superior damagetime now.
I am still upset about the flare nerfs.
Every goddamn time I play a mumorpeger. I pick a class see fun numbers and then WHAMMO NERF HAMMER.
You're going to be upset about flare nerfs for the rest of your life.
Indeed I will.
Fucking summoners got the best aoe? what is this bullshit.
Just play a summoner then.
You get the best limit break animation too.
I dont see a meteor in their animation.
Also play a summoner? Rely on others for ultimate power? not my thing.
Dragoon limit break is good too.
Still no Teraflare though.
Even when it's a jalapeno pepper or a chicken glenn?
Not even then. the only thing I can rely on is my leylines.
I still hate how all the default melee dps ones are just pretending to be cloud for a bit though.
Could at leas thave let you swing around your own weapon.
Instead of a buster sword.
I know Person we don't like is a guest here but we don't excatly have the happiest history do we? So my question to you is do I offer him tea? - Tataru being Tataru.
MairBear you offer them tea but in a mean way.
With no saucer...?
You give them a spoon but no sugar or milk!
Welp my favourite wowheadlike for FFXIV updated the site.
Apparently they wanted to look like garbage.
Decisions decisions. Should I drop this otherwise useless character that has one good skill that can pretty much carry me through most fights even if its boring or just pick up a character that does actual damage.
Wait that didnt quite make sense but you know what I mean.
...Why is this even a thing.
This game has a random party button.
Well in case you can't decide what your party should be!
Perfect circle with a small entry way.
I wonder if that will be a boss room.
Hmm hmm hmmm.
I wonder if that will be a boss room <- on day i'll make a raid and it be nothing but boss rooms and the bossfights will be in the corridors.
MoonWolf make one of the middle ones tactic be drag it out of the corridor to a boss room.
Telling me all this would have been avoided if I didn't do that bloody obviously bad move 3 patches ago does NOT make up for it.
Having a character tell me*.
Is it that lancer asshole its that lancer asshole isn't it.
I'm not gonna name names of anything until at least glenn has caught up eventually.
I'm going to continue with the understand its the lancer.
If it works for the raids it works for the plot.
Blame the DRG.
Surprised Alphinaud hasn't respecced to one yet.
He has all the right qualities.
He's too busy having carbuncle skins nobody else gets to have.
His real power is access to a seperate alphinaud only microtransaction store.
Pun about alpha testing and his name.
Hard to make it work without the ability to emphasise and inflect.
His sister power is the ability to be competent.
Its pretty unique when it comes to npcs.
Players too come ot think about it.
My body And quest log is ready for Stormblood now.
40 days should be enough to finish p5 and Nier.
How are you not done with p5 yet.
I slacked off the last week and a bit.
Look just summon a giant penis stuck to a wagon and kill things.
I mean it's an SMT game right? So playing it at the correct difficulty sometimes means losing an hour of progress. It cannot be helped.
You could get gud.
MoonWolf the odds are in my favour.
You my friend are still terrrible at math.
Would anyone care to log into HotS to help me get my Cop.Va skin?
Need 2 more co-op games.
Certainly i did promise.
Noelor garnets new name!
Its totally different.
MoonWolf well done.
Its french now.
Nobody will figure it out.
Iirc I headcanoned it as having been french before.
Welp thanks montreal.
Your collegiate hearthstone team winning me 3 packs won me... 115 dust!
The life of a mercy main.
Come in at a minute remaining with my team failing to capture the first point.
3 minutes later we win.
Not a single thanks.
Sometimes when there's red team still to shoot holding down C and drifting top left is a little too much apm.
This week's Titan continues the storm of everyone is either dead or titan and even some of the dead were probably titan.
With marvellous retcon plot holes and terrible attempts made at filling them in.
Shout out to character who during cast recollection to events of S1 drops the I can't remember.
Apt given it was 4 fucking years ago xD.
Your collegiate hearthstone team winning me 3 packs won me... 115 dust! <- i got better than that.
Think i had like 300.
Thats pretty good.
Wonder if they performed E version of Weight of the world.
That'd be hard to do.
Perhaps. But would be worth it I think.
That is real cute yes.
So I have been careful reading about this game since I want to avoid spoilers yet want to be sure I am not missing anything since the game is notorious for that.
So here I was wondering just how exactly the benched party member bonuses worked and the game in game guide spoils the whole party lineup for me.
It was mostly what I expected but one thing definitely should not be there.
Is it some previous big bad or something ?
Something along those lines.
Argh goddamnit the game wants me to split up into 2 parties.
Now I will have to spend the next 30 minutes trying to figure out how to split the party and then another 30 minutes setting up the spells.
It lets you PICK?
MoonWolf is already sold.
Currently engaged in older and possibly better jrpg ffix and it does not let you pick your split up party.
In fact most don't.
Its a good thing to do.
FF9 does eventually.
But for the first disc or two the split is entirely plot-based.
Last time i played this game i only got past beatrix.
So beyond that i don't know.
Past as in i beat her without - oh no don't tell GlennCuttlefish - stealing her item and saving after the cutscene.
GlennCuttlefish its a rare steal before you can get the steal boosting skill its like 1/256.
MoonWolf I was playing Dishonored 2 and found a basement.
There's nothing in the basement - no maps lore money or magic.
But there are a couple of corpses dumped there.
That truely is the creepiest basement in all of dishonored.
Not the creepiest anymore.
Presumably as a joke for if you end up there with a corpse of your own.
Its the communal assassination corpe storage basement.
Also turns out the steam FFIX has a checkpoint system.
It checkpoints to the last screen transition.
Sadly doesn't skip pre-boss dialogue.
But better than savegames.
There hopefully that party lineup is optimal. now for the spell setup.
You are already 30 minutes into this endeavour.
She devils sea devils by the sea shore.
Really pissed off at the levels of greed I'm seeing from some decks right now.
C'thun priest with elise free from amber So Goth MC.
Kazakus priest with yogg and n'zoth.
Like how do these people get their wins if they do nothing before turn 8.
I mean fuck that reno priest if they pulled a twisting nether off a kabal courier had death in opening hand and poly'd a c'thun from kazakus.
No sympathies from me that yogg lava bursted your own face off.
!note MairBear persona 3 let's use our sport equipment Persona 4 let's smuggle replica swords under our shirts Persona 5 i brought a gun.
<- LOOK ITS AN AMERICAN.
No no I think its fine there.
But... but... it's a proportion based two way run off.
And your candidate ran on a populist line.
Shit like that sub is why I can never fucking go on r-all again...
BwaS do you have plans for next week?
Because my *friend is hosting in Fenham and I'm allowed a +1.
I'm talking about Eurovision if that wasn't already your assumption.
Well I was about to say well it's esc week so tues/thurs/sat are out.
So this on the sat?
Yeah I'd probs be game.
Well tbh him and one of the other Chrises both got involved in dire spacefaring sci-fi flick.
Members of the possibly unfavoured team in a Heroes matchup bet their hair on a win.
They've now lost it 3-1. and one of them had an afro.
Well the shrimp mushroom curry turned out edible but only barely.
I think I used too much curry paste since its been ages since I last used any.
MoonWolf ->.
MairBear good cards.
I'll take 2 of each.
Mfw every time I try to play Sylvannas in HotS I get put on Hanamura.
Terrible 4chan taste.
That is true yes.
Mairbear I cant get used to this.
There is no zane in this game.
He has been replaced by his identical brother Zin instead.
Why would you change the name 3 games in.
MairBear are you interested in 80 childrens cardgame coins ?
Blizz seems to think I really want to play 50 class cards.
Do you though ?
Yess the DB book definitely wont include White Veil Style.
Good why would they even include a style that doesn't exist from a society that definitly not real.
Bum I've run out of code to review but I am not cognizant enough to write compelx f# today.
Time to fake till you make it? P.
Just pretend you wrote it untill it magically appears.
<- hey look this trailer is chaossmurf bait.
Even that LoL imagine dragons trailor music he loves.
Life of a mercy main 45% team damage healed and not a single commendation.
GlennCuttlefish I know right.
That's why I love Mercy's 'sometimes I wonder why I even bother' voiceline.
In fact best reward in that event.
I also liked Zenyatta's 'If you do not change direction you may end up where you are headed.'.
Symmetra had a good one too. I forget it off.
Off the top of my head*.
Yes zenyatta i apreciate your understanding of linear time and momentum.
Zenyatta fancies Laozi.
I haven't looked at the list of variable types in a while.
Only just noticed that VBA has not only int and long but also longlong.
For 64-bit systems.
Programmers - still bad at naming things.
Ugh i hate that name.
Long is dragon in chinese no? Just think of it as double dragon!
IDK if anyone here still keeps up with AoT but what even lately.
Did it finally devolve into titan fight club ?
I'd not say anything one way or the other.
I'm waiting for the dub >_>.
MairBear BwaS is I think.
Not a problem though because in the new Warhammer 40000 models in a squad can fire at different targets. Noice.
8th ed baby it looks to be ballin'.
Time to paint all my Heavy Weapon Teams I guess.
Oh you're going to need em.
Some quick maths tells us that we’d need over 500 bolters firing at that Gorkanaut to bring it down whereas you’d need just over a dozen lascannons.
That seems... wrong.
No they've redone the statlines.
I hope FRF2RF is back.
Vehicles have wounds now.
Only thing I'm sad about is it seems vehicle facing has no meaning now.
They don't have different target scores per facing ?
Not from what has been revealed so far.
Thats a loot of wounds.
The Knight has 20.
Its warhammer expensive.
Its a seperate category of expensive.
Depends really on how crazy you go in the shop.
Or what you order from the dwarf bar.
So Nier Autobots was cracked over the weekend. Now an important thing to know about playing NierA on PC is that you are basically going to Have to use a mod called FAR to make it not perform like shit.
And FAR updated so it doens't work if its not a legit copy.
Inb4 they have to pirate FAR too.
What does FAR do to make it work? why does it perform so badly without that?
Messes with shaders.
And internal resolution scaling stuff.
Basically its a bad port.
I keep forgetting that NP++ has a save all button.
Until I've saved all bar one of my files.
Can !Note ^that^ to me please?
!note Noelor.
GlennCuttlefish i didn't think this was possible but apparantly some people do the final final bit of nier automata without the actual special bit.
Which is... impressive.
I knew it was possible just yeah nearly impossible.
Not sure I will finish this since its been sitting on my desk for a week now but archiving it anyway lines once again not mine. also a lot of the detail is missing.
Why is lumiere a skull ?
Dunno. just something I picked up from 4chan in a morning coma.
I think it was the first clean lineart picture in that thread.
Fuck me play one game on ladder never notice one red player show up all round.
As a result win it 3-0.
Go off for a bit and resume then get that player on blue on volskaya which we don't end up winning.
Blizz idea of 50% matchmaking alternate some MMR saboteur evenly between red and blue teams.
Sure is fun having all opportunities to climb taken out of your hands.
Argh I give up for now with this stupid sidequest.
I need to find the a NPC. Well I have found the NPC I just have no way of getting to them.
Theres a rope behind the building he is on top of but I cant use that there are no stairs up as far as I know.
The game has a total lack of ladders in this area.
Sure is fun being on Mercy and the times where a res is good you're dead.
Such is the life of a mercy.
I got 27 elims as a tank Roadhog on 2CP.
Sscore screen pops up.
28 on a dva.
I lie koth not 2cp.
I wish the only way to get fire gauge as mercy wasn't rezzing.
Playing exalted I just won a simhata.
I am a 2.2m robot person with Str 7 and a magical jetpack.
Noelor looks good ot me.
Oh yeah weekly rotation is switching soon. Time to farm all level 2 supports to level 3.
Not sure how to feel about winning on lijiang 3-0 cos midway through second round it became a 6v4.
Got to the point of switching off solo support lucio to get some pharah deathmatching in.
Cancels out that nepal game where red reverse swept pulling it out of their arse.
When it felt like we had some of them hard countered first two rounds.
Lol try Half Payne mod and I get stuck on the fucking train ride because one of the doors glitched out v.
Also oh my fucking god I have forgotten how slooooow the goddamn opening trainride is.
Its the worst.
It took me three attempts to pass that entire segment got stuck twice.
Why not just enable noclip after the first one?
Didnt want to work.
!note MairBear.
Its a bread cat ?
Because why not?
Dva on the hots ptr and she is weird.
What did they change ?
Self-destruct is a basic.
Can't change facing in defence matrix.
One heroic is her bunny hop emote the other is a line attack fired when outside mech.
That does sound weird.
Also designated DLC skin went to a SC1 Terran Goliath design.
One base tint is Asuka and Unit 02.
Another is possibly GitS named 'Major' and she has purple hair.
I dunno half expected the Police one given the Genji one was Oni on his incorporation.
Yes that is GitS.
231805 one base tint is Asuka and Unit 02 <- but we still can't have asuka in overwatch.
MoonWolf dyk if there's any way to stop the cursor locking onto text whenever I click in firefox?
It's real annoying.
I'm not quite sure what you mean by this.
If I click anywhere in a webpage element that contains text I get a flashing text entry cursor somewhere in that text field.
And my arrow home and end buttons now move that cursor instead of scrolling.
Wait just random blocks of text not input fields ?
I don't even know how to make that happen.
Okay this is just me googelign stuff.
I was about to go there myself yeah.
Try pressing f7.
Wts is that *supposed* to be doing?
Help people select text withkeyboards.
I am frankly astonished that Grant Howitt's only won one of these contests.
The others are also really good.
Holy shit I just read Memories and am now crying a little O_O.
/ignore. Love D.Va.
Don't forget the olive!
Once again you forgot a minor detail weatherbot.
LIKE ALL THAT SNOW.
In may ?
Yeah. its not much and it should be gone by the end of the day.
But even so welcome to FInland.
Snow during the midsummer is not unheard of in parts of Finland. Fortunately for me its quite rare in the southern parts.
Well then.
GlennCuttlefish yaaay snöö!
Nvm wrong link in that case p.
No. Boo. Boo snow. Boo.
I just looked at last year's temperature and it was +22.
And now it's +3.
So you never know what you get!
Except for snow.
You always get snow.
Sometimes you get sleet.
Sometimes you get all the forms of water in one shower.
Liquid solid different form of solid not quite solid but cold enough to be solid gas plasma ?
I hear some undertones of sarcasm there but you underestimate our summers.
MoonWolf along those lines yes.
Looking forward to my summer holiday in Finland EVEN MORE now.
Anathema all the snööööö.
Anathema July has a bit less snow than other months don't worry.
Oh you're going to visit finland again?
Neat. Let me know if you feel like meeting up again while here.
I'm sure that can be arranged!
Welp good thing I got home early. Suddenly started hailing.
Anathema GlennCuttlefish beer will happen.
He's doing an amazing job.
I linked that one earlier today v.
Whoaaaahh ledge-end-air-ay!... oh duplicate towelhead genji...
Anathema You have 7 to choose from but the one I want to discuss is ‘First Rank Fire! Second Rank Fire!’. This now makes a unit of Astra Militarum infantry treat their lasguns and hot-shot lasguns as Rapid Fire 2 that’s 4 shots per Guardsman at half range!
Because the guard didn't have enough shooting going on yet ?
Not really in 7th squads could take a heavy weapon but the things you want to shoot with a heavy weapon and the things you want to shoot with lasguns rarely intersect.
And orders were cool but relied on being in range AND a dice roll.
For a minor benefit to one of the worst infrantry in the game p.
My Exalted South West headcanon.
Giant lizard cowboys ?
Characters can’t join units anymore that is /massive/.
Hope the 'characters can't be shot unless they are the nearest model' rule also applies to command squads for guard platoons though.
Sounds like sniper weapons ignore that rule too that's nice.
Also no challenges.
Challenge rules are gone from the fight phase but the restriction on hitting lone characters is only in the shooting phase so expect to still see mighty heroes taking chunks out of each other in the fight phase.
!note Noelor ?
Aaaa I dont like this sidestory.
Its put me in the worst area of the game.
As a solo party.
With a NPC escort who is not allowed to die.
The best kind.
Well I think I've seen better first semi finals for Eurovis.
Some serious 80's rave retro shit going down.
Video games.
Allison i don't know what you are doing but it seems to involve sponatiously summoning vaguely bhuddist divine images so its probably going to be awesome.
Finally in the last act of Persona 5 judging by what friends have said.
MoonWolf the donger in a cart has appeared as a non-boss enemy. It's name? Cos P5 doesn't reveal the actual name the personas until you acquire one yourself Throbbing King of Desire D8.
This is why this game has an M rating.
Because of the penisdemons?
The throbbign kings of desire yes.
It's great because you can rotate the model when inspecting it.
And see it has in fact got a pair of balls at the back too.
Animated cutscene during which the protagonist silently protagonises. \o/.
Protagonising in a persona game. so uhm. sitting around while other people unload their life issues on you for minor gains in personal power ?
And you nod and gesture.
With the occasional hmm sound.
Untill eventually agree to Die For You.
Well that was a round.
Healed 67% team damage taken.
And not once during that round was I on fire not even after rezzing 2 people on the side.
But hey at least I got 2 commendations from my team so thats nice.
Take those to the bank.
Buy some portraits with them.
I dont understand it.
Its freaking huge.
You can see it on the map.
How can nobody stand on the payload.
I really prefer standing behind the payload if at all possible.
You are a babby casual but I appreciate you being withing 5 miles of the damned thing.
Real men stand on the payload cursing about snipers.
Corpses don't move payloads GlennCuttlefish.
You know what else doesn't move payloads?
Bahaha amazing flame war going down in one of the HotS channels today.
Some person upset they can't climb hero league stuck at silver 5 elo hell etc.
Profile Zeratul is their only hero above L10 they chain pick zera occasionally other assassins or a rare muradin.
They're not winning many games xD.
Maybe they should try a little harder.
Just press join game over and over with your favourite hero isn't trying.
Why would anyone choose Zeratul when you can be Alarak.
MairBear they have mech-zeratul skins ?
People can see an alarak ofc why play a hero your enemies can see coming.
He should be playing perma ghost nova then.
MairBear this game and its minigames are some kind of special hell designed just for me.
Its odd for some reason on top of everything being terrible with dropbox and its shitty site.
Its also started lagging like hell while copying links.
MoonWolf re my lrt.
I still dk if Haggard Hawks is a factual twitter or not.
That last tweet is factual at least.
Okay well we have eekhoorntjesbrood.
I don't know if its actually the english word he used for it.
But its a mushroom and the translation is correct.
Today on Persona 5 Great Googly Moogly It's All Gone To Shit part two You Thought That Was My Real Final Dungeon?
Did you catch up to the its not spoilers because we've known this from before the game came out fully bit where you get betrayed and arrested yet ?
Oh ages ago.
Oh i half figured that would be like the endgame.
You get out you do one more Big Thing.
And thats it.
Big Thing as in kill the god of death that is actually the moon.
Or whateve ryou want to summarize the end of p4 with.
I don't want to give anything away that wouldn't already be expected of a Persona game.
But I think I do at least know who the actual boss is? But I still wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Have you been told about mythological possibly very japanese figure thats ruining everything else because of the collective subconcious ?
I don't really know what that one means.
Just had a botmatch game where the reds got triple the amount of takedowns and their varian got voted mvp.
MoonWolf OH GOD.
They're a dickbutt chariot... and it's flanked with two things that are just the tip...
Called Torn King of Desire D8.
Could not make this shit up.
And Mara Tips.
MoonWolf 80g for you?
Would people be up for doing the nexus challenge thingymajig one of these nights?
Yes and yes.
GlennCuttlefish I'd love to on Friday or over the weekend.
Class tomorrow and too blargh to do it tonight Dx.
Sure. Friday ok with everyone?
Saturday I think I am out drinking.
Ffriday is fine.
GlennCuttlefish> well of course you will be saturday is eurovision and eurovision is drinking.
What is it?
But no friends birthday is on saturday.
MoonWolf Paladin getss the yogg-saron tryouts.
I went up vs a rogue.
It's amazing how controlled spells with random minions are infinitely more valuable than random spells killing your own minions u.
I'm watching this HS podcast where theyre discussing NA venues for the Spring season HCT.
They can't say a sentence without Buffalo Wild Wings.
TIL protons neutrons and electrons are polyamorous.
Oops china just broke.
“As I brought in writers I basically took them on this weird journey where I brought them over to my house and I designed this weird course where I would load up the original Metal Gear and I would have the writer play that for a while and just teach them this idea of stealth gameplay”.
And t hen i made them watch chip iand ironicus lps.
Oh hell no.
After showing both extreme Vogt-Roberts would have the potential writer fire up Metal Gear Solid on PSOne which he said is easy for newcomers to pick up and “makes a strong thesis” in the first hour. After that he’d make them play Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty.
By extremes he means going from MG to MGS5.
I can finally contemplate Nier.
MairBear MairBear.
MairBear You have lived your whole life for this singular purpose.
Can't believe we sat around a week watching streamers throwing 1000g at tavern brawl waiting for this one...
MoonWolf I'm up to the point of anime hell where a fight lasts two hours and gnome is just quietly singing in the background.
Oh god lemsip is so sweet.
!note I'm up to the point of anime hell where a fight lasts two hours and gnome is just quietly singing in the background <- have you reached anime hell 2 yet ?
TIL there is an episode of Voyager where The Rock wrestles Seven of Nine o_0.
I think that was one of his first cameos.
Nvm he was in That 70s show first.
And thats when anime became prohibited.
RIP Jenkins.
Honestly if you explode jenkins hard enough hism ates should die from bone shrapnel and shock damnit.
But they specifically said death from sympathy in this case.
Battle cannons not being good at anti-infantry and instead being really good vs monsters + tanks is OK.
As long as Eradicator / Punishers can kill men.
Also tanks can split fire as well.
Will need to add sponsons back to my tanks.
Hellhound wont be able to shoot people around corners anymore.
Also you might like the combi weapon and twin-linked changes.
We don't know that yet.
Oh its already up.
Only -1 to hit for moving and shooting a heavy weapon.
Cooked_Auto what colour do you do your tracks on russes and stuff? black or lead-belcher / boltgun metal?
Prior to weathering.
Black - Lead Belcher -> Nuln Oil.
I don't actually do all that much weathering. Or haven't at least. A bit too uncertain about not overdoing it.
But otherwise my tracks are just the standard metal with Leadbelcher - Nuln Oil - Runefang steel for highlight.
Do you paint -> glue or glue -> paint?
Vehicles Assemble components -> Base -> Paint. Infantry Assemble body -> Base -> Paint. Keeping the arms separate.
I should drink some whisky so I can make a holder thing.
When I painted a BaC Contemptor dread I won from an auction I just drilled a hole in in the ball join of the arm and stuck that onto a cork with a paper clip rod and some glue to give me something to hold onto.
Also decided to get fancy and buy glass jars for my paint stripping P.
Helps with the smell i assume.
Green soap doesn't really smell all that bad.
But they also take a lot less space than tupperware containers.
Yeah I had a bucket of dettol I left outside when I was stripping a tank.
Yeah I've heard dettol reeks but never used it because its not available here.
But Green Soap works really well even if its slow. Not to mention I can just pour it down the drain without issue.
So one of the bigger retailers for games and computer parts and pretty much everything else sooner or later has introduced Direct to your door delivery option. Interestingly enough that's between 1800-2200. Which is a good idea I think.
Finally someone who delivers stuff for people with lives.
People are gonna get that damage thing wrong a lot I bet.
Just like people did with Destroyer weapons.
Lizards ridign even larger lizards.
Led by super old and super magical toads.
Do any of us know a ChrisIanMoss#### on bnet?
How many mutuals?
Haven't clicked accept as of yet and can't check in this state I think D.
I just generally just deny all friend requests unless someone told me initially or like Steam shows that they're friends with people I know.
Or sometimes recognize the name.
Shower Thought Orks are reverse tooth fairies...
They steal errant teeth and shove them back into your face ?
Yeah not seeing that either.
I mean I know they use their own teeth for currency but that still doesnt pan out.
Cooked_Auto plz no more nu-thief.
Too bad you'll get more *and* a movie.
Yeah well fuck that.
2 Thief 2 Theivious.
Dob *friend is wondering if you wanna crash on a sofa saturday night or not.
Their sofas are comfy imo but not very long and also leather or at least faux.
I imagine I'll be heading back to mine after.
Unrelatedly they sent me this Pharmercy gif.
That is a good gif.
Well that was a round. Solo queued and got paired with a 5stack.
They pick reasonable team composition.
And ask me to go mercy.
And they were good.
It will never happen again.
You probably hallucinated that one tbf.
This is the one good game of overwatch you will ever play.
Hahaha win an unfavoured matchup against a jade druid.
A recent opponent would like to be your friend.
Immediate line of random russian followed by friend removal.
Good grief.
MoonWolf halp. I got the 80g quest the other day right?
But every other quest I've got for the last week has been play 50 class cards.
I can't help you with that!
Tell Jeff From The Overwatch Team he's in control now right?
I'm not talking to jeff from the overwatch team untill we get asuka d.va.
Cooked_Auto so I'm kitbashing some Empire Greatswords with some Skitarii bits and leftover Scions / Guard to make some Inquisitorial guys and also a Blanchesque SWA team know any other kits with good bits?
Relatedly Cadians are fat gits their arms / legs / torsos are waaaaay larger than skitarii / greatsword bits |.
Welcome to kit age differences P.
Probably just skip old Cadian and try some of the newer ones like the Command Squad you might get some milageout of the Catachan one but still a pretty old kit.
Also I got a 12+ year old pack of 20 cadians on ebay right?
My god the mold-lines.
New ones ?
There hasnt been a new Cadian kit in ages.
They just went from 20 to 10 pack.
The guys who come with vehicles are smaller than regular cadians closer to skitarii / gs sizes.
Looks odd if you put regular cadian arms on them.
Yeah I figure.
Plasma Gunner is Scion Arms on a Valkyrie Door gunner body Inquisitor is Scion arms and head on a Grey Knight body and Naval officer is Vehicle commander weapon arm on officer body.
Isn't a grey knight supposed to be at least a head taller than that ?
Yeah that is why some people convert marines into 'truescale' models.
Welcome to Power Squatting Marines.
At some point I'll get around painting these guys that I picked up from the FLGS from someone who dumped some stuff on them since he was moving away.
I really should've grabbed the three HWTs as well in that box in hindsight but I get the feeling they're gone by now or something.
Are those assault marines + sigmarines?
Yes pretty sure they're supposed to be truescale marines built from sigmarines.
It sure looks like kitbashed sigmarines.
I guess with the kilts you'd want to make them grey wolves ?
Probably just go with Blood Ravens like the rest of my marines.
Bit out of character but sure.
I mean I could paint them as Ultramarines to fit with the Greco-Roman style otherwise.
But then they'd just stand out.
If you were super good at detailing you could feather the large part of cloth and then paint the accents in red.
That'd be pretty blood ravens.
It is a bit of a shame the guy who made them didn't go for Blood Angel jetpacks.
Actually is there even an official tabletop paintscheme for them ?
Blood Ravens? Yeah.
I wasn't sure since i think they are basically a videogame invention.
There is one in an old painting guide from a few years back and then they released this in time for DoW3 release.
Which isn't too different from that I've been using.
Your image guide seems to just be more advanced techniques and colour use.
Both are pretty basic.
It's just that the picture guide doesnt mention using the washes for recess shading like the video does.
Which threw me for a loop a bit tbh.
Which is why these guys look a lot darker than the Dread I finished a while ago.
The captain has more weapons than hands.
Sadly I dont have any decent pictures of the other Sergeant which got both his hands magnetized.
Which I then kinda bungled up so I can never get any cohesive mangetization done v.
Intert joke about magnets and how they work.
More like I keep forgetting which is the right polarization and such so it means that guy in the first squad I did can't really share weapons with anyone else and I'm having a similar issue with the second guy despite my best attempts.
MairBear MoonWolf around what time are we doing that hots thing?
Are we or are we not doing it with noelor i forgot.
If no noelor anytime both of you have time.
This picture is fucken gold.
I am not sure noelor has said anything about it but I cant remember if they were even around when I asked.
I just checked no noelor.
So whenever MairBear has time i suppose.
Erm give me a bit but then I'll hop on.
The sun is indeed a deadly laser.
Fetching a drink and something solid to accompany it so 10 mins or so? Then on the way.
What now? err I'll try to be done with this round in 10 minutes.
With this team I guess we can lose in 5 so no worries there.
....My *friend is drawing fanart of me.
I think its just art at that point Noelor.
I mean yes.
But I'm not going to correct them.
Thats not very Noelor of you.
I mean they're a fan of me.
At least I'd hope they are.
Noelor fanfics when?
MairBear do poems count?
I think they've written poems about/to me.
Noelor that's so 3.
The closes I've got is character art for campaigns.
CLng is the vba function to change a variable that is not a long int into one.
Obviously this is particularly relevant for converting floats.
It is t erribly named.
When the fractional part is exactly 0.50 CLng always rounds it to the nearest EVEN number emphasis mine.
Oh its bankers rounding.
No it is i'm just misremembering.
The method should really be named very differently.
Whoops cut my finger getting my new ram out of the box.
You'd think a veteran warhammer modeller would know how to not to that.
VBA's mod operator works weirdly also.
The smaller number has to be greater than 1 or it throws out division by 0 errors.
And setting it *to* 1 always returns 0.
Incidentally VBA doesn't have a Float variable type just calls it Decimal.
And the conversion functions are CDec and CDbl.
MairBear I am back.
MoonWolf so you know how NA had a happy ending...of sorts.
Also you know how there is a nier automata concert coming up?
And I assume you know the saying Trolled by kavia.
Funny story in that.
One of the scripts of the plays had a sad ending.
Funny indeed. Its like this thing is written by some madman.
And then it turns out they intentionally leaked WRONG SCRIPTS.
Damn I missed that one I meant to talk about this a while back but you were still in the middle of the game.
I pity my enemy team that round.
We are on attack.
Our team is 3x pharmercy.
We had the first point before they knew what hit them.
Join a double actiuon boogaloo server 2 minutes later server population halves. This happened 3 times in a row now today. Dead game is dead. also full of casuals.
You are too good at this casual game.
I mean I only have a few years more experience than most of these players since it plays almost exactly like the specialists but still.
MairBear did you want that last match done or did you do it alone without me like the judas you might be.
Loving today's crippling of our NHS because they're still running XP and/or haven't run windows update in 2 months...
GlennCuttlefish I have to do it with you like the judas I am not. But just making foodstuff.
Fair enough I have dinner soon as well.
GlennCuttlefish that being said ready to the thing? I ate most of it while eating it P.
ERm while cooking*.
And one item took hella long so just got done now.
Aaa just got my dinner sorry.
Give me like 10-20 minutes.
Shout at me when done o I'll go butcher many greenskins.
Ok MairBear I finished eating.
GlennCuttlefish I finished orc murder.
Thats not the sound chocobo make.
Replaying WC3 because fucking burnout.
Tilts me having to boot up youtube to watch the cinematics because 15 yr old game on modern hardware.
In fact how DO you have that much sex.
I'm not even asking how do you have the endurance.
How do you have the TIME.
Thats life consuming amounts of sex.
The only one who knows is...
We've been spelling it wrong all this time.
That exo-lord looks pretty bamf.
I really need to order one of their heavy weapons for my Taurox.
I don't understand talk in English please? English only? WTF is this racism?! .... people. pls.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish.
Memetastic from the first minute.
We use almost all of them except fucking Keen Flurry.
MairBear that healer with the the amazing benefiction.
Love that guy.
Laughed so hard I almost cost us the game. overtime in ilios well.
Our lucio pushed their mccree in the well.
A sad whistle could be heard as he fell down.
Time for Netherlands in ESC.
No clogs yet.
Cooked_Auto no clogs at all we only send serious stuff.
But what they do have otoh is an incredibly boring song.
The Netherlands entry is boring as all hell and generic to boot.
Waiting for my weekend game to start so watching the ESC stream.
Well that was sad.
Got outhealed by enemy teams lucio.
Then again it makes sense since NOBODY ELSE WAS ANYWHERE NEAR THE POINT.
Well I have officially now played too much hots.
All duplicates in this crate.
Oh what the crap Nier >C.
Boss fight concludes but can't save because download not finished. D8.
Cooked_Auto shame GW are so anal about using non-GW plastic in their stores while also not having a good variety of human models /.
Pretty sure that depends on the store and it should just be majority GW components.
MairBear just as you wanted to hear my live commentary in VLR I want to hear your commentary on nier at some point.
It'll be dry till I clear that demo segment a third time.
Blegh sounds dreadful.
Thats the worst area in the game imo.
Guess what area also has shitload of sidequests?
8.5 hours of installing.
So I'll play it tomorrow it seems.
Buuut I'll bug you when I'm ready to go.
Bug me too.
So I have now met noelor's Friend. Can confirm they exist.
They are also a shite eurovision host.
Holy shit Sweden's act at the Melodifestivalen stage was going with fucking beautiful.
I know they remarked about the freaking but didnt parse it as 'yeah f-word guys'.
My skype friends who watched it mostly thought it was disappointing and lost their shit at I think the Ukranine one.
I was too busy having a miserable time in A3 to check the stream so I missed most of the entires after the Justin Operalake.
They are also a shite eurovision host <- harsh.
MoonWolf I'm awake and starting up Nier.
Be there in a moment.
My phone says 16C vOv.
Its really quite nice here.
Just a Mackerel.
GlennCuttlefish re 9s in a dress.
Egads it booted up again.
Why wouldn't it?
Glenn still lives!
MoonWolf well you know how there was that ransomware that infected half of british NHS?
It dawned to me I havent actually updated my windows since somewhere around windows 10 launch.
So I installed that security update.
I see you fled mumble mair.
Have fun with it resetting settings.
EDF! EDF!
Now it’s time to fight! In the name... OF SCIENCE!
Bunnies are a liquid.
Eeyup its time for shorts.
One thing bothers me about this games sound design.
Its mostly the usual bleeps and bloops you know artificial sounds that fit the game.
Except for the chickens.
For some reason this game has hyper realistic high definition surround cawwing for the chickens.
MairBear Morganna is the Angriest Cat. But at least I like him. Unlike teddie who i hate. Deeply.
Is that the superhero cat from P5?
Morgana is great!
It's go to sleep cat.
In the lp i'm watching he's currently tutorializing the hell of out the protagonist.
MairBear also the fake gun can shoot bullets because the demons believe its a real gun.
But the demons apparantly also believe in very strict realistic bullet counting rules.
MoonWolf it doesn't make sense to me beyond that a very few enemies are weak to bullets.
A whole clip is just barely more than an auto attack at times.
The commenters mentioned it was mostly to produce knockdowns for all out attacks ?
If the enemy is weak to bullets then it knocks em down and you only need 1 bullet per enemy.
And later in the game you can unlock and ability for MC only to spend half his bullets to knock down a non-boss.
Really wish i could play this game.
Or there was a good LP that was faster.
Because damn this lp updates slow.
I want new/more party members.
I hate the Junpei's.
Every persona game has a junpei.
And i never like them.
Not that I disagree.
MoonWolf do you mean Vulgar Boy as he was first known?
Anyone up for HotS tonight?
I'll play some games of hots.
But they patch in the final stpe of the thing tomorrow.
I haven't done this week's yet.
Spent all weekend with my *Friend.
Watching Riverdale or YouTube or Eurovision or Steven Universe.
Dob called them a terrible eurovision host.
Not sure what that was about.
Not taking it as 100% seriously as Dob takes it.
>taking eurovision seriously.
Anathema I know.
But c'est le Dob.
Btw there is a chance of no DW this week since my illness has returned.
Funny enough some of my skype friends were livid over the ESC results P.
Anathema take care of yourself friebd.
Autocorrect never helps when it needs too.
It changed would to werewolf earlier.
So I said I werewolf love to do something or other.
You can tell they're better because they don't have that Darth Vader mouthpiece any more.
Otoh also not beaks?
I never really liked the beaks.
You do not besmirch the beakie >|.
It's followed closely by the Wolf.
Pretty sure that's the mk4 Heresy era helmet.
The only adjective I associate with wolves is hungry like.
Wolf helmet in this case not too surprising where its from really.
They don't look half bad I think.
Hell they might even be some good painting practive for me with lots of open spaces.
Such a lazy addition to the setting.
'they are space marines but even bigger and stronger'.
'and they have boltguns but better'.
Only difference is that Boltrifle gets extra 6 range and AP -1.
Pretty sure these are pretty much truescale marines.
Last thing the game needs is more marines too.
Wouldn't surprise me if this isn't the new faction they've hinted about but we'll see.
We'll get the 8th release date before the end of the month so.
Anathema now we can have grey knights that are even MORE SPECIAL than regular marines.
Would be fine if they were just 'truescale marine models' everything else about them is bad.
Eh better to do it like that than suddenly heavily imply that everyones massive marines armies are kinda invalidated now because they're all using older models.
Why would people think that? new plastic kits didn't invalidate old ones or old metal models which can be noticibly smaller.
Because people are idiots.
Don't cater to idiots.
Well I'd say they aren't in this case but that wont make grogs stop complaining. One of my favourite 40k hangouts is already full on shitposting about it so.
You seem to have misunderstood Games Workshop's business model anathema.
Well its certainly a better business model than the one they had a year ago.
People *like* GW now for real.
The hecks did that happen?
CEO got replaced.
Which is why you suddenly have things like GW on FB and Twitch shows and so on.
If they are going to shit all over the established setting this way tey could atleast also say btw these new marines can be ladies too.
Just give them female heads who cares.
I had forgotten how much this cat thing freaks me out in aria.
I still need to make that female inquisitor in GK terminator armor at some point for this and giggles.
The biggest nerds.
Noelor the helmets are mk4 ones.
That means you can add Primaris Space Marines to your Ultramarines Dark Angels Space Wolves Blood Angels Iron Hands *Rainbow Warriors* or any other Codex Chapter you like even one of your own invention. snerk.
I think I use too many chat programs with their own text encode options v.
Has the new CEO done anything to allow people not to bankrupt themselves because their army went obsolete again?
Well their fault for liking WHFB P.
I meant more what broke me out of it last time. 'nid codex shite etc.
How well Nidz and Orkz behave remains to be seen but the release seems to be soon anyway.
Were people planning on dong that hots thing today?
Yeah just finishing up dinner and grabbing a drink.
GlennCuddlefish booting up now.
MairBear are you doing this hots thing too ?
Dinners gonna be late for me so after that's gone I'll join in.
But that's in an age U.
MoonWolf cancel that. I have time for a game before food!
After your next thing is done I mean. xP.
Get in here then.
MoonWolf because you left my extra player will be playing as Coa Gulary.
I hate that name.
If only you'd stuck around to protest on mumble.
Praise the Icosahedrax.
!note MairBear the new 'start collecting' bundles are actually cheaper than buying the things separate unlike basically every other bundle.
Cooked_Auto did you notice on the guns for the primaris marines the scope sight just looks directly at the iron sight?
I feel dirty. Ended up spending resources on stimpacks for hots not money I request one of you shoots me the day I pay for frivolous DLC such as this.
Anathema Ah yeah I saw something about that with some mockups.
I swear every time I launch AdiIRC it creeps a couple of pixels down and right.
MairBear in a year it'll migrate off of your screen forever.
Oh no /o\.
MairBear posted witht he title optimal mara moveset.
Meanwhile in Oracle is crazy news.
This report exported as raw text only despite clearly being designed as a spreadsheet has non-ascii unicode characters inserted at the beginning of afaict random lines.
Noelor fuck oracle.
Ok I'm now even more confused.
Because I tried to use VBA to remove that character wherever it appears.
And it's ASCII 12.
Which is an unreadable character except when it's the female sign?
That sounds like its in the controll characters range.
Its line feed.
Ok I'm very out of my depth here... it's what?
Back in ye olde days when we still thought of text in terms of typewriters.
Not that I need to know I guess I think I can still remove it.
There was a difference between moving down a line line feed and moving to the start of a line carriage return.
Always curious though.
And depending on os you handled newlines differently.
Windows and dos traditionally use CR and then LF.
Unix uses just an LF.
The old mac before os x used a single CR.
Now why your oracle is leaking random LF's i have no clue.
Probably some weird oracle db to windows spreadsheet interaction.
But thats not really very enlightning insight.
Well I think the report I'm getting is the raw text version of a report designed to be printed.
And look like a spreadsheet when it *is* printed.
Might want to filter out extranious tabs then too.
So.... weird tabulating effects yeah.
Oh I'm already dealing with whitespace.
Luckily it's all space rather than tabs.
Thanks for info <3.
Also the comments above the line that clears those characters out is now there are extra linefeed characters sometimes because... Oracle's a mess?
If I were a touch memier I'd also include iiam.
But instead you just thought you could do that but didn't.
Like a professional.
One of these days I will watch hokuto no ken.
Entirely subbed from the french dub.
I dont fear death but the absurdity of this fight terrifies me.
Could be a line in any JoJo tbf.
Noelor image.
Anathema i'm not feeling it honsetly.
But whatever works for you.
New Death Guard.
Starter box for 8th is all but confirmed to be Marines vs Death Guard with a bunch of plaguezombies and cultists.
<- great now you really can make your own sonic OC do not steal.
MairBear i was wrong about ruyji he's not the junpei he's a weird junpei/chie clone.
<- finally you can import and export decks.
Its only 2 years late.
MoonWolf the first rage orc clip.
Not sure if I prefer the machinima scene or the doot-garrosh.
My anvil industry order arrived good thing I bought more superglue recently it's all resin.
Pretty good resin from what I can remember.
Less of a hassle to clean than the raging heroes stuff.
Yeah it looks nicer than the kromlech stuff.
Oh double update today.
They look good.
MoonWolf whoooooo! We can finish quests against each other to get them over with!
MoonWolf GlennCuddlefish FFXIV - Revolutions the new themesong is needless to say spoilers out the butt to watch. Just in case it pops up.
Though one thing I will share in Discord.
Person 3 was about how death was inevitable and sort of scary but its okay its a natural part of life.
And Persona 4 was about how we all have parts of ourselves we don't like but its okay its natural just accept it and do something healthy with it.
Persona 5 seems to be how some peoples dark sides are Seriously Fucked Up and its Not Okay. So go kill them with magic.
People are all freaks but they pretend to be normal and nice is the message I got.
From 5 ?
Isn't that basically the the message you should have gotten from 4 though.
And then this game got a fuckton darker.
Guess i know why it really has an M rating.
And its not just M for Mara.
Die Romeo they stupid asshole.
That play is great.
And will become ironically meaningfull later.
WHY is there a zombie clown apocalypse downstairs.
There are no zombie clowns mair clearly you're imagining things again.
GlennCuddlefish I am now .... doing an escort?
Clown Robot Peace Parade??
Anathema how you feeling for tonight?
I'm not ill anymore other than a mucusy throat am exhausted though. Current thought is yes.
We went up against Dimir House Guards last night and smashed them pretty good '_'b.
Really really like warning comments have spoilers for the game so do related videos.
Well they didn't rate that highly on the skeletons list.
So thats not suprising.
At least the dice were on our side for this session only two or three nat 1s I think and a whole bunch of 20s.
So the mood was good.
Jesus christ playing zeratul against bots was a bad idea.
The moment you unstealth they turn on you. all of them.
Drizzle my ass.
We barely have clouds.
It sjust 23C and nice weather.
How did you break the weather GlennCuddlefish.
Omg MoonWolf can you please feed PatternSpider the script of Arctic Alive?
If you can find me one.
Maybe it just ignores me for some reason.
Apparently it just hates cuddlefishes.
See my last retweet i mean only ifyou want too. but you might be interested ?
In any case RT'd myself and will bring it to *Friend's attention they're the outgoing one P.
The worst of all cyberfutures.
I have lime/mint lemonade and this shit is delicious.
Need to bookmark this for future use.
MairBear apparantly there's gonna be more Arrested Development next year?
Does anyone want to join me tonight in getting lootboxes through hots ?
I would but its rpg night.
Good gods. Wikihow was actually useful for once.
Was it for something mundane and normal ?
Rolling a cigarette.
Thats fairly mundane.
Wikihow tends to get weird and or terrible in the less immediately obvious things.
Anathema I'm stuck in traffic =<.
My hame isn't tonight so some of us are gonna play HotS.
Also moonwolf ?
They wanted the Baldurs Gate audience?
Pathfinder is relatively successful.
But here I doodled a shitty cat.
BwaS wanna come lost HotS with us? =D.
MoonWolf Asexual Party Girl is my next alt-pop album.
You can make any genre alt- if you're determined enough.
Kirisu i'm not sure you can do that with pop.
Because its not really a Genre as such.
Like that'll stop me.
Well you can call your music whatever you want.
People might just not agree.
Which is pretty alt- ?
Anyway happy Elliott's ace sometimes.
Whenever he feels like it.
But only if he's also a punk party girl at the same time.
Is that a typo for pink?
Because... she is not punk.
I thought she was punk-ish ?
Other than by being ace.
Queer identities are somewhat punk.
MoonWolf 'brit-pop' is apparently a genre.
But I *think* e.g. her hair colour is natural in that world she doesn't have any extraneous piercings or tattoos etc.
Also she's just supposed to be the genre cliche of Tony Stark young Bruce Wayne et al.
Popular party girl who couldn't possibly be that very serious superhero.
Lets ignore that in this case the superhero is a cheerleader.
The Velma lookalike is Clark Kent or Peter Parker and then the other form is uh... the 90s.
Jesus christ can I get non-cancerous teams for once in this game.
Alternatively an enemy team that is as unorganized as mine.
Instead of this ridiculous horsefuckery.
Last round it was 3 winstons a mercy a torb and a bastion just yucking it up on the payload.
Brit pop has been a genre since forever.
Mostly gets used for blur oasis and less so the who the stones the beatles.
The Velma lookalike is Clark Kent or Peter Parker and then the other form is uh... the 90s <- thats one way to describe that form.
BwaS it is definitely not any of those last three but ok.
To quote a friend A channel showing a machine learning AI programmed in Python trying to drive in GTA V through image analysis..
Apparantly the machine lessons did not involve things like speed limits.
Apparently the chat's canon is the driver is Charles a fish desperate to return to the sea.
Due to how often they drown in canals/oceans.
Currently charles seems to be trying to use a traintrack as a road.
Its not working.
Sick stunt there.
Yeah that was impressive honestly.
Welp. Ordered a GW book from their webstore to be sent to the GW store in Stockholm to be picked up by a friend a while ago for him to send it my way. Turns out he then threw in an Orcs Goblins army book and an old metal Chaos Daemon Prince v.
Old metal Chaos Daemon Prince <- sweet.
No clue if its worth anything but it sounds sweet.
He looks goofy as hell.
This guy.
Oh that is old.
That is old as fuck.
When they were still doing daemons as more judeochristian demons.
Rather than the current chaos stuff.
Such a shame I hate painting metal models v.
Its a rad model though.
This is better driving than I can manage in gran turismo thats for sure.
BwaS honestly i swear gran turismo is harder than actually driving a car.
Real cars don't do the shit that happens in that game.
Granted i played GT when I was like 10.
And got a driving license a decade later.
Hm I have one of these I could send him for shits and giggles in return.
I guess the shoddy paintjob and low definition modelling kinda fits death guard aesthetic.
Also a 3rd edition model or something in the likes of that.
Late 90's at least.
3rd edition had barely started in the late 90s iirc.
Yup our king has a Another Job.
As his hobby.
Well work can be rewarding.
So why not.
Get in touch with the commoners and so on.
Nah piloting is still a rich person hobby.
But you still get to be amongst the commoners at least for a while just dont interact with them.
I was sure it was already established he was a pilot.
We know he's a pilot and we know he flies to keep his licenses current.
Because they require a certain amount of hours per year which is reasonable.
So it was just that he did KLM commuter flights that was 'bombshell'?
Its just some anecdotes of him talking about doing some commercial flights through KLM.
To think they're on 8 and I haven't played since 5th and even then that was only a few games at most.
You didn't miss much with 7th.
It was pretty much 6.5.
7th was a mess.
<< erm.
Really scraping the bottom of that barrel.
Anathema 7th was a mess - And yet I have a scottish friend who spits nothing but bile whenever 8th comes up v.
Cooked_Auto are they a Tau player?
Nope Former Nid and current Eldar player.
Oh Eldar was my next guess.
But she is incredibly salty about 8th whenever it comes up.
MoonWolf I guess him sitting copilot on a plane that says it's his on the side is ironic or something?
7th is incredibly unbalanced a fucking chore to write a list for a chore to play filled with WAAC netlisting shitheads.
I haven't read the article yet but KLM is literally royal airlines or something right?
Formations were a neat idea but the execution is terrible and they are one of the main reasons for the balance issues.
Rules are spread over about 40 thousand different books.
Meanwhile my friend sneers over the AoS style datasheets and everything related to that and the rules.
Your friend can eat a bag of dicks p.
At which point discussing anything 40k related is a chore and feels like a politics discussion more often than not.
The datasheets thing means they can adjust points values separate from the rules for a unit so they can balance way faster instead of having to wait for a whole new codex.
I am going to laugh my ass off if it turns out that Nids are playable in 8th.
Cooked_Auto just tell them Wraithknights and Scatbikes need to cost at least 50% more points.
And GMC shouldn't be immune to poison.
But considering the rumor is that preorders are starting next week it's not long now.
GMCs aren't a thing anymore afaik.
I can literally drive my Leman Russ closer so I can hit them with my sword 10/10 new edition best edition.
Operation Meat Touch.
Yeah that seems a good objective to reach.
I haven't read the article yet but KLM is literally royal airlines or something right? <- KLM does stand for royal airlines. roughly. but the Konkinglijk Royal title/predicate is more a recognition of importance to the country and a badge of honour.
Rather than an ownership thing.
Over here we have things that are royal which are varyingly connected to the royalty.
And then also a bunch of companies have royal appointments.
So idk Cadburys chocolate will say on the side royal provider of chocolate to HRH Elizabeth II or something.
Kirisu those are Hofleverancier.
Which translates roughtly to royal provider yeah.
Court provider really.
What the hell Jade. What. The Hell.
Watch latest xcom2 video.
Will it undo the fuking terrible ending choice though ?
Do they ever?
But the ending of that game series was a pretty big punch in the gut.
For no good reason.
Either undo basically everything that happened in the game by undoing the first real action you took in the first game.
Or a small town gets wiped out of existance.
Oh come on Life is Stranger was obviously staring you in the face.
I especially hate the ending because it basically rubs the message trying to chance things or help people is meaningless fuck you for doing it.
Into your face.
Sounds like SteinsGate.
Never played any of the wordword games.
It involves a lot of words.
Nah piloting is still a rich person hobby.
And thats what I get for cleaning keys without turning the keyboard off.
Hey at least you managed an old sentence.
Last time i did that it was just random letters and characters.
Well good newsis that my keyboard is now cleaner.bad news is that it still refuses to work properly.
Good thing I am a hoarder and have a backup keyboard.
MoonWolf yeah the moral seemed to be no fuck you teens the world *does* suck.
We gave you agency but using it was a mistake in fact everytime you tried to use it made everything worse and now this town is literally doomed.
Is your girlfriend really worth an entire town of people?
No but fuck dontnod for asking that question to start with.
Also side bonus.
Either way max gets to live with crippling guilt!
Anathema So going by the buzz from the GW QA stream all transports are now classified as assault vehicles.
So Halo's finally coming back to PC then cool.
I like the models vs units for transports.
Aria Started watching for the anime girls doing absolutely nothing thrilling stayed for the ara ara's.
GlennCuttlefish Noelor you guys said you were ok with next wednesday for DW?
>rename Battle.net to 'the Blizzard app'.
>host non-Blizzard games.
About battling at that.
Clearly Des-two-ny will have a sequel in a snowstorm.
MoonWolf why am I watching a Star Wars boss in the *first* Kingdom Hearts game?
That is before Disney had the trademarks for lightsabers.
Because keyblades were a terrible analogy for The Force all along.
If you say so.
Wait untill you see Birth By Sleep.
You'll see i'm right.
I'm still on KH1.
That thing will probably go up 5 months from now.
But when it does!
Though it's at a weird point of the timeline where May's started playing KH2...
I'll get to see the context of the great MoonWolf-inspired cucking joke of 2017.
You'll get to see me link shipping charts.
But won't get to ese the actual chart though.
Next time i'll make it ascii art then.
Now THIS one I could get behind buying.
GlennCuttlefish hell of a lot of player corpses in that boss arena preceded by NPC corpsex.
Err...where was this again?
Cant remember npc corpsex.
Fighting in that white fake-city vs Adam.
Ah ok. On harder difficulties those fights tend to have some moves that oneshot you.
Also the Pople Purple pope robits.
Infinite spawning enemies.
<- oh boy oh boy oh boy.
I can't wait to ge ta free terrible card.
Steiner just can't deal.
Boy do they ever.
Persona Babe Ruth.
It lacks the most important command in that situation Cooked_Auto Despair.
Is that a command ?
In p5? probably not but it should be in that situation.
<- if anyone ever wanted MORE NierA hacking minigame.
Ps What the hell is this.
Man that bot never gets it quite right.
Regional weather services would be much better but i'm not programming 10 different weather services into it.
The thermometer in my house is at 24c in shade.
Mine is pretty accurate.
If it wasn't so cloudy it would be really nice.
But instead its just meh.
Whats wrong with cloudy.
Nothing i'd just prefer it to be about 5C warmer so i could have the doors open.
13c sounds like you could leave the doors open to me.
Yeah well i'm from the exotic and hot country known as the netherlands.
<- aaaah yeah brainscoop is finally doing The Good Stuff again.
Anathema Discover the future of Games Workshop related table-top roleplay games.
Love that change to Chainswords.
MoonWolf why are Auriel's Q and W the wrong way round though.
They are not ?
Several people have died because I've scarf-swept them instead of healing them.
Or because my heal's on cooldown after throwing it at an enemy.
I can't say i've ever confused them that way.
It's very consistent for me.
And she's the only char it happens that way on?
My brain just can't click onto healing being in the middle.
Uthers aoe heal is on w.
And his single is on q.
I don't play Uther much.
But that one actually makes sense.
It's that it's damage - heal - damage.
MairBear Takemi sure is a responsible adult who certainly isn't liable to kill you with horrible experiments.
...my what a ringing endorsement.
Takemi is best.
Totally romancing her on NG+.
...any idea how Auriel's crown interacts with Rexxar?
Well if you're into slightly murderous punk women in really short dresses with chockers i am.
MoonWolf you have my interest.
Noelor you can crown rexxar or his pet.
And it only works for the one you crowned.
May stick with Leoric then.
See if he keeps the crown while dead.
I have no tried that yet.
My party is those two Rag and D.Va.
Its weird how persona 5 is like yeah you can data basically any female social link.
Including the ones you really shouldn't.
Like your teacher.
But No Gays Allowed.
Japan I guess.
The only overtly gay characters in that one are sadly comical stereotypes.
Get a round of hollywood where we start stomping the defenders almost clear to point B.
Unexpected server error occurred.
Oh fuck you.
Can't believe how the client front-end runs so contrary to the other established ones.
There's one other character where it's not as hinted as Kanji was but he implied to my eye that he doesn't much care for women at least. But that =/= gay.
Type out your battletag and authenticator code in full every fucking single attempt.
Which doesn't help when you're just chain dc-ing on it.
MairBear there is just so little excuse for it though. they're wiling to go for onscreen suicide attempts implied rape of a student by a teacher exceedinly oversexualized schoolgirls in basically no clothing actually naked fake people.
But a gay person is just one step to far ?
Also annoyed at how even the badass female character still has skin-tight biker leathers. But at least no gratuitious boob window.
Oh come on now.
Valeera's fucking weird btw.
Though tbf I don't play assassins much in general.
That's the closest I've seen any of them.
Its like playing a wow rogue.
You fail to kill people and then you vanish!
But you only get combo points on heroes.
You hide uselessly until one enemy is low on hp. Then you gank them and vanish.
And your only dot is garotte.
Which is terrible because it breaks your CC?
No it's terrible because it requires stealth so is rarely useable.
Because your only CC is also stealth-only.
And you're too squishy to actually fight for the whole cooldown of vanish?
Maybe it's just that I'm bad.
Could be both.
Otoh when I *did* get her level the box was worth it.
Gordon Ramsay is a fuck who only knows how to cook British the most scathing criticism.
Oh the guy has *two* lightsabers!
Incontinent What the UK is until Brexit happens. - My dad professes to have come up with that one.
I'm not sure of the inflection of that woooow but thanks I think!
Otoh when I *did* get her level the box was worth it < --WAS IT THOUGH.
Its a custom taro cat drugs.
There was also Bot drugs.
The Become as Gods segment was pretty rad as hell.
I know No Limit is built for these kinds of things but when 4/6 of blue roll sniper and 6/6 of red roll sniper it's incredibly dull.
Twitter has assigned all its accounts gender.
Based on... interests????????????
Betting it made you a 13-54 year old male like it did everyone else.
Just fucking look at my profile though?
Twitter doesn't know what its users actually use their profiles for.
It's right there like it is on 50% of profiles?
Look there first though.
Certainly doesn't look there to see if it has words like cis or queer or pronouns in there.
Shoot the internet.
Anathema how's mastodon?
I don't disagree.
MairBear i did not see shadow kamoshidas little transformation coming.
You mean you weren't expecting a Stupid Looking BossTM?
I wasn't expecting the girl legs sticking out all over.
Also got to the ending in Nier Automata. I was gonna do 1 more quest before side missions. Turned out that was the main quest that diabled almost all the other quests xD.
I expected to get at least one more chance to side-quest ^^.
Now you have to wait untill you get chapter select.
Also to quote Glenn. Happy end!
Love the affair of tilting your way through the arcade weekly loot boxes.
And only getting 1 rare up from the minimum expected value in drops yay~.
GlennCuttlefish MoonWolf.
Noelor in the cute gay trans-human future handwriting is a forgotten skill.
MoonWolf makes sense tbf.
I actually really like Probius.
Even though I'm trash at it.
Welp they just played Lord of the Arena in HCT playoffs.
D.Va's level 15 portrait is just her winking.
But winking so hard she's now on lightning.
Playing wild Mage puts down flamewaker.
Plays primordial glyph.
Plays primordial glyph again... from the glyph. 3 times more. Before it gave unstable portal.
6 mana 2/4 that dealt 10 damage on summon.
I had one time firelands into burgly bully.
Got a couple of coins.
Flamewaker dump the coins few arc missiles pew pew.
But winking so hard she's now on lightning <- yo might be an anime if.
Oh shit D.Va is the protagonist of the first esports anime.
That uses the sports anime template rather than the .hack template.
She has to compete against a series of increasingly stranger and more anime teams progressing from her intermural highschool competition too the intergalactic super finals ?
I'm unsure when she gets the meka.
Halfway through season one there is a lot of flashbacks involved.
We find out about her tragic backstory.
Something something determination.
Her tragic backstory she once played Protoss.
She's an orphan later on in season 3 we learn her father is still alive and is actually a grand champion starcraft player.
BwaS 10000% yes.
Even better her father was Life.
You can turn people into cats.
So it's EGS the RPG?
No its Every Anime Ever the rpg.
You could play a season of D.va Sports Anime in it.
Ah nuts the PDF share thread doesnt seem to have it.
MoonWolf holy shit KH2's version of Seifer.
What the absolute dicks.
I have no awnsers.
I also mean the dialogue though.
Oh gods even the shadows have more zippers now.
Pretty sure those are nobodies you are talking about.
This is peak Nomura.
Are they white and thrusting strangely ?
Also sparking yes.
Then they are nobodies.
It turned into card games when it died.
The game after this birth by sleep has even more not quite nobodies called unversed.
Because kingdom hearts is bad.
Entities that are not versed.
They were versed and now are not.
I believe that they were never versed.
Wow this is very Christopher Lee also.
Well then they aren't unversed are they.
Its like uneducated.
Only with versing.
The name is never explained.
That this kid's vest says DOG STREET has put Dogsong into my head.
And thats okay.
Does your mental version of that song include money money money lyrics though ?
So anyway last time we streamed this game it ended 5 times.
She's not even joking.
It just kept having endings.
I got a duplicate hero so I finally have enough triangles for D.Va's announcer pack \o/.
Why the hell is there not an Innkeeper announcer pack.
I mean I'd hate it but.
Is this... the gambler from FF6?
Computerguava is amazing.
Nice got a frog lució.
Jades guava fuckery gets better and better.
Yeah this is good.
I'm glad we are in agreement.
Moar carbot OW.
Why is Harem Chromie.
BwaS and I are up against a 4-stack =v.
Two sub level 20's.
Lol we have no warrior =v.
You're tough =v.
Oh no not sex at cons!
No non persona SMT sex allowed.
Or Persona 1-2.
Those are also... insufficiently sexy?
Well can you name single waifu from either one?
I can't name any from 5 either.
And from 3-4 it's like... Aigis?
And domme fencer lady.
Wwell whaddya know.
The 4 stack gave Epic to their pocket Morales.
The Morales who got caught out a couple times and took upgraded stim drone at 20.
She was value for them though.
Knew how to grenade f'rex.
And domme fencer lady <- how do you know she might like to relax a little and sub.
This is true.
I'd forgotten how open the duelling celestials map was somehow.
Oh cool I just got Arthas in a chest.
I've had a fair few heroes dropping from chests.
If this wasn't the first.
It was the first that I wanted.
And wasn't a dupe sure.
Man we are getting so so owned rn.
Yep that was a crap game.
Overextensions never soaking wonderful.
Not to mention blind luck to win in a scenario where they get camp invaded.
I mean I soaked for the first 6 or so levels.
Zul's just not great at it.
...wait why have I seen these last 2 episodes.
Started season 2 of aria after finishing season 1 and I am sure I have seen these episodes.
Lol the dva charging in on thrusters at the GG screen too late to save her core from a 25 minute boss.
Ok I think I know whats happened here. When my friend showed me first couple of episodes back in the day it seems she accidentally showed the second season episodes 1-x.
While their 26-minute boss was at our first fort.
And now I have to actually watch episodes 1-2 of season 1.
Nah I think our forts were gone.
But we def had keeps while all 3 our lanes had cats.
I mean geographically.
We late boss'd better than them.
Cant believe we fucking lost to ambush hammer and evolve monstrosity abathur.
Oh yeah convenient double warrior protect the president comp.
Oh yeah teamfighting xul.
Yeah I as tyrande doing more siege and xp than xul on fucking shrines.
Mid-bot-mid-bot ignore obj easy life.
Yeah I as tyrande doing more siege and xp than xul on fucking shrines <- xul is doing it wrong.
I KNOW RIGHT!
I mean i love tyrande and she can do some real damage if you build her for it.
But she's not specialist or assassin.
Right 1 last round.
Then i can be done with QM until the next cancer cash grab.
Oh look red gets artanis on battlefield how fucking convenient.
HAHAHAHA oh genius let's commend 10 death zigzag for their hero dmg contribution.
Well the overwatch nexus crates were a mei legendary and about 600 gold and not much else.
BwaS more than i got.
Not that I have a specific character niche in this game but I have 7 chars over level 5 and 4 are specialists.
As is my highest 5.
In vs ai and low mmr they mostly play themselves and give you satisfaction.
Sylv was one of my highest for a time before her rework.
Presented without comment.
That is one cool lizard in the latest Panic update mail.
I dare say it's radical.
Is it Gex levels of radical ?
So I bought some teriyaki sauce today since BBQ season starts now.
And when I got home I figured what the hell and made tare of my own.
And now I am at a loss what to do with the sauce I bought.
On an entirely unrelated note I swear finally finished gourmet samurai.
Its a great series go watch it.
Its a series about a japanese pensioner who just chills and eats food at various restaurants.and is happy as fuck about it.
GlennCuttlefish except when he's served cold shitty ramen. C.
Wait fuck did I miss an episode.
Where he ends up at that chinese restaurant cos the place he wanted had a queue.
Well on the positive side.
I now have one more episode to look towards to.
Sorry I was meant to stream that huh D.
You asked me to xD.
I mean if you can please.
Wait did I miss more episodes? not sure I remember all of those names. I mean its understandable since the time we usually start watching it is 6 hours into heavy drinking but.
Anathema For example a unit disembarking from a Transport is no longer prevented from charging that turn.
Well that was one of my weirdest HS wins ever.
Questing deck as priest for 'use your hero power a lot'.
That was TGT hero power enablers stall out healing and some card draw.
Won against a zoolock in fatigue.
Kabal chemist into dragonfire potion against that warlock adapt pterodactyl XD.
And still had 2 antique healbots spare at the end.
In can just imagine the warlock getting incredibly frustrated at your endless boardwipes and healing.
Heals are fun so fun.
And they did in fact adjust.
Another sfw this week.
The barbs have been bequed.
It was delicious.
I had slowcooked chicken in bbq sauce and honey.
It was also dilicious.
Incidentally even though they were drumsticks i had to eat them with knife and fork because i literally could not pick them up by the bone anymore.
It'd just all fall off.
Only proving that there is no such thing as too much marinading.
In unrelated news animal life is just a bunch of cannibalistic carbon.
I mean. yes.
That seems pretty related honestly.
Well then. I was waiting for that fight to happen in trails in the sky the 3rd.
It started out as bad as I expected. And then it got worse.
I might actually have to properly optimize for this fight.
Well had to cheese the hell out of that fight by turning half of my party into support but I did it.
FF peeps.
This costume section should be good.
Like 90% of DRKs.
He doesn't touch the tank spells.
Tanking makes you do less damage MairBear.
And thats terrible.
Healers shoul djust adjust.
Except in a level 50 dungeon etc.
I'm glad we're finally discussing the leveling playlist meta.
That swords not gonna walk itself keep moving omfg.
At least darknight has good taste in anime.
Why would you ever have to discuss leveling playlists that has been settled.
Man I need to replay revengeance.
GlennCuttlefish what has it been settled to be then ?
Need you even ask moonwolf.
It relates to certain rules.
That apply in nature.
Look after the first 2 hours thats going to be a little to much.
Are you implying linkin park wouldn't be?
They have more than 1 album.
And yet I would rather listen to revengeance ost on repeat.
Just won a vs AI game at level 10 on the first skull golem summon.
I feel sorry for the ai.
Well the next game is a very balanced affair.
Human team Auriel Ragnaro Tyrande Kael Malfurion.
Let's not think about how I typed Ragnaros that poorly.
I've already forgotten.
BwaS GlennCuttlefish.
We're all the blue team widowmaker.
The only times I ever land hits with widow are against winston/orisa/rein barriers.
Zarya bubbles is the closest it comes to actual hero hitboxes.
Now I am not upset about that cartoon.
But the main reason I have OW uninstalled again is because of red team widow bullshit.
41%/40% siege/hero damage as butcher D.
Your team might be bad if.
So the latest Gungeon update is probably the best one yet.
The title should tell youy everthing.
It doesn't though.
Also a really weird boss bug.
One of these days I will buy a top hat and a tranquilizer rifle.
I will then go out to the forest hunting for an owl.
And when I do I will stuff it in the hat. So that I can finally draw the rest of the %¤#!#### owl.
MairBear THE CAT IS A BUS.
WHY IS THE CAT A BUS.
MoonWolf because 'cognition'.
Oh god they're blaming it on Totoro.
I just finished the first non-tutorial target in Dishonored 2.
Did not kill them.
My *Friend is watching yaoi because ok and uh.
I suddenly feel the need to shitpost on tumblr.
I can see why.
!note Noelor my *Friend is watching yaoi because ok and uh <- and now everyone is going to hit on this character.
Oh boy its going to be one of those days. made the dumb decided to be dumber than a baboon and stay up all night playing videogames.
GlennCuttlefish I just didn't sleep well and feel like shit that's almost same?
Yeah pretty much. Time to enjoy this lovely spring day by being too fuzzyheaded to think and too creaky to move.
Welcome to the team.
Meanwhile I've got lawn mowing to do.
Perfect weather for it too.
Get on my level.
Well at least it's now just me that is too fuzzy to think.
I slept for like 10 hours though.
Anathema more coffee.
I only ground enough for 2 cups.
Two smallish cups too.
I don't make a lot of coffee at work now so I dose up in the morning and grab some more when I get home in the afternoon.
We have a coffee machine that is so foul I can't even look at it.
At work that is.
I could go get a nice coffee at lunch there is a cafe near here that does good coffee.
They sell lots of fancy coffee supplies too like one of those combination spoon / clips for bags.
Yeah and bags of the coffee they use. Lots of fancy food / drinks stuff really. It's quite a nice little place.
Oh no it's closed on Mondays.
Anathema oh it's that one I remember going there.
MoonWolf that's episode 6.
Everyone has already been hitting on them for some time.
This is important context that was not provided.
Oh there's no Mair.
We are indeed mairless.
!note Mairbear.
Also anathema probably ^.
That cat is new levels of lazy.
MoonWolf I managed to get my Dishonored 2 save back to Low Chaos.
It was high chaos ?
Yeah because I killed the tutorial target.
By stabbing him in the throat rather than by locking him in a safe to slowly starve to death.
Pretty sure that still killing.
And also basically all of the guards I'm the tutorial level because I didn't have magical sneak powers.
Starvation is a Low Chaos killing.
Anyway second target I cleared the first level with only one kill and second with... idk single digits.
One of those was being mean to dogs though so that doesn't count.
Being mean to dogs should totally count.
The rest were in a room that was way too full to deal with other than by turning them into ash.
No I mean he was being mean to dogs so his death shouldn't reflect badly on me =P.
Anyway the important thing is I didn't kill the target.
Details are spoilers.
I assumed they would be.
I keep reaching the level end screen and being told I got <50% of available money though =V.
Explore more i guess.
I thought I was!
Think I'm not picking enough pockets.
Turning a bunch of said pockets into ash via crossbow bolt probably doesn't help.
Probably not no.
I blame that asshole trickster whale god.
He is a bit those things yeah.
I found him in the second level and he was all I wonder if you're going to kill or save this target... everyone's going to think they're dead regardless of course.
Stupid god with his meta-awareness.
Punch him in his smug god face.
Idk if any of my continued complaints about The Outsider went through there.
They did not.
Last you said was 133043 Stupid god with his meta-awareness.
I should complete Dishonoured dunno why I stopped.
He keeps teleporting around now.
Just as punctuation.
Every sentence has to be delivered from a different side of me rather than him just float there.
What an ass.
You can at least just say no to his magic this game.
Dunno what that does to all the bone charms and shrines.
Probably just makes them do nothing.
With that shenaniganery I hope the surround sound is good in the game.
The more power you have the bigger an asshole you become. See Wizards.
I should actually check tonight if I can do some bonewitchery.
Idr how many runes it uses.
But in this game Emily at least can become a bone witch and make her own charms.
You pick up whale bones here and there.
And can learn to carve them.
!note MairBear in case you haven't seen.
Always be prepared for clearance.
The clearancest clearance.
Unless they have access to Warnock spells atm?
The don't outside of some very circuirus routes.
I wasn't sure if Gadgetzan.
Because that grouped the cloth classes together for some stuff iirc.
They did but iirc there is no discover a completly open spell for that group.
Thats in the jade lotus cards.
Cooked_Auto I just realised.
>twin-linked is now just two of the weapon.
>Vulture Gunship can have twin-linked punisher cannon.
>hold on while I roll 40 dice.
I remember one of those moments.
A division of Guard conscripts charging.
Entire room had to surrender their dice and someone's hat had to be borrowed.
Man it's a shame World of Tanks is pay2win bullshit.
Welcome to F2P games they need to get money and incentives to spend money somehow. There's always War Thunder otherwise p.
Isn't war thunder just planes?
They added tanks like a year ago or something.
Less arcadey than WoT though.
Working on adding boats now from what Im aware.
Cooked_Auto eh they have two modes.
Arcade mode is very arcade.
Simulation mode is well.
Stormblood hud and skill demos live in the producer's letter.
Red Mage coming up now.
MoonWolf I know but WT Tanks still plays a lot different from WoT because the have locational damage and such.
I have play WT before.
Whats is up with my dinner tonight.
I have no idea what I am tasting out of the ingredients.
I mean its good but confusing.
What even is it ?
Err. some kind of pasta. Made a gravy out of mushrooms onions and bacon then seasoned it with a dash of mirin a bit of rice vinegar some parmesan and oregano.
And then mixed that with pasta.
Sounds good to me.
And thats samurai jack finished. Season started out strong and turned kind of meh by the end.
Tch only get like 2 wins in 7 rounds in an OW session.
A 76 potg with 4 kills but 1 short of the tac vis achi.
But according to blizz it's all made even by a double legendary loot box.
You'd think GOTY 2016 would figure out these wankers were on red against you last game and they won let's put you against them again isn't legit matchmaking.
Looks like a new Runaways series is on the way.
Nico you look very cool but I'm not sure you're still a teen.
Also where did you even get that outfit.
It's just a fishnet top over a swimsuit with...
Ok I have no idea what the skirt.
But it's not *too* out there.
A pentagon swimsuit.
The catbus makes meowing sounds.
We're driving our cat through trainstation hell.
Tonight my *Friend has unknowingly been sending me PreCure smut -_-.
Did they not know it was smut ?
Or that it as you ?
That it was PreCure.
Or even what PreCure was.
Just hey look at these anime lesbians I found.
I believe we're supposed to call it Glitter Force.
Also very lud of that friend to do so.
Takemi why do you need to draw enough blood to cause mild anemia.
The fuck are you planning to do with thta much blood.
I got to inform my *friend of who Steve Blum's respective characters are in Gurren Lagann and Cowboy Bebop.
A good night's work.
!note Noelor don't forget his best role The Big O!
Anathema Releasedate for 8th out June 17th. Preorders on the 3rd.
Are those new assault marine models in the box?
Primaris Marines versus Death Guard.
As the rumors said.
Omg the poxwalker in a lab coat is amazing.
Lord of Contagion is nice too.
Yeah I saw.
Goddamn those jumppacks.
The little shields on the bolters look dumb.
A bit I guess.
I win at weather mine is 61 instead of 60.
Anathema I haven't seen that.
Noelor don't you ellipsis me.
And no idea if they have.
But I'm guessing it's just his Spike voice?
Yeah but with better dialogue like Some people like to stand in the rain without an umbrella. That's what it means to be free.
Anathema I don't think Steve Blum did the translation...
Get out of the way usagi you're blocking the luna pillow.
Noelor it's his completely-serious delivery of it I like.
Also you know yelling about giant robots.
How did you even get in there.
There are better ways to get a Sailor V doll.
Yeah just moon prism beam the glass.
...I sometimes wonder if Mina gets anything out of her merchandise.
Take them all.
Probably not a'the curse of a secret identity.
I'm going to headcannon that Artemis part times as her agent and it goes intro a trust fund.
Given the technical prowess shown by those cats 100% agreed.
Yeah tbf if Sailor Moon ever got merchandise Luna would be all over that.
And not let Usagi see a penny of it.
But just be like don't worry about paying for college.
Which is a good idea because it'd be gone before you finished telling usagi not to spend it all on something dumb.
And you know Usagi wouldn't even question it.
Of course Luna can pay for her to go to college she's a moon princess.
In fact she'd manage to spend it all on something dumb that was also a plot by the badguy of the week.
Luna good news I invested that money you gave me in buying tarot cards.
Oh nooo the tarot cards are evil!!!
Sakura shows up seals her deck of cards. Disapears again.
Its as card capture sakura joke.
I still haven't seen that but yes.
That show also had lesbians right?
It had hella subtext.
She also has a straight love interest in lee though.
>That Genji sentai skin.
That 20s D.Va.
With two separate scarves *and* headphones.
And Hoody Tracer.
Oh god beekeeper mei.
>Reaper does not dance.
Mei dances the fucking haruhi hopening.
Cooked_Auto that's his ult.
More or less.
Jeph wearing a Hanzo tee in the dev update.
He is dead to me now.
Gotta rep the new merchandise man.
Well if its hanzo merchandise is bad merchandise.
Even Hanson mains have money MoonWolf.
...Also Hanzo mains.
Unsure what game Hanson is playable in.
Sc 2 has a scientist named Hanson as a last name.
Doesnt she get turned into a Zerg hybrid in one story path? =p.
Alright the new event is pretty busted.
Not enough ppl were playing our broken deathmatch mode.
We readjusted its ruleset so now the first win lootbox is reset.
The ruleset is as broken as before!
I don't want to play a one on one duel with someone blizzard.
Your game isn't meant for that.
The 3v3 best of 5 where the winning team gets locked out of heroes they won with leaving it a frustrating tie at 2 rounds due to wider pool.
And the 1v1 best of 9 gives you a choice of 3 shared by your opponent leaving it down to a mirrow.
And because red team they win it.
Well the mode is full two kinds of people.
People who are good at it and people who are trying it or want a chest.
I'm in the latter.
And it seems to be mostly full of the former.
Blizzard and NVidia are running a lottery with gfx cards ad prizes.
GlennCuttlefish MoonWolf ^.
They'renot even 1080's.
I mean the tweet was tag your friend who plays HotS on a toaster.
I mean it can't h urt.
Which is more Glenn than you but w/e.
Gmail will probably filter out the spam they're going to send me for this.
You should see my toaster... doesn't even hit the recommended level for OW.
Man I have been feeling like a total creep lately.
Every time I miss my bus I sit down and just look at people walking by for 30 minutes.
Do you make sure to grin if they make eye contact?
I try to avoid eye contact. Looking at how people move.
Give them this look.
There is suddenly a cat on my desk.
What do I do.
Get a new desk.
That's for the cat now.
Or pray the cat finds yours unsatisfactory.
Well I had to toss it off.. it made the mistake of getting between me and my display.
You've made an enemy for life.
Give them this look <- this igor was much better.
P5 igor is the inferior igor.
Thought horribly murdering personas to fuse them is sort of funny.
MairBear also did nobody explain to the voice actors how to pronounce japanese names.
Because seriously i think there has been one person who got the cadance on takamaki right.
Either they didn't know at all or someone decided to just go eh just do whatever.
That tweet but not a joke tbh.
The thing is that its not even hard to figure out the cadance on those names.
You explain it once and you get it.
Its just a fucking grouping thing. figure it out.
I've seen a lot of bullshit LoS abuse from Dva heroics. but I think that last one tops it off.
Only gets into LoS for the kill cos the payload conveniently nudged it the right amount.
So skill for your 3 kill potg...
Oh boy time to try out one of the 2 heroes I can possibly suck at the most in hots.
Multitasking bullshit ho.
Really spotify? a 634kb zip download for a 812kb installer? such savings.
Man that was silly.
My team was stuck in a polymorph loop for like a minute there.
So I finally watched the ffxiv job video MairBear.
And I saw the black mage gauge.
10/10 do not understand anything that is going on in that gauge.
Fresh spreadsheet needed.
Black mage guage ?
All the classes have different gauges it seems.
Well most of them have guages the whitemage has flowers instead.
Astrologian looks the most complicated.
Might just be over design though.
Also wait what.
I might have to resub for this mair.
I just noticed this thing black mages apparently get.
Teleports black mage back to their leylines.
Also the black mage...gauge?
Oh goddamnit the overwatch event is starting isn't it.
Top left seems to track ice / fire buff status counter seems to track lightning dot. no clue what the bottom left does.
Bottom right is probably enochian ?
This would be easier if i knew more about blackmage.
Going to go find wtf whitemages flowers are about now.
MairBear damn it looks like they made the dragoon rotation ever more complicated.
And you can turn your dragons red now.
Whatever that means.
Ninja has somehow gotten even more naruto.
And you can turn your dragons red now <- AOE incoming MOVE.
Anathema i did the nerdiest thing for the discord channel and made the icon spell out OCD O Che De in oldrealm.
Glenn.
Haven't seen some of those before. Thanks.
Oh no I forgot to order coffee again.
Anathema how will you survive?
I got coffee from the geographer today will have to do so again tomorrow I guess.
We were supposed to sign up for this special coffee delivery thing that had a special promotion but forgot.
I remembered to order it ground this time.
Anathema the game is tonight right?
I put it in my calendar just wanted to confirm.
Need to discuss we are gonna swap the dates or go back to original schedule tonight.
If we go back to the original there will be no game on the 14th June.
Those expressions.
Westminster Abbey has recently appointed Reverend Anthony Ball. The seniority of his role means he will be referred to as Canon Ball. snerk.
Hopefully not shit.
Yeah I mentioned that to you a couple of months ago.
I think 'explicitly based on 1st / 2nd edition' is new info/.
Yeah I only mentioned the partnership back then.
Mostly because there was fuck all info other than C7 taking over the publishing of the books online.
Apparently hanzo is bad at japanese.
Don't make fun of it.
Dps tanky is trialling the new lucio skin the track shifting makes it... interesting.
Well the kick-in of one is high pitch trumpet trilling then the other is the sound of a faceroll down a piano.
The track sound level may be a tad overtuned.
But when the shift is frequent it is noticeable.
MoonWolf astonishing.
MairBear i did not see ann's outfit for the second think with the painter coming.
Did not see that comign AT ALL.
DLC costume when.
MairBear Ann's seducing people voice is the DUMBEST THING.
Her Acting voice.
Ah yes Acting.
I've seen really bad porn with better acting.
REALLY bad porn.
Was a good time though!
That was meant to be a question not a statement.
Too late now.
Also this brawl.
I cba'd converting it back to a normal youtube link.
MairBear LP'er got to the bossfight where you get Fox as a party member. Gets to take one action with Fox. Boss takes an action oneshots protagonist.
Few things I hate more in HS than losing a game mostly due to failure to draw X early then see it in your opening mulligan next game.
Certainly is an SMT game up in there MoonWolf.
I assume playing on Hard or Merciless.
BwaS or needing that one card to win.
And then its in your opening hand next game.
What good is malygos now HS.
I needed that 3 turns ago in the previous match.
The real fun is knowing you put a card in your deck.
And not seeing it for 5 games.
And losing because you never drew it in at least half of them.
I have that with shit like Brann in my Jade deck.
I see my one-ofs of stuff like feral rage raven idol more often.
But yeh this week's brawl build a deck of basics and classic commons/rares.
I won my first.
I'll probably not touch it again.
Go for ramp druid only see wild growths when at 10 an innervate out boulderfist just loses on board just my luck.
Was control Warrior vs Druid the most dull as shit thing I've seen in years. Both of us pretty much playing with empty hands.
Throw mark of the wild shattered sun in to assist w/ tempo only see them in hand with no partner to go on.
BwaS oh its standard pauper ?
Well no expansions.
That'll be REALLY boring then.
I KNOW RIGHT.
Basic and Classic only yeah.
So I guess vanilla pauper?
Minus azure drake P.
WIth balance changes from later patches.
I sure enjoy running my 4/5 into you 3/6.
So Tazdingo and the tauren paladin and yeti are go to midgame cards.
When the highest impact you can have is argent commander sunwalker gadgetzan violet teacher. Yeah.
Don't forget 6/7 Ogre 7/7 golem and Stormwind champion!!
I pretty much won on the back of raging worgen having forced him to use removal on questing adventurers.
MairBear lol revival beads are just philemon deciding that nope you're not done yet.
The 100% strength ones are Seriously cut that out have a butterfly.
MairBear suddenly coffee trivia.
It's also just a fairly fun game.
The castlevania animation looks surprisingly decent.
Specially considering its made by frederator studio that makes adventure time.
MoonWolf.
What the shit xD Disguised Toast is singing out of the blue one of the songs from the Sweeney Todd musical.
Decided to honour the spirit of the brawl.
Made a face hunter deck.
Won my first match.
You want peoples faces?
A hunter deck that just does hero damage.
Doesn't really care about board control or other fancy things like that.
GlennCuttlefish gwent is in open beta now btw.
If you ever wnated to play a lot of gwent.
Oo. might check it out.
Also what the fuck is up with this gamemode.
This gamemode ?
At some point their entire team got tired of my shit.
Everyone is chasing mercy.
Including their mercy.
Glenn i can't see your screen i have no clue what arcade game you are playing.
Which is ridiculous since our lucio is on the point.
Its a mdoe in overwatch.
You know the one where everything charges instantly.
In the end our genji had 62000 damage done.
Hadn't tried that one yet.
Our lucio had 124 sound barriers.
Just played 3 game of mystery heroes last night for easy boxes.
Its a fun mode but dont expect to win if you are attacking.
Yeah i can see that.
Like lucio can boost every 3 seconds.
Winston can jump and put down shields around every 2 seconds.
Heroes literally never die.
There is a seemingly infinite amount of zarya bubbles all the time.
Although i suppose a sombra can keep an team locked down forever.
And yes heroes get revived more often than marvel heroes.
Good luck hacking anything through that ocean of shields.
Gdoens't emp shut shields down ?
Err. not sure if it shuts down all shields.
Guess it does.
Speak of the devil v.
It's me the actual devil.
That's a very silly cosplay.
Know what were cool?
The aspect symbols for the alchemical exalted.
Know what I cannot find pictures of at all on Google?
The aspect symbols for the alchemical exalted.
I have them somewhere.
Sorry i lied.
Tbf I ended up googling something more generic but rights-free anyway.
Those are the only ones i DON'T HAVE.
MoonWolf internet is same.
Not just gay people.
Pretty sure plenty of that is drawn by staight people.
Oh good.
Just waht we needed.
A purple/pink viper with heart camo.
Also it mind controls units.
Because love is basically mind control.
400 per month.
Fix your damn website so its not literally satan to scroll it.
So it's not just me then? Good.
But i can't read half of these.
More annoyed that the Reinhardt one is incorrect.
It's out btw.
NieR 1 streaming I think I'm the only audience rn?
I missed the start of that due to not being in my room.
Well Argate wasn't audible anyway and they're just fishing for a bit.
So Magic Schoolbus is getting a reboot.
Noelor i forget is this your first time with Nier 1 or did you read/watch and lp before ?
Then i will shut up about stuff.
I am very confused and somewhat upset.
You should be.
Although you are letting Yoko Taro win.
Well I'm now going to go out and drink cocktails.
Enjoy your drunk.
I'll have one for Kanye I guess.
He sure is a good storyteller.
Let's use those words.
So I nuked my PC with compressed air y'day evening.
Overwatch now runs about 20 degrees cooler.
I should buy more compressed air myself.
Temperatures have been going up again lately.
Altho that might be due to summer approaching I guess.
Same even if the extra fan I put in a while ago has helped a lot.
So I nuked my PC with compressed air y'day evening logged in 50 minutes 30 second <- i should probably do this too.
I know I went over it with a sputtering can when I installed the fan.
The heck is an Azure Blob in the context of I think AzureDB.
Cloud storage from microsoft blob storage is for storing random files images documents etc.
That's p dumb.
Not really blob is a known term.
Blob or binary blobs are just how databases store data they don't know anything about.
Its just a chunk of data that they do nothing with just a whole giant chunk of nonsense binary for them.
As opposed to a string or a date.
Databases can Do stuff with those.
You can subtring images in sql server! you get back in hex format though.
Ok so it's like it's untyped.
So far as DB stuff is concerned.
Yeah you can't do much in the db itself.
We're setting up Flow at work.
And there are some triggers based on blobs being added.
Explains the metadata only caveat there as well actually.
!note Noelor.
Guess this means half the Ravnica party are switches. Good to know I guess vOv.
As a Wizard everyone else is your bitch until you come across a stronger wizard.
Paladins bottom? Some people are paladining wrong.
GlennCuttlefish argue with the twitter user.
See that would require me to post on twitter.
Well i looked at twitter for you and the artist had the following things to say about paladins.
I only play paladins and my chart is infallible.
My Ravnica group also had things to say about chart such as scoffing at the Warlock position.
Oh boy the start of a new game in anime hell tonight MoonWolf!
What 2 is already finisheduploading ?
No on the stream.
DDD starts actual tonight.
Though I fell asleep watching 2 on youtube because it's too warm.
And when I woke up they were talking about horse semen.
I thought we we're not doing anime hell this week.
And there is the twitch stream popup.
And I don't think I want to rewind to work out how Mulanworld contextualises that.
Twitter clients are OP.
...I found out earlier than twitch because I'm in Fae's patreon discord P.
Yeah well i don't have money to patreon with.
I know but you seemed to be blaming twitter.
Which was incorrect.
The returning of the mating call of the sombra.
Skooma is ahell of a drug.
Is anyone else watching Burger Chip's Lettuce Play of Overcooked!?
I swear the punctuation is correct in that sentence I had to be very careful.
Also waht ?
Well this is a game.
Anathema So apparently there is a Blood Ravens Chapter Master model coming out from FW in a month or two D.
So yeah its pretty much DoW3 Angelos.
Well the rumours were true aria is a really good series.
If you are into the whole comfy but nothing happens thing.
GlennCuttlefish does that mean....? Dc.
Oh neat that site has Hetalia too I need to actually watch more than the first 2 eps of that.
Mair not yet.
I still have half of season 2 an OVA and season 3 to watch D.
Savour having fun >C.
Anyone feel like doing a couple of VS ai hots games.
Anyone else moonwolf anathema ?
In pursuit of artI have had to do even more disgusting thing than oogling at people.
I had to...install quicktime.
GlennCuttlefish for... art ?
Toonboom requires some quicktime libraries it turns out.
This website won't load on my phone so I'm hoping PatternSpider can at least tell me the title we've just spent the past solid 10 minutes screaming about this character's name.
Dammit I can't even copy links properly.
...I think worth it.
That is a not a lore friendly miqo'te name.
Might almost fit on a roegadyn.
As an example of just how stupid 40k 7th got the last ever game of 7th to be broadast on the GW twitch channel is starting soon and the only models involed are jetbikes with scatter lasers and a wraithknight.
At least there IS a wraithknight ?
Yeeaaaah welcome to Eldar. They are kinda ridiculous.
Only one p.
Yeah but they still look cool.
Cooked_Auto that dreadnought should not of skipped leg day.
Dreadnought legs being sort of skinny has always been part of their weird design.
But they keep bulking the top and not upgrading the legs.
So its getting a little out of hand.
A lot of the FW dreads has proper legs.
Ok there is a lot of psykers here too one of the guys has 20 dice this psychic phase o_0.
A whole bunch of psykers that are all invisible and they have scatter lasers.
This is a little silly.
And not in the way warhammer 40k is upposed to be silly.
MoonWolf are you watching it?
Stopped becuase its sto damn slow.
Hah thee seer councils are in combat now that fight is gonna take a while.
Anathema So the 40k FB message about that stream amazingly cheeky.
It's the end of an era of on Warhammer Live today our last ever game of the current edition of Warhammer 40000 is being streamed direct from Warhammer Fest.
We thought we would send it off in true 7th Edition style we have an army of Eldar Wind Rider Jetbikes up against... an army of Eldar Wind Rider Jetbikes AND a Wraithknight!
I'm glad your team footballed well btw.
I presume he refers to Celtic beating Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup final y'day.
So I had that time one year where I watched nascar because fucking dogecoin.
And now I'm watching the fucking indy 500 because fucking fernando alonso S.
Okay screw this they only got 8 laps in before they needed a 5 lap long ad break.
I'd rather rewatch a VOD of the flipping Russian GP snorefests.
Does anything even really happen from round to round ?
Round to round of what?
There is a follow up buuuuuuuut its not exactly worksafe.
Cooked_Auto hit me with it I'm terrified.
It's not that terrifying just not really worksafe.
Oh! Well then!
Quick name an animal.
I'll do penguin first since less legs.
Aww yisss LWA game.
Cant comment more since there was about 0.5 seconds of gameplay there.
Also booo? you are the one who called for penguins mair.
Yeah but you skipped quagga.
Become one with your stacks.
Powerpuff 2016 not great actually.
Havent heard anything positive about it.
Powerpuff XXXX not great actually P.
Anathema Holeeee shieeeet.
This might have piqued my interest because factional bias but I love these narrative football manager runs.
Like a eugenics-inspired dictator I strip my team of ethnic diversity to mould the current squad into a homogenous tartan army.
This guy is enjoying writing about that far to much.
Well Attack on Tighten this week was an entire episode worth of dialogue that advanced or revealed literally nothing.
Must have ran out of animation budget.
I watched all of my hero acadamy over the weekend.
That was pretty good.
Wish the actual plot moved a bit faster though.
Might just read the manga instead.
The latest series I have been watching pretty much nothing has happened for 1½ seasons now.
What game of thrones ?
I thought that was the point of it ?
Huh outsider updated again.
Well its a new year.
So thats about on schedule.
Mulanworld is real hard to watch.
The Eddie Murphy dragon gets his charge kicked out of the army via deadnaming.
Noelor pretty much.
It gets a whole lot darker when you start adding trans themes in general.
Sora Donald and Goofy do not improve matters.
They rarely do.
In fact the whole series would be much better if sora donald and goofy just did not feature in it.
We could make literally anyone else the protagonist.
And it'd be better.
I propose an alternate version of anime hell 1 where malificent is the protagonist.
MairBear 1635.
Well I was planning on making burgers anyway.
Anyone fancy 80 mutual HS friendship gold?
I destroyed BwaS with murlocs and enjoyed every moment.
9/10 would duel for gold again.
Two warleaders and finishers in first 10 cards vs paladin not having consecrate by turn 4.
Shoul dhave just drawn good.
Alternativly heart of the cards ?
My deck tracker app didn't load for some reason.
Maybe that was why.
Dammit MoonWolf I'm up to the BeautyBeastLand videos and now I want soup.
Are you currently angry at me for having soup weeks ago.
Is this whats happening right now ?
It was really nice soup.
I've ordered curry instead because I hadn't realised how late it was.
Tell them you want more garlic with it.
<- roborosewater writes mark rosewater articles.
MoonWolf do you follow either Dan's or the EGS account on twitter?
Should have just told them you'd do it for money dan.
Even Dan Shive will not draw pseudo-incest for money.
We don't know if its incest yet.
It might not be.
Hm unsure whether to do Y-hw-h or some sort of Fire Boss for tomorrow's final Panic.
I'm a big fan of fire everywhere.
Yeah it's probably more interesting too.
Or you could have yahweh plus his sidekick the morning star.
Given one of the PCs is already in the throw everything everywhere now the floor is gone wheelhouse.
...I'm so glad Fae felt the need to tell us Emma Watson's a furry.
Facts with fae.
Bop it! Twist it! etc.
Please do not twist it.
Remember not to squeeze.
Why the shit is Auron in Hades.
That was my reaction.
He's in completly the wrong afterlife.
And its never xplained as far as i remember.
Unless all the Worlds share afterlives.
Yeah it seems to just be.
In which case HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT WORK.
Except of all the games.
FFX actually has a pretty definitely defined afterlife iirc?
Sort of ?
Some ingame people argue the Farplane is not actually an afterlife.
Its just uses pyreflies to show you people you remember.
It may or may not be the Lifestream.
Going with afterlives are real here it has a very definite one.
And auron did get sent in the end.
From what I know that's basically canon.
I mean its not like the Abridged series would be lying about Goku being a shitty dad.
I'm so sad you can't be female protagonists in Persona Q.
Going to assign that fact some of the blame for the fact I haven't played much of it.
Who knows what they'll do for the inevitable re-release in a year or so.
Hopefully not adding another archbitch like they did in Golden.
Does she expect a bunch of lads from Hull to pile in Neil's Nissan Micra with their pitbulls and a few cans of fosters at four in the morning drive to some field somewhere and chase some foxes around in the bushes? Because that's as close as most of us are getting to fox hunting.

Gues it blew up.
Seems like it.
Had no idea Smurf was writing for EG now P.
A file was taking a long time to load so I checked Task Manager.
I have a process running a few times called Microsoft.Mashup.Container.
Which doubtless sounds cooler than it is.
I don't actually know what those do.
Cooked_Auto omg I never followed up on thay.
Mfw I read 30k Ultramarine rules and think these are actually pretty cool >.<.
Well the question was what they were doing at the time.
But you can tell it's a good bug report because they don't just say a taco they're specific about it.
That's being a responsible software user.
Finally some rain.
Now lets see if the promised thunder will show up later.
BwaS FYI I'll be starting a new game at the fortnightly RPG from the 13th looking for new players if you're interested.
It'll be Fellowship which Mair and MoonWolf can attest to the goodness of.
SPEAKING OF RPGS.
Dungeon World is tomorrow.
Colleague and I both tried to scrape this website so they could properly compare who's on when in their own time.
Found out it's awful.
Either over 300 tables one for each day for each stage.
Or a just a loooong list of lines.
Still kinda eerie.
I really wanna watch AG.
How far through is it?
Ive heard its a doozy.
Seems worth waiting for it to finish for binging at this point.
5 out of 7 by the looks of it.
Final episode airs on June 18.
It'll be Fellowship which Mair and MoonWolf can attest to the goodness of <- considred it attested.
The infinity symbol must be in Unicode right?
Its got it as part of math symbols so it also has a few infinity symbols variants.
Like incomplete infinity ⧜.
I cannot find it on my keyboards.
Here is regular ∞.
This has been instrumental in a dumb argument.
Glad to be of assistance.
Urgh in the recent mini-book for Ex3 the developer on it some WoD guy already broke the Eclipse keyword there's a charm that turns your Withering damage into motes...
That is ridiculously broken.
What is it scenelong? suplemental ?
Hm. this new hamburger sauce recipe turned out okay but it needs some refining. Its decent now but I am sure I can improve on it.
What is it ?
There's a duo q I'm with right now.
Both their battletags are 'depression'.
The puns are kinda sweet.
Well spotted CA.
MoonWolf per attack but works with brawl charms IIRC.
Still can make charmed withering attacks basically free.
The attack does no damage what it would have done is taken as motes instead but it's still fucking stupid and breaks the mote economy and makes Eclipses just straight up better.
I got into work early today ie before 9.
And it's messing up my rhythm I feel like I should be breaking for lunch already -.
Damn human bodies.
When do we get upload already.
Noelor PLZ NO.
Also slight drizzle.
From the best week to the worst week weather wise v.
I'll believe it.
Also sorry MoonWolf.
It's my entire Twitter feed this morning.
It was in my scrollback.
Except for like one tweet by anathema complaining about software and one from Clove celebrating FFXIV.
Luckily my entire feed wasn't swallowed by it just a couple of them.
And then once or twice on my other one so hooray for that P.
It's my entire Twitter feed this morning <- thats why i wanted to get away from it.
Anathema jfc that cloak.
That is some sick freehand.
Today in things Noelor's unreasonably annoyed by posts on business' yammer page congratulating winners of a women in construction award with the message well done girls!
Anathema Full 8th ed leak if you're really curious.
Cooked_Auto does that have the indexes for armies or just the core rules?
Seems like a bitch to load though.
Well I have to work now and run a game tonight.
PatternSpider> do you understand norwegian? danish? finnish? icelandic?
PatternSpider does not.
Omfg there's a Fix Bayonets order just like I wanted <3.
In the grim dark spacefuture.
We still have bayonets.
But also because the bayonets can be chainsaws.
Not sure why you wouldn't just keep the chainsaw seperate.
No need to also attach it to the end of your gun.
More efficient hand use innit?
Sure yes. Good point.
Small blade + gun = spear and spears are better than knives when fighting orks.
Dont think I've actually seen any chainsaw bayonets. There are bolters with serrated combat blades but not chainsword ones.
Noelor one day i'm going to do something terrible to you.
Oh oopsy me that wasn't MairBear I tabbed to.
What a mistake to make.
Anathema GlennCuttlefish see above link.
Quite the mistake.
That's an angry emoji.
Yes that is the name of the emoji.
Why so anger.
I'm not sure.
I just felt like using that emoji.
It might just be nothing at all.
An emoji so angry it appeared as a 4-stud lego brick.
Upgrade your font friend.
Those are lethal as we all know.
Well granted all I kept seeing was a square vOv.
Upgrade your font friend.
Anathema health benefits of running a mile a day for a month?
Twelve marathons a year are you mad.
Noelor better heart etc although you're better doing 3 miles every 3 days if you can.
If you're not already at that level though start gently.
But the 3 miles every 3 days is better than 1 every day since you will be putting more strain on your cardiovascular system even if the time spent / distance covered is exactly the same + have time to recover.
Anathema yeah that makes sense.
And idk what they actually did.
But someone I follow did the equivalent of >1 marathon over the entirety of May.
I'm looking forward to being able to run again in ~2 weeks.
That situation where adding 'please' to something makes it sound ruder than excluding it because of Britain.
You did this to yourself as a culture.
I think one of our testers just got a delivery of flowers + balloon that says I love you o_0.
Good for them testers are people too.
Yeah but delivered to where they work?
Lady who used to work in my office got such a delivery once.
Think it was her birthday?
S'cute very grandly romantic.
Only do it for someone you're actually already in a relationship though.
And only if you know they'll actually appreciate a flowers b the attention.
Well ofc they put FMA in there...
It is after all an anime with a mum with that hair to whom bad things happen.
The worst things.
Just got MVP as Xul.
I think my second ever game as him.
I love Heroes Brawl.
All the funsies that goes on when ppl go in with QM mindset and results orientated thinking.
Yes let's contest obj 3v5 on map down a talent tier.
I play a 0 death li-ming game get 20 killstreak by end meanwhile there's a blue jaina on 10 deaths by end.
The matchmaking that pairs us up I do not know.
We need to contest boss we need to contest boss.
We're up in levels we still have fort in that lane let's push other lanes at keep and even core oh look we won.
But i like killing the boss BwaS.
This almost makes me not wish for the ability to just sell overwatch out of my collection.
Cooked_Auto that is certainly David Lynch.
Huh! Apparently Rolf Harris has been aquitted? That actually makes me happy!
Acquitted of latest historical allegations but still had earlier conviction.
I dont suppose anyone here could stream latest twin peaks season for me.
So the changed SWL combat system is starting to look interesting even the pistols feature *annoys* me.
These guys are streaming Hearts of Iron if anyone's into that.
MairBear it turns out.
It could be helped.
Hogs getting nerfed again.
Apparently they are dropping his damage enough not to oneshot everything with hookshot.
Also MairBear MoonWolf wanna join me and noelor in hots?
It's patching at me >C.
Noelor's still brbing so you can do it!
Also get on mumble MairBear.
Went into tavern brawl randomonium.
Had the usual hyper aggro opponent going all face because no taunts up.
Stabilise with anomalus. concede happens when I drop kazakus.
Why am I always the one playing the control side...
Would that I could help you explain.
Mmmmmaybe spoilers?
<- i love birb of justice she's my favourite.
MoonWolf are you not tempted to try it yet? p.
Morrowind is a game that has aged terribly and a activly dispise a number of its mechanics.
Why would i want to play that but also a roguelike.
That does sound kinda abhorrent.
You're all dead to me.
Fine with that.
I mean they're utena characters they are gas ass by default.
Well they could have not delivered.
So nice of the weather to be less british today.
U wot m8?
It's really nice here just now.
Yes niow. But what about later? Then you might be back to grey and dreary.
A better comeback would be yeah but Cambridge has a bizarre micro-climate the rest of the country is shit.
How the fuck would you expect me to know that? p.
Due diligence when shitposting p.
And I bet it still hasnt got maid dressup features.
Anathema The old 8th ed leaks got pulled down to here's them as PDFs.
Eh not too bothered.
Discovered a reliable weird trick last game If you are ever in a crowded place and it looks like shit you can't handle is about to go down just start yelling KHORNE into the air until help arrives.
Suddenly deamon princes ?
So I worked out why I didn't come back to FFXIV the last time I was considering it.
SquareEnix account management is awful.
It seems that I have two accounts one I can't get into because I don't have the authenticator installed and don't remember the password.
And one that it won't allow to be linked to FFXIV.
Noelor thats a bit horrible.
Also hbomberguy to 90 minutes to really really get into why he hates the bbc's sherlock series.
A lot more effort than it ever deserved.
MoonWolf oh has he released?
When I grabbed that screenshot last night of stupid metrics it was still under copyright lockdown.
He did some stuff with horrible recolouring of some of the show footage.
Anathema I'm now confirmed as a zombie for Urban Nightmare btw.
S1 was good then it disappeared up its own anus like just about everything Moffat writes.
Enjoy being a zombie.
Or all of the zombies ?
Some of the zombies ?
I'm not sure.
But enjoy it anyway.
Possibly a standin for all zombies.
Maybe some sort of necromancer?
Just a head thats a zombie ?
Like uh the boyfriend from Lollip Chainsaw.
Noelor from the description on the cambridge one zombiemeisters are not actual people but inject unpredictibility into how the zombies act and stuff. Like an AI Director in Left3Dead.
Oh god so much of my chest hurts.
You know how you can feel your sternum really easily? there's still very thin muscle there.
Nigel Farage is 'person of interest' in FBI investigation into Trump and Russia ofmg.
If this uncovers some sort of dumb farage russia corruption thing.
I'm going to laugh.
Unfortunatly he isn't suspected of anything just now they just think he has information they need.
Anathema they're coming to take him away ha haa he hee ho hoo?
Mfw I remember my MP once said.
'she jokingly described Oliver Cromwell's sale of Scots into colonial slavery as an answer to the West Lothian question... '.
You're MP seems like an ass.
Oh ffs outlook just wont load in firefox anymore.
What a trash browser.
It was working the browser froze so I restarted it.
I've had increasing problems with firefox.
Weird loads fine for me.
I cna't figure out how to clear the cache.
Even if I had an odd security issue a couple of days ago but that must've been their side for it.
Why does everyone keep ruining UX.
Anathema i blame phones/tablets.
Ive learned from experience you practically need to hammer the clear now button in FF if you want to completely empty the cache because it has overflow.
Fuck you adoring fan.
Fuck you so much.
Incidentally prophecy guard means that if you draw this card due to hitting a specific health breakpoint it'll have HS style Taunt.
I'm not sure if that persists through its last gasp but i think it will.
So tahts fucking infuriating combined with the silence immunity.
Youtube working fine for everyone else?
For some reason all my playlists and subscriptions are gone.
Odd. working now.
Mine are there.
Season when I can just sit on the veranda watching my arctic shoggoth holograms in the pleasant...
6 degree weather.
Whats the difference between an arctic shoggoth and a regular one ?
Cover for new Runaways.
Who the hell are the two people in the centre ?
MairBear HS patch is here now we can finally quest against friends and copy/paste decks.
And not have your list look silly that one arc int is in golden while the other isn't.
AAEBAf0EAsAB7AUOccMBuwKVA5YFuQbJDfcNiQ7BtALXtgLrugKHvQLBwQIA <- behold a hearthstone deck.
Egh needs grand crusader to roll for none of your business to accelerate it.
Also put me 4 short.
Egh needs grand crusader to roll for none of your business to accelerate it <- sure sounds like a great plan.
Lemme just make room for that once in every 200 games combo.
That's the spirit!
All you need is that 1 in 200 get your trolden appearance and the deck serves its purpose!
Right now its purpose is winning wild games.
Its pretty good at that.
That's not a word...
MairBear it is now!
MoonWolf you must be right. I think it's a synonym for slow as f.
Pretty great.
!note noelor.
I understand that pain mair.
It's the 4th panel that sells it for me.
But here have a happy wolf.
Clear my ass british dreary skies.
!note MairBear deathwing got an upgrade.
I don't think thats very in character for mercy.
So she likes to unwind with some box wine after a hard day healing idiots.
Except box wine ice cubes silly straws she's a bit too classy for that.
Should have been tracer instead.
Tracer would totally drink boxed wine with icecubes and a silly straw.
I'd say sombra but i don't think she'd even drink wine.
I could see her with icecubes and straw.
Anathema the Vraks Pt 2 book I won earlier this week arrived today in the mail.
How on earth I am going to fit in the 7th ed rulebook now thats its available a lot cheaper I have no idea. Same goes with any 8th ed books because I am going to buy at least the new IG codex when it comes out.
Going to have to sacrifice some older codexes.
Sacrifice them to Tzeentch presumably.
Pages for the paper throne.
My poor wallet.
Its a bigger more special tanks for the bigger more special space marines.
The turrent looks stupid.
The turret looks a bit overgribbled thats the problem.
Also the tank is ultramarine but the marine is red ?
Techmarines are red.
Nice to see the Chapter Approved books making a return.
Is that a fucking SM grav tank.
But its only for super special marines.
Not just regular ones.
Well they added those centurions and the dreadknight only the natural progression.
Both those models are awful.
I grabbed a Dreadknight and a pair of GK termies at half off from a store that was clearing out their inventory. Planning to do some conversion work on the babycarrier at least.
Possibly slap a FW Knight head on it.
9c...Ehh. Guess I will survive watching anime out there with the help of coffee and freshly baked apple pie.
Started to rain now though.
What FFXIV world should I roll on?
...I'm hitting random appearance on a catlady.
And it gave me a Vivec face?
Guess the choice has been made then.
Noelor i'd take it.
Also i forgot what world we were on.
I ended up going with freckles instead.
Because freckles are cute and apparently incompatible with being Vivec.
Vivec does not freckles its true.
Cunts I'd send to the fucking gulag in siberia warrior players who spend the entire fuse on turn 1 deciding whether or not to play their quest.
Its a hard choice.
Easiest fucking deck in the game and they're too braindead to work out turn 1.
What if they want to coin axe instead.
Think I may have had coin.
Bad enough that it's rank 21 and an unfavoured matchup.
Little fucking communication might help so we can stop wasting time.
My *friend just ordered a pizza with olives *and* pineapple.
Then added sweetcorn and *that* was the thing they think makes them a monster.
Or at least re-educate on the subject of pizza.
I can almost see anchovies and pineapple on the same pizza.
I use pineapple and blue cheese occasionally.
Our family homemade pizza had anchovies for a while when I was younger and I think my parents throw on that occasionally when they make their own type.
So for going 4W 1D 5L in S5 placements I land over 200 MMR adrift of where I ended up end of S4.
Yeah blizz legit just give me the equiv to a 20 game loss streak to start me off.
Saint Jeff's vaunted idea being if you're good and belong where you were you will climb.
NOT IF IT'S FUCKING BRONZE.
Had a match on Lijiang.
MairBear i think Noelorneeded to know what FF14 server to be on.
2-1 up teammate leaves 5v6 we lose the set 3-2. fucking unbelievable.
Behold slightly more accurate weather.
Now lets you know what place it found the weather for instead of parroting what placed your searched the wather for.
So I had it last season the ones who got to Masters division and shit looking for the funsies at the very basement.
Now at the start of this one I get them again.
Only instead of throwing it for blue team to plummet they carry red team /hard/ as they casually climb back to where they were.
Better still Korean with a battletag that looks like it lost a fight with a lawnmower.
Oh shoot. erm hrm I need to decide what I'm doing for servers then huh?
This looks like a good class.
What happened to VERJOLT.
No one knows!
if know what i'm playing when i play this agai.
Dead class?
You got me.
Y u play dead class tho.
I don't know either.
Aaaah I need to do some HS quests aaaah.
But you can do them against friends now!
MoonWolf come give me easy wins!
You don't have to do this thing.
I'm going to just make a trash deck in casual filled with 1-2 manas.
I'm already doing the thing.
One one more season of aria to watch oh noo.
And then half a season of alice to zouroku.
Aand something I am forgetting.
Worry not Mair I should be done with all these once the stars align and we are actually awake at the same time once more.
MairBear> MoonWolf so I got that spectate quest I imagine if I spectate both sides unless you get a weird draw I'll complete it p.
I'm not sure that works but lets find out.
5 more 2 mana or less minions.
Oh is that what you were up to.
I thought it was like quest hunter where you mulliganed it out p.
MoonWolf Yeah saw that one on the SA 40k thread.
MoonWolf either my draws are weird or I have a standard deck that also is about 2 mana minions ...
MairBear what is this deck.
Sometimes I make decks my way.
This is the result.
MairBear I'm only on free trial.
But it'd be nice to know what server you're on.
At present my big deal main is on Faerie which is in the Aether data cluster.
Discord have advised me that if I wanna play with goons which they're goons technically but otherwise ehhhh Ultros or Cactuar.
But with stormblood I might transfer to Hyperion on the Primal cluster.
I wanna say those're both US?
Does just nobody play on EU or what?
Not the people I know D.
Well I wanted to play on EU because lag.
So I rolled a MRD on Shiva this afternoon.
Also I hear things about Cactuar being a super serious hardcore grumpy server >.>'.
Oh or Excalibur actually.
Which does sound rad but also I think US.
I will remind that to be in the same guild and do things in the same region hunts quests etc you have to be on the same server.
But you can do dungeons and raids and so on with anyone on the same data cluster.
I mean I figured.
Apparently nobody cool plays on EU.
Even though that's just the one cluster.
Glenn and his guild did!
But then he came to join me.
At this time it looks like the most likely thing I'll do is transfer to Hyperion with my big deal main and my lesser character who is still 60 and done with MSQ will go back to Faerie.
MoonWolf it's kind of tragic how the biggest difference in our hands. Was that you had the Kirin Tor Mage and I didn't xD.
Otherwise that was nearly a mirror in terms of what I saw you play vs what I was holding x3.
The superior secret mage is mine.
Its a joke because kirin tor mage is a mage and he casts secrets.
My *friend has reacted to MMO talk by logging into their Gaia account.
Noelor but whyyy.
MairBear i ran out of quests so if you still have some.
Go uhm kill pubbies ?
I gave you like ano hour of easy wins.
Okay 45 minute sof wins and 3 games of destroying you with secret mage.
I had never heard of Gaia.
Looked it up thinking is it something like Aion from Korea or something?
Who goes from talking mmo's to logging on to neopets equiv and announce it relevant S.
MoonWolf I killed a pubby cos he misplayed.
A secret mage who had me a 4 hp when I killed him. Because he played antonidas into my mirror image and didn't have the mana to cast any spells.
Anathema 8th ed preorders up.
Nu alarak feels less bursty but is still rather fun. Plus I love the new quests he has.
All of them have a finish this specific thing get the quest insta finished.
!weather Burgum The Netherlands.
!weather Drachten The Netherlands.
The fuck is wrong with my bot.
!weather new york.
New York New York~.
Turns out a lot of things are called new york.
Cooked_Auto> do you want to be a part of it?
State area inside of the state city inside of the area.
I was thinking more of this in this case P.
Abathur solos delivering the payload right?
That makes sense?
Thats a good use of abathur.
Good attention being paid by the 4 other players.
MoonWolf to what degree is Fashion Fantasy XIV a thing?
Its the real endgame.
Ok but how do?
Should I be keeping nice boots just in case?
Okay so you can make gear look like other gear through crafting system created things.
Same for dyes.
If you want to use those boots later yes.
Though you can probably buy them from the auction house equivalent if its low level geaer.
This game is asking me to assign my own stat bonuses.
Put them in your jobs mainstat.
Nothing else matters.
Its a dumb and pointless mechanic.
My class seems to have two main stats.
Its a dumb and pointless mechanic <- why do you hate fun.
And for the sake of asking what about the HP/MP stats?
What are you playing ?
GlennCuttlefish press x next to the button that means be better isn't fun.
Which alleges to take damage from both Str and Vit.
Oh you managed to stumble in a class with some amount of choice.
I'm guessing the bonuses are only applied when you're in the class you picked them for?
Vit makes you marginally more survivable.
Str makes you do more damage and so more agro.
But the total bonus is tiny anyway.
I wanted to start in pirateland and didn't want to be a caster.
You don't get a mechanical advantage for having leveled up every job.
And from what you're saying the other stats do grow but not by as much?
Ad it all gets overshadowed by gear.
Personally i 'd pump str.
I'm thinking 21 Str/Vit based on what you said.
Unless splitting is somehow also dumb.
No thats fine but i'd split 11.
Nah go with 21.
If you die.
Its healers fault.
Always their fault.
Oh woe is me.
Woe this day.
Lost against my friend in fighting games.
Oh thank goodness.
What does the little * number in my gear sets signify?
Having such a love hate relationship with the hunter ungoro legendary.
I'm winning games with this deck but feels too often it's from savannah highmane et al just doing hunter things and not the 1-drop cascade snowball.
Having the main thing of your deck be a delivery system rather than the win condition itself doesn't seem awful?
If you're winning anyway.
Like freeze mage doesn't win by freezing you they win by freezing you long enough to set your face on fire.
I more meant the starting 1-drops to run the quest with to then proc it.
Arranged marriage is the original shipping all those wars about succession and marriage arrangements? Shipping Wars. All those games of CKII? Shipping Simulators.
Noelor where did you end up playing again?
Well this is a depressing amendment.
Editor's note An earlier version of this article stated that Trump was at a golf club in Bedminster NJ. It has been updated to reflect that Trump is at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling VA.
Noelor I do have a level 21 tank on cerberus so if you need assistance with the first 3 dungeons just shout if I'm online~.
The rogues' guild just has... a shirtless catboy.
As that's on the same server pool so I can cross realm.
Just hangin' out.
Noelor you got a problem with shirtless catboys ?
I just don't understand why it's exclusive to the Rogues.
There are more shirtless catboys also other boys.
Well I didn't see anyone shirtless at the arcanists' or marauders' that I remember.
And I'm not allowed to leave Linsa yet.
Well no i don't think there are any other class training spots with shirtless catboys.
Noelor look at them so dainty.
So dictionally devilish!
How are you finding the uhm.
Use of language ?
In this game.
Because its Special.
It's certainly something.
Noelor also all the quest puns ? all english translation stuff.
The innkeeper here in Limsa can sit on a barbed dildo.
The japanese names were not punny.
I think newer content does have similar horrible puns in japanese now though.
So uhm yay.
Also i was not aware of any barbed dildos in this game.
I'm saying I hate his speech pattern.
Rogue seems p good though.
Never actually dabbled in rogue/ninja.
Ninja's get very.. naruto.
Yeah I do a lot of dumb anime spin kicks.
With massive wooshy vfx.
I just wish that as a catgirl I got a third dagger to hold with my tail.
For maximum anime.
It's weird you can't start as one though.
They were not available at the start i believe.
Which is why you can't.
The guild's right there in Linsa.
And you start at level 1 again.
So it feels weird even knowing why.
Similarly ninja requires you to go through the storyline for it to be available at all.
I guess that's part of why they didn't add any more base classes since?
Also so much easier to not have to add all the low level content for them either.
Actually you can now? Maybe a change? level ninja as soon as you're 30 regardless of main story.
Little disappointed there's no sneaking gait animation.
Stop making me want to play this.
I cant afford it.
Were you on the right realm anyway?
No I'm playing on EU.
Reynad on miracle ish priest vs silence priest.
Cabal shadow priest opponent 1/8 northshire.
Goes 'full northshire' with that his 2 natural northshires for 1 heal draw 3 proc.
Goes reddit highlight inc of a wild pyro/circle play.
Nah just dies to potion of madness d spirit d spirit innner fire.
He was right though just not the highlight he expecte.
Mair hey mair.
Lets do the time warp again.
Also how do cats function at all they obviously have no brain.
Sorry it was on my playlist.
Why is mair particularly rocky horror of the lot of us?
MairBear has raided with GlennCuttlefish the most.
I'm also the most fabulously dressed maybe?
I mean in games...
Sure as hell lose that award in real.
In seriousness friend is over ended up listening to rocky horror numbers yet again.
Like anyone needs an excuse to play rocky ost on a saturday night.
Whitemage didn't get very mch love.
But at least they can pull people around.
That is in fact vital.
MairBear i just looked at an actual WHM video.
Lillies are SHIT.
Woo 4/10/20 cooldown reduction on some abilities.
Meanwhile RDM is a dps.
Doing amazing heals and rezzes?
DPS with a side of healer assistance.
Which is a lot more useful than dps with a side of tanking.
Nobody beause thats only ever useful when the tanks fuck up.
But people die all the time.
And healers will enjoy not using mana on raises.
DPS with a side of tanking - Larryzaur is not a good role model for DRK.
Well i was more thinking of Dragoon with that.
Which had all these utterly useless melee tank-ish skills.
And by its very nature redmage was always going to be hybrid.
Rather it hybrid towards something useful.
Rather than emergency maybe don't die tanking while healers try to fix things.
Ah yeah in 1.0 Lancer was sort of an off tank and so was pugilist actually evasion tank.
Evasion tank i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine i'm dead now.
Hrm great. Realize I need to update the firmware on the router set as an AP but can't access it without having to reset everything.
Nvm found the ip address v.
And then I forgot the password for it. Damn it. Gotta reset and redo it.
Already clad in MMORPG clown garb.
Noelor when you go to The Waking Sands make sure you pick up the quest to at least be able to dye your stuff.
Transmog comes at 50 though >.<.
I log in and I'm in the novice network.
First message in chat Never sayd sic that Y'shtola was a waifu ! Just that she was cute.
Y'shtola is PRIME waifu material.
Wont deny that even if Merlwyb is better. 3c But that might be my tall women weakness speaking through there.
AI loss cos it put morales llili probius genji and dehaka vs a good AI team.
Oh and our genji left 3 mins in.
Sounds like genji alright.
!note Mairbear.
Is... is the entire fishing guild dual-specced for alliteration?
Enjoy the worst profession in the game!
Well it wasn't the worst in nier.
Maybe if reeling in any fish didn't take all day.
...how long is my fishing line.
That I can fish from the top deck of Limsa.
Its infinity long.
As long as it needs to be but not more.
Really need to fix that.
Whatevers wrong with it.
Do y'all need to borrow some weather?
No don't need more rain.
Now it works.
I don't know what changed.
I tried to debug it.
Then it magically worked on the test version.
Then i tried it here again and it worked here.
You were saying v.
Found the issue.
So the problem was that some numbers precipitation levels i thought were whole numbers.
But sometimes they were not.
And that broke it.
It's kind of reassuring to know that type errors never stop happening.
...ok now I just don't have trousers.
Bright side I'm for now dressed entirely in one colour.
Are you wearing tiny leather pants ?
Thats an item thats in the game.
Enjoy that phase.
Ofc you pick the furry race.
It was either that or potato.
What about the dragon waifu/husbando race.
Need the expansion.
I am now more dressed.
Specifically I have an eyepatch.
Should've gone with Roegadyn I.
Cooked_Auto alas I am not ChaosSmurf.
Sure is a jrpg this game.
So here I was in the middle of your usual random encounter.
This enemy type either casts aoe fire magic or flees.
Well as I am farming XP of course it flees.
Same enemy type Turns 1 My group misses it misses its buff spell.
Second turn my team misses it again misses the run.
There is something terribly wrong in this world.
Turn 3 all miss.
Same turn 4 what the fuck is going on here.
The true JRPG experience.
Whiff whiff whiff.
Fight took so long I built my what passes for my limit break.
Didn't think that plan through.
<- behold a persona 5 boss.
Is the cursor that makes you lose track of your own mouse also part of the in-game boss?
No tahts just me having a cursor over the video i'm clipping.
You are the true boss monster it seems.
Cooked_Auto yeah I was tempted to pre-order dark imperium because my GW were giving away art cards and they had a great blanchesque one but I really don't care for the models.
WOuldnt surprise me if you can find that on ebay after the 17th.
Still havent decided if I'm going to get the crb or not.
Cooked_Auto dark imperium novel spoilers.
Oh I've read those.
There was two /tg/ threads about them yesterday.
Aight only a couple of new things I hadn't read before.
Anathema D.
Huh Outsider has updated again.
As much as I love aria this world does not make any kind of sense.
Neo venezia is full of neo luddites. its like its run by some kind of extremely aesthetic fascist party.
Like apparently bicycles among other things are banned.
Only form of transport we usually see are old school gondolas. Oh and delivery boys get rad flying motorcycles apparently?
I must go my planet needs me.
Cooked_Auto related.
Yeah Ive seen that one in my feeds.
And I thought the animation quality couldn't get worse for the new berserk anime.
Then I saw that.
<- just a minute guys its time for my cameo in inferno cop.
I especially like that he has abs on his chest.
!note MairBear Holy shit Makoto following you around pretending to read som romance manga is amazing.
HotS PTR notes As a result of community-driven discussions we’re making all 13 Battlegrounds available for play in Versus A.I. Quick Match and Unranked modes.
... TIL LiLi had bolt of the storm on her talents...
Oh..accidentally finished the last season of aria.
I assumed it would have been as long as the previous season which was something like 26 episodes.
Instead it was 13.
Exalted is on again for the first time in a while.
Grah double epic drop in OW and neither are event items...
Starmetal just botched a temperance roll for putting up with inspection... by Lytek.
Noelor and so started the great war against heaven?
MoonWolf luckily Lytek's too busy being fascinated by our existence.
Good i suppose.
MairBear why is makoto's personal a motorcycle.
Because it's also a legendary pope.
Yes. Yes it is.
Why do popes do nuclear damage.
MairBear> do you want 80 mutual friendship childrens card game gold?
Who knows MoonWolf.
Can i watch.
I need to see someone win a childrens cardgame.
There is one condition.
You can't go Mair what is this deck more than twice.
Is that a communal amount of what is this deck? or two each.
So uhm yeah. I know the lovers arcana is like official love interest material but fuck that.
She has a bike.
And punches people.
And wears a biker outfit.
MairBear give me a an invite to watch your game.
I need to game the system.
Did you get it moon?
Thank you for the gold!
Thanks for the pack.
Meant to coin out a fucking stonehill but my apm was too good and hit hero power instead >.<.
Apm is the onlyh true thing that matters.
I'll see what I can do.
So... what *was* Mair's deck?
I promised not to comments on mairs deck.
From what I saw regular midrange hunter with deathrattle triggering.
MoonWolf GlennCuttlefish.
Sounds like this healer should learn to adjust better.
Great. got 8 games quest in hots.
One day remaining in booster.
There goes my morning.
The 8 game quest is a cause for celebrating!
It means you can let others stockpile and get value!
Also dear me I decided to give Durarara!! a try my first laugh came before the intro sequence was even done.
Mair you dont understand.
If I do that I will miss on chances of getting another 800 gold a day.
Never could get into durarara for some reason.
Maybe I'll give it another try at some point.
Image searched nuns only one porny result on the first page.
GlennCuttlefish omggg summertime!
Yayy summertime oh gods its too hot to do anything.
Sun is shining birds are singing my skin starts to melt as soon as it hits sunlight.
Ok idea of drawing nuns was a good one except...most of these clothes are so dark my second monitor which I use for references cant show the folds.
Sorry MairBear had to go outside for a while.
I'm about to play a few rounds now MairBear if you still feel like joining me.
GlennCuttlefish I will have to pass for the moment so go ahead for now.
I dont mind.
Oops already queued before I checked IRC anyway.
GlennCuttlefish lets do some fukken compstomps!
Had to help a delivery man find house again.
All right just finished that game as well.
All the doggos.
MairBear so it might just be me.
But so far persona 5 looks pretty easy ?
Like the palaces you can do in about a day if you bring some consumables.
Unless it requires days in between to do story stuff.
So its like YOU ONLY HAVE 2 WEEKS.
And you go in and do it in an afternoon.
Yeah the challenge is random bullshit killing you and losing a save room of progress.
And attrition from long dungeon hikes.
Aint that the truth.
Noelor someone finaly encoded a video! it only took a month! Jumping Sailor Moon Gif.
This episode starts with a great factiod.
Turns out umi has the worst taste in men of the three.
I think that was already established.
She dates cleff/ascot in the anime/manga respectivly.
Hikaru dates someone named Eagle Vision.
Oh no nishkriya's domain expires soon.
A thought that terrifies me remove pity timers/bad luck protection/minimum expectation from HS packs OW loot boxes.
Dread to think how much garbage we'd wade through from the probabilities playing out.
MoonWolf a classic.
And yeah that was a very anime thing to have happened.
MoonWolf got any quests needed doing??
-? I'm not that excited.
I do not.
But i'm willing to be an easy target.
Casual wild it is!
Just watching lp's anyway.
Hrm. Kay. Will let you know cos I do not relish one quest. But will try to grind out the other two in casual first.
Play 10 minions of 8 mana or more.
Thats not so bad.
I can just make a removal priest you make a ramp druid.
You don't kill me and i remove your big things untill you finish.
MoonWolf shall we this thing.
Gimme 5 minutes.
Need to do a thing.
I am good at videogames.
Spent a hour trying to understand why this thing wasn't working. going through FAQ's and boards to see if anyone has the same problem.
Turns out I did not have the button bound.
What the hell game.
So in skies of arcadia you unlock special moves with moonberries. I was under the impression these were somewhat rare. They have just been dropping from last 3 random fights.
I have now unlocked all of my main characters moves.
Farm some more.
For new party members.
I am done with farming for now.
I farmed for a 1% drop item last night and this morning.
Persona 5 you thought you were going to a fireworks festival with the girls in yukata but actually RAIN FUCK YOU.
GlennCuttlefish hots? D.
Suregimme a minute to finish this encounter.
MairBear waifu the shogi player for TACTICS.
I did actually waifu shogilady.
Suddenly alibaba on the phone.
MairBear okay so the game is trying Really hard what with intentionally assuming the wrong pronoun and never letting to protagonists guess it. But this whole Alibaba is Boss' Daughter thing is pretty fucking screaming obvious at the moment.
But its an interesting idea that someone would get you to target themselves.
Reinhardtbow road.
BwaS this is ... a thing.
That i'm watching.
I know right!
Well this week's tavern brawl just got a bit filthy for me.
Deck full of 'hallucination' plus some random own class spells.
Hunter vs priest get kabal courier kabal courier into flamewaker flamewaker into the 1-mana cycles.
And a free from amber into king krush lethal T8.
I need a shower.
Probably spoils.
I think this establishment is just messing with me now. They buy and sell information about new discoveries in the world. One of the discoveries I just found is an oasis. Ok fine thats a nice discovery in the middle of the desert.
However in its description it says it is still critical to caravans on land routes and remains lively as a center of trade and information.
Omfg google maps for ancient rome.
I always suspected gmaps was made just so their employees could rome about.
Exalted dramas.
I am learning that eating robots makes you beautiful.
NieR intensifies if you want to mumb.
You are learning that robot life is whack yo.
I'll mumble in a few minutes.
<- here is a neat thing.
!note Noelor a neat thing.
<< as if the conventions last year were crazy enough.
BwaS kppa news.
Comey just made reference to 'will someone rid me of this meddlesome priest' during one bit of questioning.
The senator questioning was all 'ah yes that was the line I was just about to use'.
Then spent half a minute defining in detail the date it was historically said who said it about whom and what the consequences were.
WE FUCKING KNOW THE THOMAS A BECKET STORY.
In case people have missed it.
Gotta love auriel players who pick res don't use it all game.
How kind of Steam to put Democracy 3 on 75% off at this time for the UK.
This'll keep me busy XD.
Welp first run taxed the fuck out of everything I could.
Made an egalitarian utopia where everyone got along asthma and alcoholism was on the down.
But big business left and I had multiple assassination attempts against me.
40-45% ish vote share at end of first term XD.
When in FFXIV do light armour classes rediscover trousers?
They're also into subway maps of things that are not subways ?
They're an archaeologist.
So actually stands a chance of understanding the roman part of that.
Rome Total War also helps.
But in any case.
MoonWolf MairBear is there an answer to my plea?
Somewhere around 40 or so ?
As in you're in a subligar thing? u.
A Hard Leather Subligar yes.
Generally every 2-3 levels and as I recall the harness sets are always sandwiched between other things. Keep eyes open for a Sarouel.
Actually what level you at?
Noelor do the Hall of the Novice stuff. It unlocks at 15 and gives you gear that will last till level 20 or beyond looks good better than most lowbie stuff by far and most importantly if you finish it you get a ring that gives you an EXP boost.
Who where what now?
I think your trainer gives you directions at lvl 15. Might be your original one specifically? Will head to the thing to show you what you're looking for.
I'm currently pissing about with my GUI so.
Find any of The Smiths But that's the limsa one.
Talk to them at level 15 and they'll talk about something it'll mention some duty being unlocked and that you can enter the Halls of the Novice. Those give you some ok exp nice items and the ring. which is equippable from lvl 1 gives +3 to all stats and +30 to exp gained.
Also you can do one for every class and the gear is seperate for mage tank and physical. Ring is the same.
Is MRD actually supposed to be a tank?
Also literally as soon as I finished messing with my GUI and turned in my next quest I got some trousers.
They are cool billowy pirate trousers =D.
You get a cool buccaneery shirt to match in case you had the dumb harness too D.
Oh yeah I got the shirt from class quest.
That first sentence genuinely required three readings to parse.
Noelor FFXIV its going to keep happening.
Noelor And yet you signed up with the rogues.
Also in that screenshot my cat-tits because pirate shirts can't be worn closed.
That would be scandalous.
MairBear I actually like theirs somehow?
I think because it actually feels like a cant.
But can you parse it first time?
Eh sometimes second.
Noelor look if i've learned one thing from that game is that all characters are exhibitionists.
All of them.
But only ever due to the vocabulary.
MoonWolf .... our realm is kind of a.... noteworthy case.
Its all of my sample size!
There's wardrobes aplenty all over I'm sure but Faerie was incredible.
MairBear oh it's training grounds.
But at noob level instead of max.
This game is fairly good about making people learn how to party.
People still just forget every lesson it tries to teach them half the time.
But it does try to teach.
All glory to lalakind.
Does any class actually yet have both MP buttons and TP buttons?
Or is having both bars just for the cross-class buttons?
Paladin uses both.
I think DRK uses MP for dps and TP for tank ?
Oh no I made a terrible mistake.
I melted all the cheese already on top of my burgers.
But I cant eat all of them now.
Bard/Machinist drain mana to give mana/tp regen to the party at times but..
I'm assuming Red Mage will use both for its stuff.
DRKs are both though it's hard to run out of TP as a DRK.
MoonWolf I'm watching this Hearts of Iron stream from... last week or whenever.
When FP was Iran.
And... wtd is going on in this alt history.
Oman just joined the alliance of the nordic countries.
Don't worry about it.
But remember! The real prize is the lesson you learned!
I value this gil more than kill adds but ok NPC.
Oh goody an uncertain exit poll result XD.
Oh right polls are closed.
I should just... go to bed soon huh?
If you want to avoid the stress.
Going to finish Learn2Dungeon.
Ok I lied I also did just one quest that turned out to be some multi-stage thing and now I'm meeting Merlwyb.
She looks... strong.
She has guns.
Also a voice!
She's my second favourite faction leader.
...Baderon is the worst.
Why do I keep expecting Y'shtola to be a monk.
She's a WHM.
Oh she also has a voice.
I switched the sound on because I thought the quest was nearly done then got told to go pick up a dress that turned out to be shoes.
WAIT ' IS PRONOUNCED HOW?!
What is pronounced how ?
Same way HS pronounces Y'shaarj obv v.
...ok I don't play that game with sound on either.
Lemme brace myself for a youtube.
...ok which cards actually say his name >.>.
I didn't mean HS itself more the casters/streamers etc.
Well I've only heard one pronunciation of Y'shtola and it was an NPC.
And the ' was e.
...they called an NPC Snake because his name gets bellowed over a codec.
I'm ok with these localisers.
I wanted to log out in the forest inn but even more exposition happened when I got on the airship ._.
Its going ot keep doing that.
No I finally got to the inn.
Forest exposition can wait until the weekend.
One of these days etc.
Are you sure thats a satan.
I thought they were green.
And had scales.
No robotic body.
Fixed just for you moonwolf.
I don't know why.
GlennCuddlefish but... why ?
Oh my goodness this SU episode.
Oh lordy half an hour game on Tomb.
Red team at like 50 takedowns blue team 20-something.
0 keeps on both sides back and forth staggering death timers nearly impossible to get the core lethal.
Went long enough I complete Taste for Blood on Azmodan.
... I just got a 6-kill with Pharah on a single concussive blast.
I that a cheevo for her or only for lucio ?
Yeh only needs a single though.
Bit irresponsible to mail a month. What if it got lost?
Hey mair have you hotsed for today?
I did a game but I can join for one.
Blizz hates me they give me fucking beetleborg genji <.
Well Still cant deal with watamote.
Watamote? now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time a very long time.
It's taken this many years for the pain to fade.
And 20 minutes for it all to come back.
Anathema did you watch The Hour a BBC drama from 2011 about a news show of the same name set up in the 50s.
Because I have only just realised it was from 2011 and was almost certainly written as a warning by someone?
But whats the agameplay like.
Like a co-op shooter I imagine.
Might be good. pity my computer wont probably run it.
Lol wat.
The opening monologue is pretty good.
My party was caught completely by surprise by the fact that the enemy faction is in this area.
Even after during last encounter with them they said well too bad our troops are already there.
What a twist.
Noelor the cute future transhumanist lesbians comic ended.
I guess I can catch up now.
TIL coconuts are surprisingly heat retentive.
Pulled this out of the oven an hour ago and the water inside was still hot.
Why... were you ovening a coconut ?
Is.... is that not normal? D.
It helps crack the shell so you just need to bonk it a bit more to seperate it from the edge.
We don't get whole coconuts.
We just get seperate coconut elements in packaging.
Never forget that King's Quest I is a spiteful game and something as simple as being on the wrong side of an interactable object will kill you.
Anyone feel like joining me in doing daily hots quest?
Just cooking breakfast.
Be a couple minutes.
Also if anyone is interested payday 2 is free for now on steam.
Until the 5 million copies run out.
Aaa accidentally started a game noelor.
K ping me when it finishes.
Ping noelor also MairBear.
Just missed it mair.
Get on mumble anyway I'll tell you when the next round starts.
They're only 1 day in to the Heroes mid-season global tournament.
And we've already seen samuro dva.
Tournament any good ?
Might watcha match or two.
I guess but they're doing a round robin grp stage ish first.
Bracket play and eliminations coming later in the week.
Ah nvm then.
Dva sounds good in pro games.
Not sure samuro is ?
Noelor no but I have heard of it.
You're going to get counter picked immediatly.
I didn't see the draft but it may have been a 5th pick grab.
Side order of one of the better mechanical teams and the rest of the comp was fairly 100 to zero all-in dive.
BwaS its a good thing that hots observer pick screen tells you the name of the hero that is being picked because i can't recognize half of these skins _0.
Aye the draft screen does have its gains compared to dota.
They run through 10 bans a game and you see a tiny thumbnail in the corner with no name callout.
BwaS so D.Va seems pretty good as a tank.
She's pretty infuriating.
Turns out its hard to dance like a centaur robot.
BwaS roll20 is sponsering a ... hots team ?
Formerly known as 'Team 8' from them being the 8th of 8 to get qualification to the league.
Also known as please sponsor us we suck and naming.
Also that they were 'chu8 my hotdog' named for popular streamer chu8 who set them up but then backed out once they made it as he realised he couldn't commit.
I have to say dota 2 placeholder teamnames like No Tidehunter were a lot better.
Chu8 also being the one who did 'roll a smurf throw games all the way down to bronze 5 climb it all the way up to GM' on stream.
Ah probably good they didn't get tied to him then.
T8 got to top 3 in the league for the Western Clash best 3 NA 3 EU 1 ANZ 1 LA.
Then finished highest of the NA teams so they performed rather well.
Then for this they got 3rd again won the playoff slot chained from 6th up to 2nd.
RIP Adam West.
He died ?
The characters name is Graham btw.
Yeah I was going to say don't read the Kings Quest LP.
Damn why is glenn away today I need truly awful musical puns.
Nobody needs that.
Yes BLM gimme your mana.
Its my mana now.
Demoning Gargoyle its a Kraken. it vomits merfok shaman onto the field.
Sure is a card.
MairBear suddenly everyone is about the cognative psience. and futaba hasn't even woken up yet.
With a p!
Makoto and hifume seem to be having a reverse he's my boyfriend stay away situation.
Wait no they have switched to befriending eachother.
So they can be nerds together.
Persona 5 nerdy girls edition.
Why does your teaher make lockpicks for you.
MoonWolf they know what kids are like.
Not sure thats a good reason.
Did someone say black mage changes.
Wait where is the happy part 30 seconds in its only suffering.
A minute in still no news of flare returning.
Minute 20 seconds still noflare.
I am saddened by this.
GlennCuttlefish but you get TRI-BIND.
Also you get to give the healers mp.
Moonwolf I need that mana.
To cast flare.
RDM is the better black mage.
How does it feel?
RDM is the best mage.
If i come back i'm dropping lancer for being able to cast 15 ability with the word ver stuckin front of it.
Summoner looks good these days.
You get a bahamut.
Are you fucking shitting me blizz?
One's currency second is duplicate vanilla skin.
MairBear i don't know what verMoonWolf would do but it'd look cool as shit.
How does it feel? <- makes me feel like not resubbing.
GlennCuttlefish just be a summoner embrace the painflare.
Why is World order so good?
Moonwolf no. Then I would have to move for my healers.
Where as if I play BLM healers should move for me.
No these days the WHM just moves you instead.
Thats why I have a spell to teleport me back into my leyline.
GlennCuttlefish is there more world order or just watching older ones?
Watching older ones.
This HotS stream turned into wow arena???
That's still a thing.
It turned intoa a terrible minigame.
Was it ever not terrible?
Match times always being 5 seconds or 5 hours. No middle ground.
I don't thin it was ever good.
But somehow enough people disagree blizzard keeps pretending its not a shit minigame.
Talking about wow pvp.
Kirisu hey look by the time anime hell finishes airing this'll be out too.
That was always sort of in the plan.
Just had a hots game on double warrior triple support playing tass.
<- its sfw for once.
Well that was an overwatch round.
146k damage done.
8 minutes on point not even a medal.
Did you win?
I had one of those teams who just could not shoot the mercy.
I was the only one chasing her.
I think I got a whole level from that game.
Look glenn mercy is not always standing in front of the reinhardt barrier.
And when she's floating around with her girlfriend I got no choice but to wait until tac visor's up.
There wasn'n even a pharah.
But since this is total mayhem.
Its kind of hectic even without.
Oh hey apparently there is a black sad game in developement.
Black sad ?
Its a comic book series.
Also apparently also blacksad and not black sad.
I'm still not seeing happy ends in any of these sidequests.
What did you expect.
Newconsole from microsoft.
X BOX X.
Or as it will be known as XBONEX.
Hi I'm XBoxxy?
Granted XBox One X is rather dire name.
OH SHIT XBOX ONE COMPATIBLE?!
Sure is VIDEO GAMES here.
They just unveiled...a new porsche model? what the fuck?
Yeah my entire social media is screaming their heads off about it.
For some reason.
New Metro game though it seems.
Didn't really care for the first one so I dropped the series.
Still looked solid.
I could never really play the remake games because my screen kept lagging after the game /.
Eeyup that's a mutant bear for sure.
I think assassins creed is going fate/assassin?
Profiling 4k footage... in 1080p stream.
It's going Egypt at least.
I think assassins creed is going fate/assassin? <- what ? there's going ot be magic powers and marble phantasms and it turns out you were never even a realm person and someone else summoned True Assassin ?
Well I meant more we're a prologue origin story so I was all so hashashin then?
But it's apparently gone full RPG with a side order of sniper elite.
Crossbow elite ?
No crossbows in Ancient Egypt =p.
Eh pretty sure they could have imported some from china.
Can they ditch the 'wearing a t-shirt beneath a suit jacket above a pair of jeans and trainers' guys?
They're trying to be hip BwaS.
What's the next MSoft console gonna be? XBOX ONE X II?
It's pretty much just XBone Pro.
MairBear its going to be Shin-Xbox.
ჯᏰṎჯ ṎṈ⁅ ჯ ?
Oh boy more minecraft.
That looked dope I'll be honest.
What is this hipster bullshit.
!note anathema Now you too can have THE TOUCH OF GOD.
Huh Terry Crews in Crackdown 3. I'm game.
Might just be in that trailer.
Yeah but doomfist when though ?
Like cuphead never ever.
But Cuphead got a release date =P.
Life is Strange 2 just got shown it seems.
Does it fix the end of 1 if no. i don't care.
Its about time travel though.
Doesn't have to stay a prequel.
At least that is what I'm getting from my social media feeds because I'm not actually watching the stream v.
Oo new ori game.
Also Xbox original one games backwards compatible for Xbone is not a bad idea.
$499 flop confirmed.
Then again its an xbone it was going to flop anyway.
And with gbp-usd exchange rates that is gonna be one very expensive coffee table decoration.
Potg ulti shutdown kill a 76 about 8 secs into his tac visor v.
Dva potg for an enviro kill for 2 D.
On a tryhard lucio/mei duo q in mayhem brawl too.
MoonWolf needs the dominus voice line.
Almost enough to make me work in london.
Well its official now. I have become a wellfare bum |.
Nothing shoujld make you work in london anathema.
Jesus christ my head is artistic today. The impression left on my phone after holding it against my wet hair is a perfect wine formation. I would take a photo of this shit if it was not imprinted on my camera.
GlennCuddlefish front-camera + a mirror + somehow turn the screen off?
Sadly this art was short lived and it dried up already.
Welp a whole load of nothing.
I'll check a few episodes of fate/apocryphy.
I'd be surprised if you didn't =P.
New game! 2... really missed a jump there.
Dive!! because Free! proved gay baiting guys in speedos sells ?
Pretty sure it did.
Then you also had gays on ice.
Still waiting for Bara on fire.
Ah the good old fashioned closeted gamer cliche still in 2017.
Come on Japan...
They also have a two girls wait no one is just crossdresser romance.
High school slice of life... with a centaur!
Its less silly than many other things ?
MAL fastidious. don't be an arse with a thesaurus.
But thats one of my hobbies BwaS.
Apparently the manga that one is based on has moments of... weird.
The Wolfenstein 2 trailer was great amounts of spectacular cheesy action as a side note.
You dissing new game! ?
Just the name i think.
Anathema So I just preordered/bought one of the Primaris Lietenants of a bitz site because I want to paint at least one of them. Only £7.90 including shipping.
If anyone feels like doing some hots at some point let me know since I am doing my daily.
7 games remaining.
Its one of those rounds.
I am sitting at 20k hero damage done.
Our ragnaros 0.
Nah they aint even afk.
Gotta love when I get a spambot on blue and the loss comes in to punish the cunt.
XCOM2 expansion reveal right now btw.
With more green zombies.
Also an energy sword.
Oh no gameplay.
THey namedropped Advance Wars Smurf is most likely pleased and pissed at the same time.
Well that entire thing was an absolute drag.
I'm going to choose to believe you were watching Rocky Horror.
Running team league placements for seasonal mount.
Reminded that diablo-tyrande is apparently still a thing.
PTSD from early 2016 meta.
Stun into giant stun ?
Jesus fuck they got Miyamoto to talk about the Rabbids/Mario crossover.
Truly this is the worst timeline.
Yeah It's Mario XCOM v.
I think this is the first time I have not wanted a game that has competent gameplay made.
Duckssake period adaptations of shakespeare are not calls for political assassination...
BwaS they totally are.
Murder literally every subject of a ceasar adaptation.
Which is probably every president ?
Well they had tank-less hyper carry illidan comp earlier today.
And now we get lost vikings.
Surprisingly from the SEA team.
It got worse.
They went morales medivac backdoor keep core base race strat.
Did not pull it off 3 levels down XD.
Welp Ubi just unveiled Beyond Good Evil 2.
...I put my phone down for 5 seconds and that shit happens.
Cooked_Auto did not see that coming.
No one did.
Jesus fuck that trailer.
Considering how experimental todays meal is this turned out pretty good.
How experimental are we talking here ?
Experimental as in heres a bunch of stuff I have no idea how to utilize and some things I usually hate.
Fried some chicken made a broth of that some mushrooms onions garlic and ginger then combined that with noodles and miso.
Those do look good.
I accidentally read hackernews comments on a diversity article again. nazis everywhere.
Sotp reading Hn.
Anathema uh oh.
I'm imagining taro just sort of mashing it into his mask.
To be fair the british have stolen so many pieces of egyptian history that it could almost pass as Egypt snerk.
Mage activates elemental synergy card in an otherwise disconnected deck.
By playing flame geyser off a primordial glyph.
Fucking love this garbage.
Trying to replace my tyre with brute force on sunday has given my some serious DOMS in some hand muscles.
So Metroid Prime 4 is now a thing.
Metriod prime 4 lets pretend other m didn't happen.
Let's see how they retcon Prime surviving having an entire planet surrounding her blow up and the entire source of her energy made inert galaxy wide.
Wasn't a fan of the control scheme in Prime 3 tbf.
FUCK YOU SKIN JUST SLOWS ME DOWN WHEN I AM STABBING.
So they are also releasing a Metroid 2 remake it seems.
Arts and crafts yoshi.
So the new gimmick is hts and possession.
Oh my just won a team league game on hanamura.
29 kills to 6 and we didn't have a tank v.
Somehow had a zero death game as zeebo vs zera plus double warrior.
Looks like Squeenix has something NierA related in store.
BwaS or MoonWolf want sum 80g in cardgames?
MairBear i have 80g in cardgames money on offer too.
Sadly I dont P.
Odd we knew of kiwami already.
Maybe its a localization confirmation ?
Probably release date in August.
Why do I never watch dva's use their primary fire while as pilot after dropping their nuke...
Well that was odd.
Blizz it seems left the anniversary event and double xp up a day longer than scheduled.
Surprise farm new arcade weekly on the event drops.
Rolled over to standard just near the end.
First return regular loot box 3 commons and a rare. Standard.
Suddenly robosexuals. How heretical.
Its just not the same without blue hair.
Time for badly drawn glenns doodles again.
Why a blindfold ?
All glory to lalakind.
And I couldn't be bothered with eyes.
I give it a 6/10 on the Geop scale. A decent pun but not one of the awful groaners.
Unless the scene in which that happens is set by a natural water source that's barely even a pun so much as a reference.
Nah its from falling off a beanstalk.
Apparently it is a time for you to be on mumble.
Because happy endings are happening.
Glenn thought you mentioned wanting to be here for this.
Anathema So Warmaster is going to be available for purchase at the Black Library Weekender in November.
I guess yesterday was a bit of a fluke then with 19C and almost clear skies.
I see Finnish black magic has happened.
I'll enjoy it for the week it lasts.
Harsh burns by jeph from the overwatch team.
So apparently BGEE has Steam Trading cards now. Got 5 today randomlyh.
Is that what was happening ?
I got updates but then i looked at my inventory and i couldn'ts ee what i actually got.
And later it was just you can't look at your inventory right now go away.
Steam is so rude sometimes.
Yeah I had that as well but when I refreshed it I noticed cards that werent there before.
Okay just had a rogue play Deathwing 2 against me that they got off Prince Malchezaar.
In my Anyfin Can Happen this is lethal fuck you for being Reno Imma clear your board turn.
Deathwing 2 popped into 2 more Deathwing 2's.
Thistle Tea. fucking Thistle Tea.
It mostly just sat there as topdecked Aldor just the turn after it was played.
Good Acolyte engine.
Fucking hate decks like that tbh.
A reno deck is /not/ 29 random cards plus reno esp when 1 of those 29 is the one diluting your deck with an extra 5 such you can't find reno!
What the flying fuck is this e3 stream from squeenix.
Its emils e3 extravaganza.
The shop music is playing on loop.
They jump right into one of the most spoilerrific boss fights. all the hosts are wearing wigs.
When asked about yoko taro what is going on he only answered Curse of blackbox.
Well it had been a while since I last experienced being trolled by that group.
<- finally a mod that fixes stardews biggest issue your pet isn't a mimikyu.
Moonwolf turns out that everything I had heard about the nier concert story ending was true after all.
It was sad ?
I will say this Everything I had heard was truebut incomplete.
GlennCuttlefish rip the Berseria plan.
Apparently early access started.
Time to play redmage instead.
Will you be spending all day on that or do you have time for a few hots rounds before I possibly skedaddle?
Fear not I dont have the 8 games quest today.
This entire convo oh boy. This is going to be magical.
Love those moments when you have a bit of a board state and damage from hand.
You think this could be lethal I'm not sure but it's def a lot so let's just go.
And turns out to be exact damage \^^/.
3x I make it to the rank 17 border matchup.
Annnnnd then it's loss streak all the way down to rank 20 plus zero.
You can't lose stars at this rank well fuck you.
Oh we made it so you can't fall from 15.
You can't climb to 15 either.
Kain_Spoo you'll be happy to know installed a pirated copy of berseria.
Sure is fun getting 20 minute games against freeze casino mages at rank 19...
Bloody annoying when they stubbornly cling on all the way to their last draw against an unfavoured matchup.
Pop the possibly reno mage's ice block at 1.
Empty hand top deck a coldarra drake.
I gave you a window to honourable sudoku ping your own face.
For your insolence brann yogg happened and the God of Death starfired you.
I hope you're happy.
Egh I was at a fair amount of life from earthen scales play.
They wanna go haha two fireblasts of defiance against your 20 armour! they get what's coming.
You're OK MoonWolfm unlike that traitor MairBear.
Wait what? D.
These VerFlares wont cast themselves.
You know it will be a magical day when after a night drinking and 6 hours of sleep you are woken up to a phone call and the first thing you hear is TEKKEEN COME PLAY TEKKEEN.
Also Hopes and dreams / SAVE the world is still the hypest shit to come out of indie games.
Oh man this game defaulted to windowed fullscreen.
A good start.
Tomorrow is the night that 7 years ago something terrible happened i hope nothing terrible happens tomorrow.
That npc just doomed this village.
Calling it now.
Thats a first my phone weather app and PS source agrees.
Both say 21C in this case.
MoonWolf imperials have some big monster things called canis whatever.
FATE involving them Yes this is Dogs.
Me to Noelor today oh why didn't you tell me you were going to our local con this yr?
Noelor to me today oh why didn't you tell me you were going to our local con this yr?
Maybe next time you should like.
I should yes.
But I remember they got a bit bummed out by it 2 yrs ago and didn't go last yr so yknow.
*friend dragged me down because they wanted to do a cosplay thing.
I wasn't going to before that.
Didn't parse it as cosplay looked regular clothes to me P.
It was a v. v. v. low-effort Archie.
As in DC U?
I think yakuza 0 has a sadly forgotten miracle of the modern world.
I am pretty sure this dumpster fire has been burning for 30 years straight.
A very serious game.
Alisaie i like the new outfit but would it hurt if you didn't literally have the exact same face and body as your brother.
Its a litle creepy.
Not as creepy as when you were doing the creepy identical twin clothing.
Freaky Fish Gu- Girl.
Help I am being mugged buy some kind of mutant neckbeard.
I am not even kidding.
Kain_Spoo why does punching him give you money?
Because getting hit is losing you money.
This is pretty good.
Aww shit Garden of Terror is back in rotation.
The local-con charity auction this afternoon got pretty wild pretty fast.
They started off auctioning one of the committee member's bananas.
Then it was the shirt off his back 2016 localcon merch they had around the corner for a fraction of the price paid.
Then a glass of tap water he was drinking from.
Before finally the rights to shave off his beard and chest hair.
Also as a bid threshold 'sweetener' for a sort of latex statue severed head he had to kiss it.
!note MairBear.
Welp seems like the XCOM2 expansion lets you control aliens.
I think if glenn lived here he'd be a puddle.
It was 30+ here a couple of days ago.
It's a duplicate.
But still better than my blue card.
I think I actually got a duplicate alex back in the day as well.
Oh goddamnit final fantasy.
Checked it was done last night before going to bed booted up fine.
Now there is a 4 gig patch again.
Ah well. back to being unimaginably rich in yakuza then.
Also oh no I need to buy a new mouse of this. I just dont have enough keys available now.
Ff14. the standard issue of running out of keys.
Well keys that are quickly available to you.
So I looked into my current rotation.
Saw that its 21 steps long. Considering going red mage after all.
How many flares are in those steps ?
Oh wait I was wrong.
That was the opener.
My current aoe rotation has 3 flares.
Oh right this guide is for level cap forgot I should follow the earlier versions for a while.
Ok the actual single target rotation is really easy.
Well assuming I dont have to move.
You have to move.
No the healers have to adjust.
They gave you a teleport to your leylines to make moving easier.
Its not actually the leylines part.
Its keeping up enochian there is one point where its kinda iffy if you have to move.
Guess I could drop one fire4 from the rotation in that case.
But even that is a lot lot easier now.
I like that the end part of my aoe rotation is just are they still alive and flare spam every 5 seconds.
Aaaa I need to increase ilevel to continue everything is terrible.
Oh thank gods poetics are a thing I can use and had stocked up.
I thought you said you didn't.
I thought I didn't.
Fortunately I was wrong.
Also dagnabbit mair wake up already I need to discuss weapon options.
Oh my god. I saw this poetics coat and thought i need to get a monocle to go with that.
The had on the set comes with a monocle.
The outdoor section is pretty amazing.
Brawl option low grav all the maps as normal but playing out like it's fucking quake or something.
Makes lucio ult ridic as doesn't cast til he hits the floor and no-one hits the floor.
A good mod.
I love watching hail mary yoggs sometimes.
This one from the dreamhack vod starts by meteoring his own board so yogg takes 3 follows up by finishing off yogg with holy fire.
10 mana heal self for 5!
Oh goody webspinner brawl.
Where it doesn't matter if you misplay yourself off the fucking map.
Because blizz will just give you tundra rhino king krush core hound versus captains parrot.
Heroes Brawl also managing to crash the game client to the point of it forgetting what region I play in after its map ending in a 5-5 draw declared as a victory.
Blizz approach to terribly weighted atk/def map have red/blue switch sides.
But at least an improvement on its first outing when all you got was a coin flip on a win/loss.
But i'd still prefer the gwent mechanic.
Just after I saw my 3rd alexstrasza from a classic pack.
Jade druid. t1 innervate jade blossom. t2 innervate nourish draw. t3 double wild growth. lunar visions jade behemoth.
Ultra low curve druid class cards. coin druid saber. mark yshaarj. enc raven enc raven mark lotus.
Add additional druid saber mark lotus. g fucking g.
Okay now that was turn 4 exact lethal vs cthun possibly nzoth as well priest.
Hey look steam sale.
Steam done being down ?
Looks like it.
With both discounted kerbal is still a fiver more than battlefleet gothic. lawl.
Go back to hero league for seasonal placements.
First map blackheart with it now back in the rotation.
Absolutely demolished them 14 kills to 1 4 level lead at one point.
They had double warrior plus varian versus our sylv def not her best map.
So possible upset looking at the draft.
Love games like that where I get to play full macro with falstad et al and have it work out.
We can finally download highlights in-client and make our own crosshairs.
On replay review a dominant fraction of that hero league win may well have been red brightwing being a bot 75% of the game.
But nonetheless XD.
Eh it was probably a better healer than the real one.
Mebs not when the varian player took BW as a pocket for the bot lane while ours had value in the more heavier skirmish top-mid.
Considering I have about 6 billion yen now my plot debt of 500 million is starting to feel kind of irrelevant.
6 billion yen.
Yeah. the game thinks 2 million for chapter completion bonus is a suitable reward. maybe I broke something along the way.
Goal buy no games this steam sale.
Thats my goal too.
Its really easy if you have no money!
Ah I love it when the 9 death Uther wants to lecture others on poor positioning...
If you'd positioned right he wouldn 't have died.
Oh my positioning was mostly fine my death count was the lowest p.
Toast on match point v Kolento in a reverse sweep potential with Yogg Quest Mage.
TMW one competitor is in tryhard C9 tshirt vs some streamer in self fanart merch.
Funsies at 50 sec.
Anathema So I had superluck with auctions yesterday won a full squad of unpainted Kriegers and bought the Daemonhunters codex.
The low grav mode on OW makes pharah play interesting never needs to land <3.
It makes lucio OP.
So good.
How to sum up that last game on Oasis.
Switched to bastion was orisa.
Made perfect sense.
Let's just park up as a static immobile fire magnet discarding any coordination and hope to left click things.
But orisa isn't any of those things ?
Wrong way around.
I'm good at language.
How they played their orisa all game was exactly how you'd play a bastion.
They got dived hard and their barriers were only for them to sit on at the very back corner of the point.
She's pretty easy ot play too.
Like a more mobile reinhard that doesn't need to hit people to hurt them.
And a ultimate you basically cannot waste if you have any sense.
Well this is bronze division so...
Wait for the teamfight.
Deploy your free make team better at teamfight cylinder.
Its got a huge range.
Do people have Thoughts about AMD vs Intel chipset for a gaming PC?
I have no clue about those things these days.
My thoughts kinda are intel as a safe option and perhaps cos I roughly know the scaling i3 5 7.
No clue what amd does.
But here's me with a 4+ yr old laptop as their main.
In my professional non-opinion you don't need a i7 unless you know you need an i7.
Games really don't care about multithreading enough to make it wortwhile regular desktop use won't even touch it.
<< Shelter tie-in merch of all things.
BwaS whatever sells too nerds.
Route 66 game where the golden box of victory was as near as 'that first bridge/gantry before it turns left around the corner at the petrol station' v.
<- here have some competence porn.
Fucking love the ones who think you're their pocket to combo ults with.
You wanna shoot for the dream whatsit drop on a graviton that's cool.
Whole lot of gameplay besides that and would help if you werent staggering death timers when the window is there.
It's tiiimeeeeee!
Oh shit they did more?
I thought it was an April Fools thing.
Nah they have done Imps and now Trolls.
Noelor It keeps happening.
The chain of stimpacks I've managed to keep up since hots 2.0 launched has now expired.
Rip my xp.
Buff squares nerf circles. Triangles are okay.
Square circle triangle no cross? jeez what a bunch of haters.
They have to leave something for the expansion.
GlennCuddlefish so this is an attack in niera i never knew about.
We should just face it.
Nier automata is actually just about sex robots.
It really is.
I'd watch it but mostly for the kego.
Sure is fun when the 'acknowledged' spamming wankshafts are all on your team get a win and never get to see the faults in their play.
Also the ones who take until 90% on KOTH to realise the comp needs switching up ie more than 0 heals and 1 tank.
Fuckssake dont come to ilios complain of your low win rate there as you observe a 0 support team mould besides your hanzo lock in.
BwaS HotS imminent if you wanna join?
Nah fixing up to head to the shops soon.
Always get the fucking braindeads who ping retreat somewhere but end up going there anyway.
I think the spackers just see it as just some generic ping tool to get people's attention with no fucking clue of specific use.
Love those games against a warrior where they open t1 nzoths first mate w/o a patches.
But it's all a bait as they proceed to play a tempo style game including dropping a brawl.
Oh look there we go another 'wait until the fuse starts burning turn 1 before playing your quest card'.
You're in a favoured matchup anyway.
<- the best reasons.
Too bad tychus got nerfed to shit.
BwaS can't nerf that bulge.
Oh jeez /two/ tychus legendary skins do you want speedos or board shrts.
Ok tested them out pretty sure boardshorts tychus and speedos tychus are functionally identical in cosmetics adjustments.
Barring choice of swimwear.
Board shorts tychus costing less ingame currency.
Having him shoot a supersoaker is probably the best representation of his damage levels to be fair.
Men are just horrible sometimes.
Kill all humans.
Huh TIL the main cinema in town has changed ownership. 3rd firm and it's only been there 15 ish years.
>Pool noodle Illidan.
Cthun priest opens with t1 mind vision gets my The Coin.
Goes all in on a Dragonkin Sorceror Inner Fire bomb without the Inner Fire.
Didn't count on me having a second Hex in hand by turn 4.
Caverns below you know. the only quest that sees competitive play.
Powerful versus several slower control-oriented decks.
By which we main anything which isn't ultra turbo murloc aggro paladin and pirate warrior.
I dont fucking get the OW community right now.
They're on a hate train of 'mercy is a one-trick pony and mercy mains climb ladder too easily'.
When last month they went off that support mains couldn't gain SR and rank up as fast as damage players.
Mercy is very obviously a two-trick poney.
Heal-mercy and the suprising amounts of damage mercy.
Also as a side thing.
If anyone should be the best at climbing ladder.
It should be the bloody supports.
You know the guys everyone needs but nobody seems to want to play.
So I set out to buy a hard drive today.
Ended up reserving a time to an optometrist and sitting on the terrace drinking with friends insteadx.
Thats okay too.
MoonWolf is it just me.
Or is this weeks brawl Pick Patches.
I picked light of the naaru.
Going to see how thats workign out soon.
Apparently jade idol is worth a try.
Or maelstrom for a counter to patches.
My plan beat a books only mage.
Oh god jeweled macaw hunter vs my stonehill defender warrior.
Won T3 with my jades up to 5 vs swashburglar rogue.
Stonehill?! bit slow surely.
I had a quest to play taunt minions and also expected nothing but patches xD.
Alright then p.
Duplicate alakir S to follow that duplicate alex the other week.
His jeweld scarap gave him a hobgoblin so now he's spamming 3/3 parrots D8.
Thats worse rng than webspinner shit...
Well I guess webspinner could chain into that.
Into hyena D.
Kay this brawl may be pretty farmable.
Arcane missiles mage...?
Okay so light of the naaru doesn't win against patches.
But it mmakes them quit in frustration sometimes.
Seems jade idol doesn't win either.
Fucking jebaited me saw shaman so thought maybe maelstrom to counter queue.
Nah just counter counter queue.
Hey look at me I spent valuable dust to make a stonetusk boar to win 1 week of tavern brawl.
Mind vision priest.
Vs my stonehill defender.
I'm 100% okay with making terrible gimmick cards for terrible gimmick brawl decks.
Haha this instance one of the rng class cards is best girl.
Second Arcane missiles mage.
Huh a living roots druid.
Remember last time this was out and it was all fucking naturalises and shit.
Okay that was a weird one.
Patches mage I concede midway through the cannons but some reason they conceded too and thejrs procced first.
I just had the worst plan.
Seeing a lot of golden portraits tonight.
Legend ladder closed or something?
I seem to be against an iron hide warrior.
I think i win this match.
In about 15 rounds.
Jade idol druid looks favoured vs mind blast priest.
Turns out the meta can shift with new releases.
Took out the iron hide warrior finally.
Also floated mana raven idol into living scales lololol.
'lol a prince malchezaar priest.
Ran into the 60 cards in a deck limit.
Brave archer hunter this brings me back.
Malchezar priest did not hold up to upgrade warrior.
Farming this brawl sure helps put my mind of the massive loss streak I had on OW ladder today.
Man my last set of golems split tanked that arc missiles mage like a boss!
And that's a heroic strike warrior with coined out bash? pounded.
Full P2W patches that last one. Golden plus Khadgar mage.
Saw my first maelstrom shaman of the night.
Counter queueing the counter queue matchup feelsgoodman.
Still think light of the naaru priest was cool.
Lol you can set your deck to the quest cards.
It is just a card.
Man this looks bad.
You know what if the xmen invaded earth from the moon isn't actually a very good take marvel.
Well they can't do X-Men anyway so they're pushing Inhumans hard to the detriment of everything else.
Hence why the roster in the latest MvC is so bad.
Hahar mind blast priest drops the premature well player without knowing jade idol wins the base race.
BwaS have you seen the murloc thing some people did.
It seems better than jade idol.
Since every murloc boosts all of them.
The 1/1 +1 the 1/2 +1 each the 2/3 +1+1?
Bahaha already at today's gold cap from brawling ^^.
Oh my god yes.
Jfc that Warlock set.
That is not a good set.
None of these are good\.
Rip tier 21.
Stop being wrong |.
Wow that game UI looks way too good.
Although that is one movie I would see but just not pay for it.
Right time to shut down this thing and install a new HD.
I still think they're gonna play the Terokk switcheroo.
I read that as Turok.
And assumed a very delayed E3 reaction.
Man this bug is bugging me.
For some reason ff14 is just not in my steam library.
So I have to launch if through the store page.
Just find the executable in the directory and shortcut that ?
I'll probably do it once I am done with project move all 30 gigs of this bloated beast to a new HD.
22 seconds to load hots seems an improvement.
Faster drive ?
Yeah. also you know not a repurposed external from 6 years ago.
Also got a new mouse with more buttons than I know what to do with.
And annoyinigly a lot of leds.
...annoyinigly? thats the most racist typo I have made in ages.
Not many racist typos then.
Argh I had forgotten this blight upon nerdkind.
I mean Ive managed to rub off the Logitech logo on my mouse and its just a blank spot now.
Well that lalafell tried.
Their name is anangrypolarbea Polar.
Ok I really need to upgrade my net connection one of these days.
Started downloading something from steam sale estimated time is 10 hours.
Another fantastic episode of 'my opponents have no fucking clue how lucky they are'.
The inconsistent reno decks that are made even less consistent by a malchezaar but still find reno before you find your win condition.
The netherspite turn 2 activated by a sole chromaggus into a deathwing.
The top-decked cabalist tome into double unstable portal 1 into rag.
Well finally finished LWA.
That was just about the best ending scene that series could have.
Yknow I still need to get myself a pair of those...
Guess the sales will be boosted.
So good luck finding any now p.
Wouldn't dream of getting those myself.
Yeah no prefer earplugs.
I think the ladies would swoon and faint with the sight of me sporting those on top of my linux beard and fedora.
> linux beard.
Is that like the xkcd cheat shirt only it's your facial hair bearing it?
No but just as stylish.
Anathema I'm sure I asked this before but I cant find it in logs so are you still planning on visiting finland during summer and if so when?
23rd to 29th.
!note Noelor In the story of the larger game Wabash was basically abandoned by Washington and left to fester.
Anathema what even is wabash.
Did they make that place up?
All the states were fake although some others were closer to real ones like 'Ahao'.
Wabash was fake Indiana one of our cities was Gary.
Even if there is a city in Indiana called Wabash.
Ofcourse there is fucking americans.
Oh yeah I had it confused with BosWash for some reason.
Anyone know if there are pictures of the surface of Ganymede or Europa? or if we at least know what they'd look like? considering using them as inspiration for basing my marines.
There are pictures.
As colour schmes go ganymede is boring as hell.
Europa is marginally more interesting.
Hmm maybe I should go with Mars instead then.
Europa has some distinctive streaking going on.
That might be interesting.
Might also look crap though.
Just had a HotS game feature a lost vikings mirror.
Dont see that every day.
Kills for everyone.
Anathema turns out juno has a cool set of colours.
Jupiter as seen by juno*.
It's always the solely-dps lockers who are the first to plead 222 in team chat.
Haha watching one of my highlights.
Soundwave enviro kill on a basty in sentry form off an orisa grav.
Getting a round in comp where you get to splash out on your dps main for once poppin' off and gettin' potg <3.
MoonWolf thanks think I'm gonna go with Mars red though.
The half life 1 speedrunner on sgdq was 2 years younger than the game.
GlennCuttlefish the LWA game is apparently headed for Steam.
Curse the Icosahedrax.
<- double gold INSECT.
Oh wonderful a deck building tavern brawl with no information about what gimmick you're going in to to build for.
Something really bothersome about those mages who pop a flamestrike turn 7 solely off natural card draw with no cycling.
Playing some AI games of jade druid.
Just dropped a 47 spell yogg.
Before it hit poison seeds and made itself into a tree.
Dodged two meteors an evolve and fired up a commanding shout along the way.
It dodged an evolve ?
Oh no 11 mana creatures so it can't go up.
Watching some OW korean esports vod and one of the support players has battletag 'LUCID'.
To add insult they're rolling Zen.
Built a bit of a casino mage deck for the rank 20 monthly push.
Throw in acidic swamp ooze golakka crawler get pirate warrior second match.
Golakka in opening hand they passed first two turns patches was in hand before a first pirate was played.
Burning mortal strike on a golakka don't mind if you do mate.
Beating cthun priest with a primordial glyph assisted fireball chain <3.
Also known as bullshit.
Beating them with bullshit.
They made the AI much better in the Wipeout 2048 in the Omega collection I can't easily win every race on the lower settings anymore o_0.
Oh no not competitoin.
Whatever will you do.
On the easiest circuit with easy AI?
But is it bullshit rubberbanding or not?
I know you want to make high octane anime versions of everything but quizz shows just dont work if you cut the question earlier than halfway through.
Have some Jeff from the Overwatch team.
That dont sound like terry crews...
Had Blizzard not cared about regional accuracy for characters it might have happened.
> regional accuracy.
> tracer's from flippin harrogate.
I am sure there are Africans annoyed about Orisa's accent too.
BwaS if Tracer were from actual London she'd speak in MLE.
Ie Luv would instead be Fam.
Among other things.
So allow dramatic license tbh.
The wider point is that most of the VAs are from the relevant country.
DPS Tanky's having a bit of a punchout party on PTR looks like.
And this is also true of Tracer.
The wider point is was being facetious.
201039 the wider point is that most of the VAs are from the relevant country.
Or at least rel3evant upbrinbing.
Anathema I've been reading some other debriefings and after action reports and it seems like most of the states were in fact abandoned by the White House.
So his heroic is basically ETC Stage Dive but fired like Chromie's Dragon's Eye.
He's very fisty.
Dont think his AA has much going for him but looks like it's a recharge rather than a reload.
He's really mobile.
For a guy with a giant fist and a shotgun.
...man I really wanna hear a MLE version of Tracer now though.
I don't really.
U wot mate.
Déja vu innit?
Multicultural london english. honestly I have never heard of that title.
I mean I get what it's referring to and I see it's treated as standard naming...
...he put a shotgun into each of his knuckles.
The doomiest fist.
Noelor notably he put them in the knucles of the nonfist hand.
Because a giant doomfist alone wasn't enough.
He also needed a completly seperate shotgun fist.
That is actually the less doom of his fists.
Civ VI discovery you can invent steam power without inventing the wheel.
BwaS please advise how that would work.
It really wouldn't.
Even if you could invent pistons without wheels.
The gearing needed to actually convert form rotation to force or back.
Requires gears thus wheels.
MoonWolf this was my thinking.
Always love when someone gets their POTM only by virtue of your graviton lining them up for you.
Even better when they're toxic cancerous little cunts already on your blocklist from the game beforehand!
Blue team defence. pick torb and basty at the last fucking second such that no setup before red assault begins.
Pick into a pharah comp.
Remain stubbornly sitting on those two heroes as red breeze through first and second.
Everybody gets to be a deathknight.
Is it bad that I was freeze framing that flooding video trying to place the locale?
GlennCuttlefish you free on the 19th for DW?
BwaS hearthstone magic.
I call shenanigans no way that TB can get to fatigue.
All I see are grim patrons on curve filling a board and winning T6.
Must have been an early attempt.
When people were still farming small 1 health minions for slightly bigger fireworks on their wow emote.
Okay all of this guy's demos have had them vs 'f2pnoob'.
Playing solitaire with an alt acc.
HS casters are so full of shit sometimes...
The aggressively curved midrange paladin.
What that a midrange paladin with some more 2 drops ?
Well it def runs both tidecaller and inquisitor murlocs in 1 drop.
Goes as high as at least tarim.
I guess there are worse ways to spend a friday night. eating some poorly made sushi and watching japanese food dramas.
Its a drama but the show always revolves around food somehow. This one is less feel good than gourmet samurai but still a good watch so far.
Not a fan of tuna on sushi it turns out. this preserved salmon on the other hand is great.
I think its cured with salt sugar and dill.
!note Noelor.
<- queen victoria was #agile.
Man OW ladder really starting to take its toll.
Climbed like 900 SR this season close to 100SR from busting into silver.
Becoming a real see saw every session.
Weird when the weekly 40 dust is only 20 dust but the rare that comes with it is fairly mediocre S.
MoonWolf the 'Ask the devs' thread has 810 answers in nishkriya I really ought to write a search.
Enjoy doing that.
I have no clue how to search.
There is only one other topic with more than 100.
<- holy shit a non gimmicky use of AR.
Getting 7 enviro kills in one 3-0 on Ilios as Lucio.
Plus potg for 3 of them in one burst.
Sure is a good game when the tracer mccree 76 are all fighting over who should switch roles.
Anathema.
MoonWolf ^^^ wts is Smokin' Cheddar BBQ from?
Noelor no clue so probaly from the gatcha.
Oh that's Arturia.
Could've sworn I've linked the Saber breakdown before.
Ah yeah Saber as a Lancer.
Its all about Scherazade now anyway =P.
Til Kyon from Haruhi also voices Winston in OW.
Kirei Kotomine in all the Fate dubs.
Kirei is just Kyon after he got sick of Haruhi's shit.
Some real bullshit from a rank 19 paladin just now.
Running both rag light and tirion.
Lands the handbuff t1 on to the tirion.
Hydrologist into redemption for the tirion.
While also blessing of kings guardian of ancient kings and fucking vicious fledgling.
Oh lord of the arena not stonehill mind actually in the deck.
So I signed up for that new hotness discord if anyone fancies friending me MuNought#6823.
Oh that was you v.
Also I made some friends watch some Haruhi at 2am to explain what Moe is.
Feels like Lucky Star would be the better option almost.
The only good thing about lucky star is the intro disclaimer never watched it.
Nws for bare back.
D9 doing a ladder grind R14 aggro decks only day.
Switches to pirate with a pledge for 'rank 9 in an hour' push.
Priest opponent turn 3 has his board wiped from wild pyro shenanigans.
Suddenly pirate warrior's not an instant 100% deck.
Possibly reno priest doing priest things.
Secret agent comes through.
Thought process next turn well they could have pulled my tirion I just topdecked ... or maybe it's just my nzoth which has nothing with their deck.
And they drop the nzoth XD.
I hate those opponents who stubbornly play out their last turn leave lethal on board pass turn then concede on my end...
<- behold white chain is a jerk.
So empty _.
I blame discord.
Yup all discords fault.
Home at last.
Saw someone in the parking lot for the office next door with a Path of Exile t-shirt.
My face in dungeon world rikght now.
Pretty sure that was my SR GMs face when we decide to run through a Police Checkpoint and he got to throw out the machineguns with Depleted Uranium Rounds P.
Today in hearthstone The Ice Stone has melted.
And oh look in a pre-constructed deck format brawl my opponent plays out their turns twice as slowly as me.
And drops the emote barrage when they finally get lethal in a control heavy arrangement.
Whoop de fucking do you're amazing at the game.
There is a blue ring of death equivalence on my twitch followings as all the streamers progressively pick up PUBG.
Ermergerds comic book TV show?
!weather Washington DC.
PatternSpider hi this is a test. please tell me you loaded your brain file properly.
