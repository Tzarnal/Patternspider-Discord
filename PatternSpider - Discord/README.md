PaternSpider - Discord
=============
PaternSpider - Discord is a Discord bot written in C#. It uses the [Discord.net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) library. This is a Discord equivalent to [PatterSpider](https://github.com/Xesyto/PatternSpider) but discards the plugin architexture. 

PatternSpider began life as an Exalted dice bot and still remains primariy a dicebot today. As such most of its plugins are for throwing dice. At the moment it suports simple generic dice expressions that can include math. Additionally it has system specific plugins for Exalted, NWoD and Fudge. 

If you want to see support for other specific systems please feel free to create a Issue for it.
